1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:06,900
let's start

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,019
closing if you made any pictures you
want

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,550
also send a pic

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,340
days that the aids any pic

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,640
was want us to see just do whatever you
want with it

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,750
set foot on Facebook no Instagram
Instagram is the word

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,790
um at this stage

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,770
I would like to thank our team

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,780
the house based team as I did before
we're working really really hard for a

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,560
year now

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,800
Fortis conference all in the yellow
shirts during the year

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,280
additionally all those guys in the
Blueshirts

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,920
during the conference give them please a
big hand for this

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,920
as you might have seen

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,290
the room back there the network
operations center

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,119
office whatever um offices might be
working

17
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,890
very very hard and sometimes a funny
things happen

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:17,850
we are working really really hard there
just watch

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,369
to them

20
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,420
well

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:30,420
open condom style guy

22
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,460
got it thanks thank you very much for
his inside

23
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,159
I think the running got just saying
despite this year

24
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:47,159
something else I did not want to forget
the road not want to forget this of

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,689
course the sponsors

26
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:55,570
this time I won't comment its gold
sponsors

27
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,160
silver sponsors without sponsors we
wouldn't be able to do this and without

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,670
you

29
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,799
of course meter

30
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,799
also your big hand for sponsors and I
get a handover

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,810
too candid thanks a lot thanks so

32
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,780
I'm gonna go little bit already
different contests that we're on

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,849
doing com so for starting off with the
possible challenge

34
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,340
a but few actually participate which is
great

35
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,049
a giving everything other won't match
them but

36
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:35,880
so we going to some of the details there
so all of you

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,989
received batch probably are maybe not

38
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,060
recognize that if you look at the small

39
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,440
yellow LED just about their pin 30 if
you reset the batter

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,040
replugged battery it was actually kind
of flash a little bit which look like

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,860
morse called I know was pretty fast but

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,940
the well we have to have radio guy so
and

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,810
some to actually video I'm off the whole
thing and try to

44
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,569
played back slowly which didn't work but
am should've

45
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,430
got something like am the el-ad 67

46
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,819
which means move that LED to pin 67

47
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,129
and if you do that you actually get
another flashing

48
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,459
so another Morse code

49
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,180
what's asked see real monitored at

50
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,560
know someone came up Skype got the idea
of I have to check a serial number

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,579
at a monitor or which is spending
somewhere here now there was not a clue

52
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,909
it was a funny one though butts its two
serial monitor if you connected through

53
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:32,720
USB

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,769
in the art we know you actually get some
information back

55
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,939
and too tricky was the actual had to
keep the el-ad

56
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:42,480
locked into pin 6&7 otherwise you
wouldn't get anything

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,689
so keeping their it's checking for it
all was just taken over

58
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,070
randomization number which can really
help you watch

59
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,020
so next up thing that you actually get

60
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,780
through the serial monitor don't be so
there's that randomness

61
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,350
a which is that and then you got this
what's asked of

62
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,370
following the right white rabbits keep
bomb so there was no white space left

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,190
for encoding

64
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,280
and some might have noticed if you
selected there's a huge line there

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,050
a many missed its and I mean white space
should have given it a clue that

66
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,230
white space as in space and perhaps I am
so use them

67
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,230
obviously some try white space ass
programming language was as nice as well

68
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,690
but

69
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,840
it doesn't compile at and no to
challenge was not fixing it to get a

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,520
compile

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
have a thanks for trying anyway um

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,070
so it was just simply converting it 2-0
than one

73
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,450
I get to choose which one obviously for
taps or space binary to ASCII

74
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:47,809
not too difficult and you should get the
reading the star sweet paper marks

75
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,569
yes I don't Olympic cryptic but that's
the game of

76
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,299
parcel on challenge so what it meant was
actually

77
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:58,430
on yearbook lacked there were a few
funny kind of

78
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,770
hash signs which are the same that you
have on your batch

79
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,069
and its also the markings kind of the
yessir quit but markings

80
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,389
and if you look at your batch a.m. there
are two stars

81
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,479
at the top and yes it's at look in the
stars and not between the source that

82
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,240
was not

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,250
the hole between the two stores so there
was lined a mop

84
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,020
so the two hashes stare at that look
into the sites of the starr said to get

85
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,949
the latter's

86
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,659
on forged vs sorry about that print
actually says

87
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,219
Gail wrong so the actually inflated
little bit so

88
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:35,490
this chaos lipid of but you could still
get said I would

89
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,370
except if the answer was actually in
between the fuse that we saw

90
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,910
which should lead to ask see H H

91
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,600
and since it's at it's a six-letter
words people just added random stuff

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,580
that the kind of aligned with it

93
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,690
a but now there was not a clue and

94
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,860
all of you should've seen I mean very
prominent in the book let's do to you

95
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,080
the site free in for which has lard up
zero on one's

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,840
I am the tip I gave TIF your viewer

97
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,169
close your eyes and you might be able to
read its I am because was bridal

98
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,330
so I obviously I could make it

99
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,610
really feel able for blind people are
you

100
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,490
up but

101
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,600
translate its and you get something like

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,759
in the final solution of the patch
possible replace

103
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,860
all the H with F f's which

104
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,570
obviously from ASI age H 22 ASI ffff

105
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,000
which is

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,520
read them as random as anything else
right even if it does look like

107
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,740
so that's the fine solution I am

108
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,949
which were received actually only twice
Sony two teams

109
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,349
a we're able to you finish off with the
right solution

110
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:50,509
I I have to GIF extra credits to Frank
Burns for

111
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,289
the extra extra effort that they put to
attend to

112
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,840
actually for up to analysis that one
here so

113
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,050
I am a gift that one letter which was
the I

114
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,759
at the beginning ants the kind of data
known playtest

115
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,120
text attack on the whole thing and
actually managed to break it

116
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,870
again without even realizing that it's
to Brive phone a

117
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,870
bought

118
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,880
on fortunate they only came in seconds
goes to win was

119
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,880
and still is an April please come off
act like to price so it's a

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,800
fifty euro while Turco's for Amazon so
moving on to the next context

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,770
that we have which was the batch hacking
contest a.m.

122
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,650
really pleased that we actually at a a
few people

123
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,250
which attended a workshop or some didn't
play with a batch

124
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,940
extending its weeks but the more pong
are other games but

125
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,450
the you came up with some interesting
funny at the years so the nominees

126
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,330
for the hacking contests are the RFID
reader batch

127
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,410
I quote still available I am

128
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,610
I think it's about one and a half
kilogram

129
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,180
I am i think is not marrying at the
moment

130
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,669
a but nice try so I extending its with
the RFID reader

131
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,279
as the name implies ass like a man treat
came from bad as well

132
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,409
I made a Magic eight Ball so you shake
it

133
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:43,419
also question like will POSCO be giving
the closing ceremony

134
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,590
and it says most likely yes so it
actually predict the correct

135
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,720
don't know how he did it but a man
should do that now we have max

136
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,080
giving in the an hour and RF the

137
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,030
fine for wilensky burke's so pretty nice
deferred mice for

138
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,290
Nani ke parts bought everything else a
kind of transmittal

139
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,880
to say a man

140
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,149
frequency and protocol so just place it
there

141
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,269
it will sniff it and would actually be
able to get the

142
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,320
secret she and which is kind of pre
shared secret and then you can read

143
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,410
all the key strokes from the wireless
keyboards

144
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,580
max nominee is T attention hungry
bastards

145
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,080
a made by Ralph I'll it's kind of a time
ago G

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,470
as a kind of old-school as a little

147
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,100
smiley up there what you see and if you
are to be

148
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,170
fading LED's 'em if you not paying too
much attention to it

149
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,540
it actually of a Sat smiley face stars
kind of getting

150
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,800
a more more I'm come slow with the
fading

151
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,070
not doing much and there's a sensor so
if you go close X the waiver that

152
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,880
a move something give some in touch in
Black Sea start smiling again

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,450
and kind of

154
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,779
be very excited and flash few of the
LED's a different callers

155
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,860
so thats you're a ten to go to bat

156
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,640
next one a state coffers taper I'm going
to the same direction so get

157
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,940
two of the rolling eyes and the mouth
which

158
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,840
had a few animations going through
through the different bonds so nice one

159
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,569
as well

160
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,660
and on we all expect its to get

161
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,939
what's BT alcohol preference and ELISA I

162
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:29,879
so you push a button you blowing to the
batch and we'll actually

163
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,819
are get you some reading back on for
chili and he was unable to get it

164
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:34,779
calibrate its

165
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:39,989
a couldn't find enough people yesterday
probably I'm at least not sober enough

166
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:40,679
to get in

167
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,339
zero value a.m. but to radically

168
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,190
it to work right

169
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,650
and band we had the like detector for
I'll a secret on

170
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,080
so if there's too much light to talk
about would actually not come out

171
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,750
the if you kind of put a little hand
over its due to make shadow

172
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,420
the crocodile what you see there which
will be animated comes out

173
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,590
and I'm well shows its face

174
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,400
and style of entry was so

175
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,730
a electronical a bubble level the

176
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,530
Calif a scale so he put it there have a
few as answers if you tilt it

177
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,870
their thing well actually kinda move to
these the side and if it hits the sites

178
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,470
a few really tell the to an angle

179
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,080
it will be

180
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,360
so that's another way you can use about
so those are gates

181
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,709
and nominees and we have the pretty
rough fights

182
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,370
could barely say there to say whose to
win or not we all liked them

183
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,640
I'm with FB like that you actually
played with a batch so that shows that

184
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,779
we are on the right track to make
something easy accessible for you guys

185
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,899
to extend its the Arduino workshop

186
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:52,899
where ya did a very good job but I think
it's deserving enough laws there as well

187
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,790
so we kind of made an agreement in the
end that

188
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,000
