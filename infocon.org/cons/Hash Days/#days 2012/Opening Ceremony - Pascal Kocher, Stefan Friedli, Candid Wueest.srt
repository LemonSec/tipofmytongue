00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,680
Association founded in 2008 so up

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,920
even more than three years we had little
time

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,370
getting the first estate up and running
what our goal the goal is the technical

42
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,910
arm knowledge transfer all members and
founders are

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,549
from Swiss IT security seem let's call
it professionals

44
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,349
of course ants we have a monthly meeting
it's called be on Tuesday that's why we

45
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:11,950
called

46
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,579
other you're drinking arm security
professionals

47
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,660
its in Zurich burn and Geneva and we
have a yearly conference and

48
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,920
that's where you at right now has States
by numbers

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,930
it's the third time I'm drink um for you
to be clear

50
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,530
the numbers in the brackets in the back
the first one is

51
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,329
last year the second one is the year
before and the fat number is actually

52
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,180
the current year so number of CFP
entries

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,579
we were stable at fifty total internal

54
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:46,340
emails we doubled to fifty thousand
we're going green

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,250
UC's also in the paper printed three
helped the paper printed from 200

56
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,489
kilograms to 100 kilograms that's why we
have

57
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,260
such a lot of blue shirt people carrying
around paper

58
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,599
sponsoring contacted

59
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,780
a lot of work during the year 221
sponsors and now

60
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,239
to the fun part time tu brute force a
suitcase lock

61
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,250
are one person here had a problem
opening issue because he forgot his lot

62
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:14,819
number so

63
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,099
yet about 30 minutes to open the three
digits

64
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:23,650
see case look so it's it's fairly doable
um the next line

65
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,530
items Conficker confiscated a customs
would have helped it's it's actually

66
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,090
picking said that the pig

67
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,070
a to picking seven to pick a gun so arm

68
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,770
its back your the third thing is not on

69
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,909

71
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,539

raise your hand who is playing lacrosse

72
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:46,640
in Zurich

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,909
if you're playing the cross in Zurich

74
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:54,900
you might want to change your email

75
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,320
on the wall of wasted with them just go
have a look change your email password

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,490
as your provider to use SSL

77
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,340
and make an encrypted connection thanks
a lot

78
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:13,340
as he later I hope tomorrow alright

79
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,080
good morning everyone so well

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,969
a scene still needing some coffee in
their I'll you up

81
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:27,020
we also got clock martyr so for those
not into coffee but still want a coffee

82
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,669
shop

83
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,349
go there to the fridge ice-cold club
mater

84
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,710
and eats I'm gonna bore you a little bit
with the Badgers

85
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,050
a.m. which you probably all received
does if you want actually carrying the

86
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,400
whole

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,880
evolution on their product you there a

88
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,039
with the ones from the lost and the
before last year

89
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,169
so we have a small kind of increase the

90
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,800
and we ended up with the acrylic and the
Arduino boards because we thought

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,010
well first vote it's a lot of work
because we doing them

92
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,409
a back in my home actually mentally
assemble all of them

93
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,430
which takes quite some time and we
thought the art we know

94
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,200
is actually nice way to be able to
easily extended because last year

95
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,610
people were playing with it but not as
much as we hope so we thought now it's

96
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,389
really easy

97
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,820
and I mention this going to be an art we
know workshop actually which

98
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,300
really set to you the the base crown of
how taxes it

99
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,130
I'll text and it and how to play with it

100
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,490
so in the process of it a yes

101
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,570
I played live it with a laser cutters
well actually

102
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,640
remote coastal is good I was in the US
so that sending pictures

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,170
and getting the results back and force
um so

104
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,170
I had to learn that it's not always what
use and you will get so it's not the way

105
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,740
the week

106
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,260
I as you see some of the Holts we're not
really cut through some stuff

107
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,620
is just missing um so yes

108
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,690
it's a lot of fun a but takes time is
all

109
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,140
so now we started with its a.m. 250 or
tween aborts

110
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,420
a fresh from China am and a few of the
laser carts

111
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,100
acrylic basis what you up to you rub off
all the paper

112
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,320
a sticky glue on the back side that's
why

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,070
all my fingerprints a holdover yes I
know it should

114
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,990
clean them but says sorry for that
please don't misuse them

115
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,600
AVM so screwed up the arena boards

116
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,160
got two entities you CD speakers should
have

117
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,950
blue and green mom the know what any
stuff double red ones and there are few

118
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,020
special ones with

119
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,980
rats green once a so yeah and also you
can change them as well if you want

120
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,280
we need it if you things to power it up
so

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,300
about 402 now all batteries it will run
about

122
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,400
14 hours so if you forget to

123
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,910
well switch them off during night or you
really in the need of a

124
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,070
light lights because you can sleep if
it's really dark

125
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,980
a do so but there are potentially USB
which kind of

126
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,060
overpowers it so you not losing power in
the battery

127
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,020
we do have a few spare once but need a
good explanation to go on

128
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,630
Justin

129
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,830
and yeah and up with the badges so

130
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,330
as always there is a hidden puzzle which
involves the batch

131
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,630
and debacle at and so on

132
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,510
I am so we do have prices for the first
one just reading the book let's

133
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,610
what you have to do at this time

134
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,610
um it's actually a6 character password

135
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,870
%uh no guessing this time at don't send
me all the six character variations no

136
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,880
that's not it's just important and I'm
gonna disqualify you

137
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,940
am although SOC and injuring engineering

138
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,289
is still out so feel free to get me some
drinks tomorrow

139
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,420
at the party it worked last year so

140
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,440
yeah and get if you flash it you
actually flushed away

141
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,470
at the first clue so just be aware of
that and

142
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,530
as I mentioned you can extend it so
young man shoes during the opening a

143
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,900
workshop in have Center

144
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,560
actually already extended his one so
nice gonna LED scrolling text

145
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,650
with if you tilt sensors and everything
you can if

146
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,810
alcohol breathalyzer tests and
everything so

147
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,340
whatever you need build its am

148
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,660
so if you're new to you aren't we know
relax

149
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,300
it's not as bad keep calm do Gangnam
style if you want but

150
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,760
them there too hardly know workshops too
many workshops

151
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,790
and there's y por when you can sign up a
space is limited

152
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,800
the bar if you have just not a problem
setting it up

153
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,860
go there and the hit you up there's also
stuff

154
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,310
to you pint so few of the extension
sensors and so on

155
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,590

167
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,990
hi

168
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,270
yeah apparently the surfing now good
morning

169
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,190
as is so works again so at their art

170
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,820
couple more things as senior have free
people on the opening ceremony this year

171
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,650
so

172
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,500
and afford one and stone like seven to
go so you should be good

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,820
nosy rosy I'm the last one so don't
worry about that so

174
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,890
mom

175
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,930
first thing first arm and all of you use
Twitter

176
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,550
and you like that and we would like you
to tweet about the conference what you

177
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,860
like but you don't like

178
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,160
on give us feedback if the speakers
feedback

179
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,350
but whenever you do that police use
hashed attack

180
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,500
hash hash days I know it sounds
redundant

181
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,360
and its kinda repulsive to some of you
because it's redundant

182
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,720
but if you just use hash days then

183
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,460
things get mixed up with other weird
stuff so

184
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,820
arm please adhere to that I

185
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,200
you can also follow us at Ash days for
schedule changes stuff like that we

186
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,020
don't have a lot of changes this year

187
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,260
but it might be useful at some point
bill bill also communicate those changes

188
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,230
in the room so

189
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,399
don't worry if you have questions

190
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,370
you get the Kansas there if you really
really shy and don't want to talk to us

191
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:44,930
so

192
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,769
that's okay hard feelings was a shower
tonight at this morning so it's not that

193
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:51,779
much of a problem but

194
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,470
still through just there for you so

195
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,759
arm a mention some schedule changes and
there's actually only one

196
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,980
or two depending on are you want to look
at it and we had to switch to Mark's

197
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,100
so mom on the print

198
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,949
schedules mark through if is listed
there speaking in the morning

199
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:16,009
and mark from house to house a bill to
be speaking the afternoon is actually

200
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,019
the other way around

201
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,149
so ipv6 will be from

202
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:24,620
2 a.m. 20 and marks fire will review
Mike worse by will view

203
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,449
will be from four for din this afternoon
on

204
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:34,130
yeah so let's get to the interesting
stuff

205
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,700
as you know mom every year it has days
we try to make it socially meant

206
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,250
because social event so the people in
the audience that work for

207
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,570
governments or biggest corporations
don't have to tell your employees that

208
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,600
you're going to a party

209
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,500
so

210
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,899
this year's actually a little bit
special because we've some changes

211
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:59,649
Tom was going to the party last year
raise your hands if you're awake enough

212
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:00,370
to do that

213
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,459
okay at school so we have the same place

214
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:06,510
as last year which is basically you go
out of the hotel

215
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,950
you walk 20 steps and you dare so you
don't have a lot of excuses

216
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,130
not to come and this time we have the
whole location to ourself

217
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,410
no on fancy nurses this time

218
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,800
butts I know I'm sorry

219
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,829
we can add to make changes because hacks
and hackers don't always mix well with

220
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:26,320
you know

221
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,339
people so so to make up for it we

222
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,079
I we want to make something a little
special this year

223
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,240
and arm we them

224
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,120
optimize stashed a slip it this year so
we have leftover money and we also talk

225
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,260
to our friends at

226
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,520
I O active so we actually have it the
stands

227
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:55,520
stock of free drinks for you guys I mean

228
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,000
3s and you can get them for free at the
bar over there

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,040
I don't know if that came across they're
free

230
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,750
okay so here's how this is going to work

231
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,790
um to get into the party you will need
one of these

232
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,779

ugly

233
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,399
response and you can get those starting
from

234
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,770
I think we'll start to put them up at
the registration desk

235
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,930
maybe an hour from now so just pick
yours up so

236
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,100
all the speakers and older people from
the comity

237
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,839
have dolls fancy pants and that's ABAP
for the reason

238
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,240
and those are the people who can get
free drinks

239
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,570

240
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,800
