2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,960
I'm giving a talk

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,590

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,460
why it's and how it's awesome and its

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,680

got me out here even though I'd know
this is going to be

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,830
relatively worthless because I'm
hungover it's fine

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,610
that's fine it doesn't doesn't yet the
point that compliance sucks

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,930
it's just makes me suck as a person but

12
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,610
you know I also appreciate you guys
sitting here and watching my sis

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,979

18
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,509
that's I give a talk about picking up
chicks

19
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,180
and I decided to have a makeup artist

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,160
turn me into like a five hundred-pound
to because I thought it was funny to

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,360
talk about picking up checks when I was
a really huge do

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,479

23
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,830
before my talk to like get all that
stuff made up like my

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,550

crazy process cos

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,349

28
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:55,649
but I'm not gonna talk about any that
cool stuff so there

29
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,130

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,520
%uh my credentials the outs

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,050

qualifications I have to give the start

36
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,459
its pretty much that up

37
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,209
those ur probably closer to what people
think my credentials are

38
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:35,159
her who I am I guess I'm I have one of
those

39
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:42,159
and we have all those key

40
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:48,299
screw you I get paid more hurt the
you're the idiot not me

41
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,129
it here I'll be like all you want me to
buy you another drink

42
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:55,329
yeah her ha wonder why

43
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,670
well because I know how to search google
images and I could change all that shit

44
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,909
to say Chris Dickerson on

45
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:05,939
it was a trick cuz I thought I was going
to get a really nice lock

46
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,269
on because I enjoy picking and that's
odd

47
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,900
sees a lock up but instead they gave me
the scrap it is a paper

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,599
which I thought was a total ripoff um

49
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,719
I got one of those two so did William
Slater I don't know who that is or why a

50
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,749
high-resolution picture of a CISSP is
just hanging out on the internet but

51
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,819
what every man is a CISSP do it it

52
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,260
I have a whole bunch of other crappy
survey cations experience and stuff

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,030
but it poet as a matter and Eimear

54
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,209
like literally doesn't matter in all
your the booth thing yeah

55
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,480
right on the matter on if you don't like
it

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,590
you don't like my attitude about it I
don't care you control me combined with

57
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:52,920
that

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,200
up cuz that's really funny

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,069
but is this isn't going to be any type
up like hacking talk

60
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,590
right and I can give you like tech tips
so if you want that

61
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,389
just leave because this will suck if you
want that I don't let slip

62
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,269
effect I do that for you just to set the
stage to make sure we're on the same

63
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,650
thing like just have a drink and

64
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,650
ignore me for a little while her up

65
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,040
when I gotta talk about o'day a market
talk about how cool

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,010
phones are or how you can dial them to
get shit

67
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm not going to talk about awesome web
aP's

68
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,090
because those are so crazy in complex
our phones cuz everybody talks about

69
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,500
that stuff right amaya

70
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,330
Andina talk about it for up sorry

71
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,770
right it's a compliant stock had

72
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,800
and they sucks on trying to make it suck
less but its good sucking away

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,180
up so why did I fight here to give some

74
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,130
crazy talk about compliance up

75
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,910
cuz to me compliance is an

76
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,009
it is it about anything other than just
human nature

77
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,979
rate like we just

78
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,590
we get into these situations and we
don't know what to do

79
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,690
we don't have any idea what to do and

80
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,020
we its did that should basic human
nature right

81
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,419
because we have this problem called
communicating

82
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,220
olive you hang out in mom's basement
window talk to people that's

83
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,770
party issue right had or the ones that
are like

84
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,389
oh I'd like to give a talk tools I freak
out on the front of people to look at me

85
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,080
I would like shit I'm so far

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,669
it's fine right but we have this history
of communication right

87
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,690
in its cause all of these problems as
soon as you open about anyone anyone

88
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,810
married

89
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,770
you know that as soon as you open your
mouth your shrewd like everything you do

90
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,560
is wall

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,639
it just all you have to do is say hi and

92
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,610
in a bit around a used old right you get
totally overhauled

93
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,080
it doesn't matter he did his own you for
no reason

94
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,050
cuz they KN hate intent so this
communication

95
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,240
causes these huge problems in our
existence

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,610
so we go from like caveman style.
communication

97
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,889
she looks absolute article who've
awesome

98
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,310
she's like screw you kid

99
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,900
to like really high-tech communication
which this is the most ridiculous pepper

100
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,550
diagram MCA

101
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,919
I was looking on rate my diagram earlier
and I was like I don't even know that

102
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,229
means

103
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,500
I have to maybe someone knows this

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,830
that I don't know what that is but it
has low

105
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,830
Red Cross is so maybe it's worse um

106
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,910
but look this communication thing

107
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,400
right let like anything that's new to us
it's completely

108
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,660
completely scary I like

109
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,950
it breaks us out because we know we're
gonna get owned as soon as we open up

110
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,060
our mouth there's no

111
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,080
there's no option other than failure

112
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,240
because success won't even be derived
right like the only thing we're gonna

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,720
feel is when it hurts and then good is
just good

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,110
that make sense rate so

115
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,260
so in order to feel safe in and try and
let's stop the bad from happening right

116
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,460
we make all these rules

117
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,250
we try make these rules so that

118
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,210
we can keep this communication that we
have going

119
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,970
without having the bad influence

120
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,520
I we don't want the bad so make some
rules or like hey

121
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,800
make these rules less bad will happen

122
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,010
which is crazy for

123
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,040
almost there have been arrested cuz I
was having a blast and collect arrested

124
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,710
but you know we'd make these things and
we

125
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,640
and we try and make guidelines anyone
her but guideline

126
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,700
right to try to rule guideline

127
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,919
it's just a line that you're kinda
supposed to follow

128
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,130
yet when I'm doing my DUI test

129
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,450
and I don't follow the line I get past
it

130
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,229
so then we make a standard because
guidelines are

131
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,340
just they're not really forceful enough
it's just like a suggestion

132
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,360
right it's a alright you should do it
this way but if you don't

133
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039
that's okay then we make it personal
right like

134
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,260
we actually make you feel bad for not
walking on the line

135
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,130
feel like it's a standard it's what
everyone else does

136
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,040
you're just obviously not as good as
everyone else

137
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,660
the standard way of doing it so

138
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,060
you know go home enjoy your little cry

139
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,140
on your own and in recognize that you're
not as good as everyone else

140
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,810
but but given that doesn't have enough
teeth

141
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,950
so we make a best practice

142
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,620
right because you like wall you know I
don't have to do whatever

143
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,780
every way other people do it my way is
better but if you don't do the

144
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,720
best way again you're just an
incompetent fool

145
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,550
you're just one other people who doesn't
follow best

146
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,830
practice which means you are not the
best however you do it sucks

147
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,100
does not number one and if you're not
number one

148
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,100
your your nothing else you're just
you're just not winning

149
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,430
right but people couldn't even figure
this out

150
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,280
the whole best practice thing evenly
attacked them personally and said that

151
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,500
you can't comply

152
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,790
to a level that that meets other
people's

153
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,720
expectations evil we told them that the
best people out there

154
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,890
your you're nowhere near this still
wouldn't do it so we made this thing

155
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,320
called

156
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,350
compliance Rohit

157
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,600
this is a forced standard

158
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,220
you have to do this if you don't do this

159
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,459
you don't do this thing that were
telling you to do even though we know

160
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,450
nothing about you

161
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,280
but we don't care who you are right bob
is a serious but matters you have to do

162
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,990
I tell you

163
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,670
so you know that picture is awesome

164
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,890
and it's the best compliant picture I
found

165
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,390
the rest from what lead up to that but

166
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,510
do you know what with the first
compliance infraction once

167
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,330
anyone history I have toys like

168
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,700
stop the give away here give something
away so it'll make it like a prize

169
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,600
I Hall you can have a laptop

170
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,360
how to sticker right spontaneously
combustible sticker

171
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,280
can you guess what the first compliance
back to Los

172
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,390
pretty close yeah

173
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,620
hoc scissors

174
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,450
I'm I'll give it to you later soho

175
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,910
this is a compliance infraction that's
what this is

176
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,260
the set the rules and standards made

177
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,530
someone broke those rules which I mean
with her if there's no one else around

178
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,510
at Balbriggan to

179
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,300
arm a tour bus up

180
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,220
but there was a penalty

181
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,140
that was put on that I don't care what
religion you are cuz

182
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,880
I don't believe in any of them sorry

183
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,490
but but it's a fact that was written in
the book

184
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,630
and since wikipedia books are always
backs than you know

185
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,230
it's real arm just like compliance

186
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,720
right cuz it the fact that it's real
anatoly does it supposed to do

187
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,010
um but from that moment on we started to
use these rules

188
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,199
as a way of operating K

189
00:11:55,199 --> 00:12:00,420
week we made all these rules up and we
want to create standards not just to

190
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,959
communicate but to live by

191
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,920
in general everything we do all day long
in

192
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,970
I don't I you know I was looking around
for like Swiss standard is other Swiss

193
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,620
standards that you have to adhere to

194
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,510
cuz a a I'm not smart enough to find
them I guess

195
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,579
farther but things that you have to do

196
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,850
or is it just the annoying counterparts
that you have in the states that all you

197
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,100
have to do stuff

198
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,240
it's a question your supposed to answer
it

199
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,000
or at least not are just say ft or
something

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,600
what was up d-pa

201
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,459
K in the end that that tells you exactly
how to protect your data

202
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,670
or how to protect data in general

203
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,079
kinda like the is where like
sarbanes-oxley

204
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,720
teaches you how to protect financial
reporting

205
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,780
which has nothing to do with your
business at all but just financial

206
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,480
reporting

207
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,610
or hipper which teaches you how to
protect pH II

208
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,780
which does nothing for taking care of
people

209
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,329
like health care industry is supposed to
make it so that you're healthy

210
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,839
or like when you're sick you get fixed
not that year

211
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,160
you know my herpes report can get
released

212
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,430
apps gonna be a life or PCI

213
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,380
at a good on and one had credit card
fraud recently they'll

214
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,020
with here yeah right house PCI working
for you

215
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,380
awesome it it is it states perfect

216
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,459
see any just it does all those great
stuff right

217
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,459
because it's there to protect you

218
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,240
what else is there high-tech those are
awesome high-techs hilarious

219
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,900
are of any %uh view work in health care
but it's really funny

220
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,290
because it says implement controls or

221
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,870
you'll have to disclose that the pH I
was compromised

222
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,980
how cool is that you like

223
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,640
a put a firewall in I don't have to tell
people I got old

224
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,260
whatever dude give me money

225
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,530
then you have all these other great ones
right there's all over the place

226
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:16,240
up you have open source ones that have
nothing to do with your business at all

227
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,550
at all nothing to do

228
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,819
with your business yet the veins the
bitch who makes this stuff

229
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:28,430
thinks it's the only way to protect
everything idiot you don't even know

230
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,130
we're protecting

231
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,150
he doesn't does deep all love you like

232
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,920

awesome all the way down to how you make

233
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,860
every dollar see protected a properly
with garbage

234
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,370
how meanwhile you have this

235
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,690
awesome re: so of love the compliance

236
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,130
problem that we have that we have this
whole industry that's built around

237
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,760
compliance

238
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,569
right you have these vendors

239
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:03,959
hey and all they do is sit around and
wonder how do I get more money out of

240
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:04,329
his

241
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:08,079
idiot that has the applying complied to
these

242
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,209
rules that have nothing to do with his
business at all

243
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,579
sole Solea corruption thats good

244
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,600
I still have that teacher at

245
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,670
best teacher ever hub

246
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,750
corruption right fixes everything

247
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,250
but they're like head we got some more
stuff

248
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,730
iight intrusion detection and prevention

249
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,399
that sounds wicked cool and I know that
we can get that stuff in every piece a

250
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,110
compliance

251
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,440
because the people who made those roles
have no idea what they're talking about

252
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,060
soap we give them something like
intrusion prevention

253
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,220
how awesome would that be to put in the
standard cuz everyone needs to be

254
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,260
preventing intrusion i mean sometimes
you want all the trees but

255
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,209
you should prevent it right and data
leak prevention

256
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,810
how cool is that not only can you
prevent people from breaking into you

257
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,570
you can prevent yourself from leaving
cool

258
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,070
by it put it is part of compliance
mechanism then you get

259
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,250
anti-virus and anti-malware

260
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,310
gotta have that because if you don't
you're not compliant or

261
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,920
if you don't use that idiot yet

262
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,130
if you just didn't do stupid stuff you
wouldn't get hearses

263
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,339
but whatever but sell a more crap like
strong authentication

264
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:31,279
that's a they do there's tons of stuff
we could sell

265
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,010
mean What's Wrong of is like hundreds of
millions of dollars that uses dump into

266
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,779
and then somebody goes hub password one
click a

267
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,140
I got access like but it was

268
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,390
excess strongly but

269
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,540
it is %um did it hard

270
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,649
I and they'd did it hard to you

271
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,440
a you have integrity checking that's
really great

272
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,600
you know a hub it's just it just it
blows my mind

273
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,390
blood management all these things are in
compliance you have to have these

274
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,419
now none of this stuff is actually bill
for your business for you

275
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:16,329
this is random crap people made up for
you to buy

276
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,439
are you get that right like I'm not

277
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,550
that's a fact people made stuff up

278
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,949
and then made some rules and said home

279
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:30,159
you know we can't do we can make these
rules and then make crap for people to

280
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,320
buy in and tell them that they have to
be

281
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,250
do these roles and Buyer Credit help

282
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,570
that's that's the craziest scam i've
ever heard of minutes awesome it went up

283
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,230
$300 billion dollar market called impose
act

284
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,630
I hate anyhow firewalls the like

285
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,840
be all and all like thats

286
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,070
their stuff will save you there's whole
compliance controls like sets

287
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,120
but PCI it's as your have a firewall

288
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,770
hua hai why do you have to have a fire
all

289
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,409
but so what so because it's gonna stop
something

290
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:11,919
show me anytime that of Ireland stopped
me on a pen tester

291
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,399
any of you guys are penned dozens hours
be blown away

292
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:19,280
alb it would just be the magic unicorn
riding down from

293
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,440
in heaven giving me a god damn golden
ache

294
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,570
like it's just ridiculous it doesn't do
anything

295
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,190
it just lets the bad shit through easier

296
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,840
okay so does technology is right

297
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,909
let's let's talk about basic firewalls
their basics stateful firewalls

298
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:46,330
right how many can actually block TCP
ports

299
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,470
yeah one mornin

300
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:56,570
there's more than that does it time KK
even then you can get around it

301
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,899
that sucks

302
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:03,040
kisses it probably doesn't he would get
mad about this

303
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,899
ordered as lead whatever dude others
just pay more money

304
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:09,950
have the auditor dude just the 10

305
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,159
get deep does go check stuff of

306
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,290
putting crap in Iraq make sure that the
performance my entire network Sox

307
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:24,889
and then blame it on security that's
ridiculous

308
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:28,429
so were all sad about it right

309
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:32,560
yeah I N you know but I have to give it
to compliance for couples

310
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,260
right other make a sad

311
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,300
it has made people aware risk

312
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,850
whereas before they biggest kinda like
didn't care

313
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,649
or they cared but like they really had a
reason to talk about it

314
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:50,000
and we had no reason to go to
Switzerland and give talks

315
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,030
so at school I get to go meet new people

316
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,260
like to hang out with friends of mine
that live in other countries awesome

317
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,230
thank you um it was teeth

318
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,750
but we had some really cool way is to
force executives to do

319
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,340
on dumb stuff and then they do it in a
really dumb way

320
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,470
just like spike us it up its

321
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,200
well you have to have a nine care to
password there like great a day

322
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,560

323
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,580
period you know if you like so good just

324
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,179
spent 10 seconds thinking about it

325
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,730
no I'm a doctor I can remember password

326
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,950

328
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,409
on what you're telling me how I'm sick
if you can remember a freakin

329
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:49,790
9 character password during an idiot

330
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,080
to make money rain from the sky I

331
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,000
like your kisses think about something
and if you call it compiles money does

332
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,280
the

333
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,260
paid like come did falls from the
heavens

334
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,290
thats awesome but

335
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,690
you know some it's awesome I it's like
gay Thank You compliance

336
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,419
but it's not some other cool stuff for
us

337
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,750
it's completely misdirected her funding
and goals

338
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,000
anyone have this problem the eighty
percent problem

339
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,870
was a made-up statistics statistics
matter

340
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,330
right but eighty percent of the budget
is spent

341
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,679
on less than five percent the
environment

342
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,870
because of compliance because people go
all man

343
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,360
I can make it rain money but only for
compliance

344
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,710
so how do I do this are I'm gonna get
five million dollars

345
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,070
and I'm apply of five million dollars to
this host

346
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,360
but stores my credit cards

347
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,720
now I'm all manufactured

348
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,760
but I have to be complying with the
stuff and look who cares if people are

349
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,639
hacking

350
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:05,169
are SCADA systems and turning on porches
that

351
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,889
weld shit and is making in case people
around the plant book

352
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:14,080
doesn't matter will spend the money on
the credit cards

353
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,990
cuz at source post the dough

354
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,380
right like isn't that ridiculous

355
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,200
isn't it ridiculous that what okay we
should protect the patient

356
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,460
data why is the heat on in the operating
room

357
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,470
like older sis age back controller and
people acted interviewed on because we

358
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,360
think it's funny

359
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,740
will should use that because the dudes
dying

360
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,220
they're like but his patient
informations

361
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,710
just behind new box know what can you do
it

362
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,030
these days I'll is dead a matter

363
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,130
bags those dead just with a relationship
right

364
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,800
so it's just it just so misdirected it's
created this lemon market for us right

365
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,210
and reviewed studies like lemon markets
& Finance

366
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,120
right so the seventies to pointer
McClement markets

367
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,310
the the main indicator lemon market
right is where the buyer has a

368
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,350
disproportionate level of knowledge

369
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,179
up that market than the seller k so

370
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:27,830
me as the buyer I don't know half for
the crap that sellers talking about

371
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,220
Zellers expert the market I'm just try
to buy stuff

372
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,260
right like ama a real good

373
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,889
ranch on cars fix motorcycles here and
there

374
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:43,929
but on I'm just not that good with cars
and concept supply a.m. but

375
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:48,360
I don't know the intricacies of cars as
well so what I go to a car dealership in

376
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,159
some researches ball blues puke out crap
the only thing I could do is like

377
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,660
straight Google know you're lying cuz
Google citywide

378
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,480
right but other than that I have no
indicators so they create

379
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,360
indicators for you right anyone have a
warranty on the car

380
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,200
it's nothing it's an indicator in order
to bring you up to a level of comfort

381
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,880
to identify that this product is better
than another product

382
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,620
even though it's completely fictitious

383
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,419
it's a psychological trick in order to
bring you up to level up assuredness

384
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:25,340
that the product that you're buying is
the right product

385
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,470
anyone see those things happen in
security

386
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,500
they would have Flyers for the crap

387
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,460
sweet logos you know give all his

388
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,360
and we get an iPad recently you know
like these are all

389
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,370
indicators they have nothing to do with
the quality the product at all

390
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:50,130
its marketing crap and compliance is
driven this lemon market so deeply in

391
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:56,260
the security that we cannot recover from
it

392
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,820
so give to someone to blame which is
kinda good

393
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,370
right how can this box got hacked

394
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,650
was there a PCI stuff yeah but why did
this box kak

395
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:13,160
out oh I was following these roles would
say protect this stuff

396
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,610
that box was in this entire also

397
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,780
it's not my fault maybe if you wrote the
compliance review

398
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:28,070
it would negate act again totally
ridiculous

399
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:35,070
right it makes us virgin forces arse to
look at things that urgent unimportant

400
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:38,179
if our businesses to make cars

401
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,179
who gives shit about the credit cards

402
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,820
it's not a car make the car

403
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,309
that's your job you're a doctor

404
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,669
fix the person who's bleeding fixed n

405
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:56,360
your mean whatever it is you do services
your

406
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,700
freakin masseuse give somebody a back
rub the way

407
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,610
worry about that stuff do your job

408
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,710
and if you do your job securely your
actually gonna make a difference

409
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,440
if you do it would show you what should
your business great

410
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,809
I hope you do so

411
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,950
this is what I have to say to compliance
not thank you

412
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,370
home

413
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,990
so why doesn't the stuff where why
haven't we have these like make-believe

414
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,140
rules worked

415
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,260
force right so first of its completely
inefficient

416
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,530
right we have a canvas

417
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,280
it's this big

418
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,830
I have a campus it's this big after draw
circle that's epic

419
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,010
you have a campus that this big and you
have to draw the same size certain on

420
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,020
your campus

421
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,480
and you have all the time wall big if
draw same size circle

422
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,650
its its absolutely absurd to think

423
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:06,200
that a standard is going to fit the
unique nature %uh each business

424
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,620
cuz it is unpredictable

425
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,970
does anyone know their business

426
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,200
you know your business you know it
you're the CEO

427
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,350
yes you are no you

428
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,320
smiling nodding yeah the CEO

429
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,049
you know you better you are the CEO who
are you

430
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:36,570
what do you do so you think you know the
business

431
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,780
you do who have business %um

432
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,340
ha and so your security program

433
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,980
protects the watches

434
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,360
was a project

435
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,809
right so to your whole security programs
focused on

436
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,049
protect the move that heard you have
standards and stuff for europe

437
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:05,940
follow okay

438
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,929
do you think most businesses are like
that

439
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:13,260
why

440
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,909
I mean it takes a couple questions right
you need to go I work for a watchmaker

441
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:20,100
so what should we do we should protect
the watch

442
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,150
stuff anything that has to do with
making a lot as we should prolly protect

443
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:24,700
that

444
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,750
and the other stuff we can get to at
some point

445
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,360
but most people don't do that break
because

446
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,500
they have their sights set on compliance
because they

447
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,309
the this urgent and unimportant things
directly in front of them constantly

448
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:40,250
nagging them

449
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,809
constantly pushing them around so they
can stick your head in the sand and

450
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:47,179
ignore it

451
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:51,720
because at the end of the day they
comply

452
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,890
and compliances awesome as criminals
want us to comply

453
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,080
because as soon as we comply we know
that we have a template

454
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,700
it's like giving your defense in a
football game

455
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,919
to the other group they know all your
formations

456
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,510
they know how you're gonna move it down
the field they know how that you're

457
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,000
gonna score

458
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,140
they know exactly what you're gonna do
if they're moving to the left or to the

459
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,860
right

460
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,220
so they can just go oh whoa here's all
the flaws

461
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,990
thank you for showing me I can attack
you this way

462
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:29,840
and what's even cooler is let's say
there's one flaw that you find

463
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,900
in a company that's PCI compliant

464
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,490
do you think that that flaw will work on
every other

465
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,700
by it PCI company sure

466
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,320
because they're doing it the same way
they have to

467
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,659
again crazy

468
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,360
right criminals do it right

469
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,850
right you have this this market the drug
market

470
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,789
four billion dollars you have our market
which is way better

471
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:03,799
like we make that suck drugs been around
for ever

472
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:06,980
we just own stuff to make tons of money

473
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,390
right cuz this is what we're doing a
compliance

474
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,220
I hate this is what's up a compliance
right now

475
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,730
is that he would be crap on anybody is
compliant and it's awesome you're in the

476
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,460
news

477
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,970
I bet you're complying at some point

478
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,600
because it that much easier to attack
you

479
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,440
user to focus on school bees paper

480
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,390
K that's confusing

481
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:40,520
so what do we do like if we can't follow
compliance what do you do

482
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,350
i think thats that's been one of those
problems that people have a really hard

483
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,409
time tackling

484
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:49,380
and and I'm gonna say some stuff area
code stupid I know that

485
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,169
but tell you businesses don't operate
this way

486
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:57,330
I mean Alexa told I see a lot love the
Fortune

487
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,370
1000 like the world global fortune 1000

488
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,740
and most of them don't do it

489
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,240
right most love them don't actually
protect what matters

490
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,020
most to the business

491
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:20,020
they protect your InfoSec teams vanity

492
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,289
thank you Tim for helping me think about
that today

493
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,880
they protect vanity you think you know

494
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,340
see bill the program around what you
think you know without ever asking a

495
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,350
question

496
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,299
that is the most vain thing ever

497
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,700
00 I know the business really you
started it

498
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,360
you know every piece to the business

499
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,380
of a fortune 50 company of course

500
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,039
if you're in a fortune 50 company your
damn thing about the company

501
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,630
you know your low-paid he's never about
it even then you probably don't know

502
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,659
your piece very well

503
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,309
sorta what companies care about right
what how what would a Muslim care about

504
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:03,730
care about their product line

505
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,820
now whether you're a service company or
whether you're a

506
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,450
manufacturing company air you make
widgets are you provide

507
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,549
care whatever else right that your
product every business has a product

508
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,970
yeah and you care about your product

509
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,929
will make your money care about the
brand

510
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:27,900
because if you sock people say that you
suck

511
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,690
iraqi big money

512
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,059
employees anybody care other employees

513
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:42,909
be you should care about you can please
cuz they're awesome

514
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,159
most people don't care about their
employees do they think that they can be

515
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,669
replaced

516
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:52,370
and and you know what even if you could
replace your employees

517
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,779
think about it this way my entire
manufacturing

518
00:32:55,779 --> 00:33:00,799
factory was firebombed everyone's dead

519
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,909
can I make money mall i don't have any
employees

520
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:08,549
okay that's gonna take you some time to
backfill that's not so

521
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:12,400
you really have to compensate for those
things

522
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,929
right they may be expendable a
replaceable

523
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:19,059
but it has it's so important to your
business that they exist

524
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,110
but they need to be part of that
protection program

525
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,370
you care about the bottom line I mean if
you're making money

526
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,480
and then you go to the bank account you
don't have any left

527
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,150
your in a lot of trouble because then
you're not gonna have any employees

528
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,200
could you not to pay me learn about

529
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,919
do any of these things existing
compliance by the way

530
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,940
any of these concepts

531
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,440
now booth sorry

532
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,669
work what else wait

533
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:56,299
K so how do we how do you actually do
this right does it all

534
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:59,400
boats the radical not it's really easy

535
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:05,340
shut up stop your opinions don't matter
at all

536
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:12,340
it for the most part most of us are not
in a position that matter

537
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,629
as much as we wanna bloating hold our
sakin

538
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:21,310
tell ourselves out importantly our your
non porn

539
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,819
we just are editor at a big company
you're even less important

540
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,520
because they don't care they're just
there because you're supposed to be

541
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,679
there

542
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,879
ray so make it work like really make it
work

543
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,649
do something ask them questions

544
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:42,100
become part of the business start
thinking like them

545
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,589
and if you don't know how to think like
20 by the way if you think you can think

546
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:46,220
like them

547
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,390
you're doing it right now unless you ask
them exactly how they think about

548
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,429
everything

549
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:56,940
you don't know them you have to accept
that you don't know shit about them

550
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,089
so all I think the CEO at like this did
you ask him

551
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:03,940
no I just know that he would like that
well

552
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,520
you are wrong as wrong gets and tell you
ask him and then if your answer is the

553
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,950
same

554
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,970
great you were right only after that

555
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,930
till then dead wrong

556
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,180
and then you have to do work

557
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,140
crazy yeah it is no use kids bloodshed
in setback your desk in

558
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,010
be farm artichokes

559
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,799
yeah I mean you have to do work

560
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:35,500
you have to focus on what's going on in
the business

561
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,810
you have to figure out how the business
runs who's in charge

562
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,420
used to be able to understand what your
products are and how does

563
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,720
any of your testing actually do things

564
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,020
with your products said in your brand

565
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,640
a one other companies mission statement

566
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,839
to people to a secure jobs

567
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:04,230
fact everything you're doing

568
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,010
doesn't apply to your company because
that mission statement is the summary of

569
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,080
what that company

570
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,880
is and if you don't know it

571
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,600
it everything that you do every day to
support it

572
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,589
you are not doing your job

573
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:23,810
sorry call me a jerk kid now country

574
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,240
don't care okay but you're just my heart

575
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,540
supporting PCI compliance dirt no one's

576
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,839
no one's company is like we're gonna be
the most PCI compliant car manufacturer

577
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,279
in the world

578
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:42,290
there isn't one of those their isn't I
mean you can make one

579
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,990
it does prove me wrong be a juror we'll
do our business our lab you anyway but

580
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,760
you suck had bad mission statement

581
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,470
but really I mean I'm joking about it
but on the Hyatt

582
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:59,510
cuz if you're not doing things to
protect that mission statement how the

583
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,150
company operates and what it does and
how it does it

584
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,720
and that unique image that it has

585
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,870
not do any he just

586
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,109
put shit Iraq where the money come from

587
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,380
does anyone know where the money comes
from through again visa no does it come

588
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,670
from

589
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,290
these are views into anything

590
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,390
they don't own money all the owners a
local

591
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,150
screwed up is that we have to apply

592
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:36,190
a protection standard on a business that
doesn't exist

593
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,690
more than one little logo are thing

594
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,460
that up bank owns and a processor

595
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,880
transferred the money from and that you
put money into

596
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,080
be easily little logo and there's no one
tell you how to protect your company

597
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,010
if I want to know how to protect the
logo I'll talk to them

598
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,500
everything else they need

599
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,970
not only that you have to think about
attacks

600
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,589
okay if you're thinking like them you
find out these things in the business

601
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,080
and you know what the mission statement
is

602
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,960
how can you attack your mission
statement

603
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,010
if my job is to build the highest grade

604

606
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,180
qualified polluted then I'm not gonna
have my mission statement

take these dumb domains in applying to
stuff a sock again

618
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,430
or we can actually look at it somewhat
intelligently

619
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,839
and we can take generic concept that all
these management people know about

620
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,370
and their big words they make a sample
was mark

621
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,839
right confidentiality but also levels

622
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,630
and you can make criticality it when
they hear things are critical to get all

623
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,880
like

624
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,700
perky in excited and then you talk to
them

625
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,060
you have an interview with them and you
say hey guys look I just wanna know

626
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,940
what's important to you a what have a
conversation management says hey what's

627
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,830
important to you

628
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,930
regis assume you know but ASCOM it too

629
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,279
it's a phone conversation you get the
your crazy shit that you would never

630
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:51,609
hear otherwise

631
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:55,089
you know your company doesn't stop there
like man is one thing

632
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:58,819
freaks me out it might that's what I do
all day

633
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:02,450
and then you can start ranking it
because when babe rank it

634
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,609
right this isn't Nessus this is

635
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:09,810
feeling mode this is their feelings

636
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,220
security is a feeling and if they think

637
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,620
this is high in their feeling area

638
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:21,290
and you protect their feelings a badge
in the support you're gonna get

639
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,109
I give somebody a hold when they need it

640
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:28,529
orders have a neighbor apt right it's
just its

641
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:32,200
its unbelievable the protection that you
get a program like that because

642
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,650
your protecting the businesses be links

643
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,040
any will protect businesses be leaks

644
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,440
to people the hugs

645
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,330
right and you protect your customers
feelings that's the big problem

646
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,980
that most people don't have this you
have to wait these things and sometimes

647
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,850
the wrong right sometimes

648
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,130
you're like now look okay forget it this
is actually a high in this one's

649
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,890
actually low

650
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,240
because what you're talking down the
alleged like marketing materials a

651
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,630
medium really

652
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:10,750
you like but is not the shit you give
people and they're like I it's true but

653
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,230
but it's important I want somebody else
to see it later right but

654
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,579
what's talk about availability other
lady integrity or because I want you put

655
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:18,950
like

656
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,050
racist jokes in it as appalling are
whatever

657
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,390
but you can work this out with them you
get to have conversations it would never

658
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,349
have what the business

659
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:30,390
not how many Nessus 5093

660
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:36,430
whatever the hell it spits out who cares
about crap executives care

661
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:41,310
doesn't make sense you can score the
staff and even do look a little math the

662
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,040
things that polio matter but people like
to see map stuff

663
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,290
you know dual-core mascot women say this

664
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,349
you're protected 5 cool

665
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:54,720
the little tiny set up things that are
five

666
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,300
so anything the whole patient data 25
we're gonna protect

667
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,220
cost this much money there like will
protect everything

668
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,020
ocean want to protect on the one well
all these

669
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,530
at all these systems are gonna cost this
much money

670
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,640
and they go I'll what's protect before
cuz I know it's been a crazy amount

671
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,030
okay fine former is this many systems as
much stuff this much money and they go

672
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,990
protect five today in they will protect
4 at some point

673
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,520
awarded work on it you like cool

674
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,310
now amazingly enough you actually
protected the business

675
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,839
instead of just trying to apply rules to
protect everything which is

676
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,270
absolute

677
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,599
does the stupid right I mean you say
essence

678
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,829
it's just dumb easy right but out alive
you will do it

679
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:50,349
they're too busy reading rules and regs
and get a check marks

680
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:53,760
gay it's really boring I got it

681
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,130
so we lost live in darkness

682
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,960
was but Akers get all this money by Liz
Cass cars

683
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,320
and it's unfair that sucks

684
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,890
and s is

685
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,510
sucks and it's unfair and

686
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,030
the the problem is so much more about
our perception

687
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:24,030
than anything else because you know we
expect our users to do

688
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,960
we expect our users to clean up their
own shit

689
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,710
this is what we expected all of our
users they're like oh you took a dump

690
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,609
does your dog brake cleaner shut up
throwaway

691
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:38,359
you like I'm a dog good claim that up

692
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:42,079
I put that they're all purpose trip

693
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,560
that's my shit literally my movie not
yet do your best with your beloved clean

694
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,240
I think that's fine

695
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,490
movie ate the same thing every day as
good

696
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,550
I

697
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,290
ok I up so I a low that they see right

698
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,700
so my my statement that I learned from
this conference is that information

699
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,339
security programs

700
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,810
a physical manifestation of our own
vanity

701
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:13,040
a programs that we write down in
compliance

702
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,369
specifically is a manifestation of the
vanity of those who created it

703
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:22,440
it has nothing to do with your business
or program

704
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,460
for your life it has to do with someone

705
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,589
don't like this rate on paper

706
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:31,839
pay like you gotta do that out oh

707
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,230
anything about you you have to do it
anyway and we are together as be

708
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,520
because of that so because we're in
Europe I started at subzero

709
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,680
and I'm only gonna go to Step 0 we need
to think of things correctly

710
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,170
like this is the section not this

711
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,680
that's not the section there's no trick

712
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:01,400
K that do the rapist

713
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,640
damn proof but

714
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,550
that is not tricky dole teach people

715
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,839
that this is a trick right

716
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,510
you wanna fight a war fighting with this
don't fight it with that

717
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,780
castles will get bombed by these dudes

718
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,609
that also effect right

719
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:30,140
anyone in here ever been packed

720
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,760
G hell yah yeah I mean I know there's
plenty of papers that show all my grades

721
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,619
and shit like

722
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:38,780
you look it up I don't

723
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,329
anywhere else you know the balls and say
it school

724
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:46,960
you got it anyone had a virus I how bout
that anyone at a virus

725
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,780
you're a anyone been hacked

726
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,800
you're a we learned something today is
that we have

727
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,300
all been hacked

728
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,990
hour while so hard why is it wise

729
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,710
easy to go %um and I had mad viruses but
I've never been hacked

730
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,349
complete Hall do you recognize that

731
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,079
your security controls were compromised
and stuff was installed on your machine

732
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:12,680
that was supposed to be

733
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,099
no I guess virus you like ol

734
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:21,550
you go all who need you're not magic
johnson you can just pay for the aids to

735
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:26,990
go away

736
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:32,579
up I'll just leave a note this I'm done

737
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,980
as my favorite quote from Doctor Who

738
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:40,790
is in in really what that's about to me

739
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:47,790
is we keep trying to do this overly
complex highly technical stuff

740
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,140
when the easy solutions will work

741
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:56,550
we're just afraid up doing the work

742
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,960
and the arm problem I'm done ranting I'm
gonna go

743
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,460
you can't have my hangover

744
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,109
early now offers any questions I don't
say anything

745
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:15,089
now K in the words about facts with Kid
Rock

746
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:16,099
sleep I
