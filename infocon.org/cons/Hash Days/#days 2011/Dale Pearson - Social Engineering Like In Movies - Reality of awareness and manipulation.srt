15
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,039
but then the AM subliminal hacking
website where talk about

16
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:14,479
I am hypnosis NLP session engineering
body language market specials that sort

17
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:14,869
of thing

18
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,360
and just in general I'm a geek so levels
of the tech stuff than

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,979
it just turns me on so if you ever

20
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,700
14 Jan of a look enough the see my talk
last year or patches for online

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,360
aspects about the different types a
social engine and aspect about the

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,250
about two years a research done on
hypnosis and no linguistic programming

23
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,340
and really

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,439
well that came down to is how powerful
languages for some curry want to talk

25
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,159
about then but didn't have time

26
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,350
was how body language and Mark
expressions

27
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,369
play into that so this time that we can
talk about

28
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,860
one of the reasons the once again this
talk was

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,710
a sweet lotsa people and they say that
they watch programs that lie to me and

30
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,229
stuff

31
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,259
I like us it's true so you can just look
at someone like straight away you know

32
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:04,350
they're lying on top

33
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,829
sorry as wanna talk about

34
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,570
what we see on the screen and and I was
it

35
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,299
what really makes sense what doesn't
make sense is a such thing

36
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,410
has like a human lie detector so nice
law that I'm really

37
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,670
try and focus on how important awareness
is so we spoke about

38
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,620
last time hand porn when it's languages
but how important is

39
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,250
about what we do body justice and me lay
my hands around

40
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,630
and touch briefly on soap
specialisations a perspective but for

41
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,239
everybody in their day-to-day lives

42
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,549
how you can utilize some this
information for manipulation

43
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,769
so with all the talk to give

44
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:46,790
I don't expect you to agree with me
effects

45
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,560
I have you disagree mean challenge me
but at least at some point

46
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,290
keep an open white my the an open mind
and

47
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,109
just take away from this talk in this
that one little thing you think the

48
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:00,220
benefit so

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,459
when you watch TV and watch the movie is
we all know

50
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,519
that it's just like real life to entire

51
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,410
this'll stuff this is real hacking naps
Otis

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,449
mobile screens do my thing the blow jobs

53
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,530
that optional or maybe

54
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,639
this more matrix were here in the zine

55
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,510
her sheer love outlet make the hackers

56
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,280
my point is that

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,350
know what we see on a TV others it's not
really release

58
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,370
is dramatization but what you know where
is the mix so

59
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,290
does not talk to a bit about some other
stuff that I really like

60
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,049
and Kiana high-level I'll your body
language and Mark expressions obviously

61
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,470
lotta stuff you guys a party be familiar
to some extent especially if it's a

62
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,959
made soap opera on the TV so when my
favorite shows about this or stuff is

63
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:54,829
the Mentalist

64
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:00,970
he watches the Mentalist cool and co-ceo
some the mind games he doesn't have a

65
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,910
city there's a body language and how you
can tell you know someone to smoke about

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,250
the tooth and nails in

67
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,579
in at that they were ap contest tonight

68
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,440
Criminal Minds as well %uh they focus on

69
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,500
in asbestos behavior what people are
doing

70
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,608
but really the crux of it the show

71
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:24,190
so people to lie to me who seem like to
me okay least polish off the ice

72
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,889
so let me is absolute briancon says
brawl this body language and Mike

73
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,180
expression awareness

74
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,270
to the masses I am but the one problem
is

75
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,960
some list this but no bullshit but

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,800
this is the thing people is great
because people want to show and that

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,140
unlike right so I can

78
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,880
tell with my wife is lying because I
watched her and bugsy

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,230
this is pretty common knowledge most
even know this that

80
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,650
Naveen they were talkin Julia eighty
percent

81
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,990
about interaction isn't what we're
saying it I was saying

82
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,110
the tonality not only the words

83
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,600
you know how understanding how my arms
are moving on my feet are doing

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,090
all this stuff expressions my posture
this is how really where

85
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,380
they communicate in so

86
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,780
other question to you guys we think it
was its

87
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,890
that it made it makes sense

88
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,990
the party thinkers some like this

89
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,010
I'm not talking about how was it that
makes them up in a bucket spin round

90
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,530
thing house up

91
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,540
I'm also not talking will when himself

92
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,650
demonic type was it and definitely no
but the Harry Potter

93
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,650
a that thing is

94
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,360
so went ok

95
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,909
was its I'm not to let someone appointed
a

96
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,289
one really talking to is about this real
thing

97
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,729
the real the closest thing we really
have to human polygraph

98
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,370
the these things like this there are
such things as real was its

99
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,669
base Israel which is quite amazing skill
for detecting deception these

100
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,069
or different types of skills that are
going to a moment the basie this

101
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:16,610
the soul was a turn came around for a
project that was run

102
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,009
a long time ago close the dow danny's
projects and they changes project later

103
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:21,500
on

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,969
tinkered with this product I don't like
you know why %ah can get someone to tell

105
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:25,580
me why they

106
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,969
changed it and to the with a project to
base the countless San

107
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,680
definition of someone being a truth was
it and the reason is radical the does is

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,900
put that I can say

109
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,560
because it this great guy coat attorneys
and he was a religious man any basic

110
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,080
decide to give Paul his belongings

111
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,870
I lived on the street ever he was by of
his mind

112
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,250
the stick around with his lamp

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,819
you can see in the picture I don't have
the dog was his butt but they see him to

114
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,490
shine in this lamp in people's faces no
its a is on trial look for honest man

115
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,330
and this is I guess why they called this
product they were trying to text

116
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,479
honesty in the section and just has a
lot to share information with you

117
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,139
as well as looking for honest man I'm
not sure if there's a reason why the

118
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:09,979
device mandate

119
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,569
in the real big fan of masturbating in
public to

120
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,370
present Sun

121
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,870
with the project told read it was a the
thaisnews product but

122
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,250
this project they've been put in place
before where people at them into the

123
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,009
people

124
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,939
and try to detect if a good tell lies
accurately in

125
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:34,870
Summit S one so accurate but pull that
when the morn us other than

126
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,810
they decide to really push the bounds at
this an interview lotta people but

127
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,439
really ask questions as to why

128
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,310
but people were successful or
unsuccessful what was going through

129
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,960
their mind

130
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,349
what signals with a rating with a
hearing an anime September 1991

131
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,960
is when the first published their
results which were gonna go for some

132
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,930
this so I found is

133
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,159
a wizard or that her mother was it will
be someone

134
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,110
that could the tet deception with an
actor Sid eighty percent

135
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,409
or more an interesting thing RCA tips
that is high

136
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:11,120
but most analysts can I detect deception
the fifty percent

137
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,709
with south of the law reassess little
going so and

138
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:20,209
not so much in Europe but the thing the
state's everyone has a polymorphism

139
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,229
of the use the polygraph for the
polygraph is only sometimes inaccurate

140
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:26,440
best when it is being accurate and
there's a seal the discussions are

141
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,099
people

142
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,289
you know knowing how to bypass a
polygraph the basically when they did

143
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,079
their testing

144
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,560
they got people from the secret service
the CIA

145
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,810
FBI an essay drug enforcement agency's

146
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,240
police judges but there was a college
students and just

147
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,740
averaged a public people live no
experience it into quite a stir for a

148
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,190
job

149
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,230
what initially found is that

150
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,620
I guess no surprise to some extent that
secret service agents performed better

151
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,440
than chance

152
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,899
so what does that mean really that means
that they will write more than 50

153
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:56,880
percent the time so

154
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
maybe they just got lucky but really

155
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,250
so in their first test they had formed a
nine people

156
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,690
said they found that the secret service
professionals seem to

157
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,790
be the best Risling have men and women
in the testing

158
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,610
and they found another field man or a
woman see what is no better than you

159
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,040
that

160
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,370
telling me a line really out all these
people are tested

161
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,579
only one percent those people were cost
is achieved with is that was only one

162
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,149
percent all those people tested

163
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,730
who constantly detect deception over
eighty percent

164
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,459
joint through the slides

165
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,790
later that the online but the saddest
details at how many people were

166
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,680
in the group to testing so those he is
seeing lie to me

167
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
I told you just a little bit about was
its who do you think

168
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,500
is it was it in this picture is it a.m.

169
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,149
to the imposter how Lightman nor

170
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,300
going the Polo or re a Taurus

171
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,779
noon exactly

172
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,630
this is the truth was it the helen is
actually

173
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,529
based ample that mean the guy that did
the trick was it so did his light one up

174
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:07,540
their technical

175
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,059
consultants on the show let's is color
with the president is he really knows

176
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,779
his stuff

177
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,000
so let's get hung up on I'm

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,380
he was thankful his yes this lady

179
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,689
is the chief was it in the shows are
suddenly got any formal training

180
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,630
originally

181
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,779
his clothes natural gift to detect
deception

182
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,900
and these people do really exists in
real life

183
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,110
so this lady goes by the name though its
allies I don't know why real name is

184
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,730
she doesn't like to tell people are
running is and this was a project when

185
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:38,980
on

186
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,529
for quite a few years even after they
published their results they carried on

187
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,470
set them or more people to try and test
their theories as he was part one other

188
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,760
witness protection around 2004

189
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,910
and she was like one other the truth
with its now she uses the skills to

190
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,130
detect deception

191
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,250
helping night judges and courts and the
police system

192
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,680
and so she really help give me some
information on the background as well as

193
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,430
was predicted headed with this product
for

194
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,850
an entity known yeah

195
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,160
and so there isn't really that much
information out there material at heart

196
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,600
so

197
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,750
see any some other from the documents
and stuff to rate router

198
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,779
to understand what they're trying to

199
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,510
so how do these SoCal truth with its

200
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,610
do it happen maybe one eighty percent
success all the time

201
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,720
to basically the Disco is natural
ability third

202
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,819
we understand sure how they do it but
when

203
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,520
he speaks and get feedback for use in a
variety of signals to spot deception

204
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,300
so they're not just look into their eyes
in easily NLP stuff that with

205
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,220
with briefly talk tonight about you know
what direction are either going at that

206
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,529
time

207
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,120
book is not worried about someone
scratched in there are also two tonight

208
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,130
is

209
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,910
base that is all the information but
they're listening to the word people are

210
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,480
saying

211
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,730
the language to turn RT and all the
different things

212
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,970
to base in the main thing but they say
they're looking for ways inconsistency

213
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,679
so if you look at term some other video
she does videos online and they're on

214
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,410
you cheap

215
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,970
so the video someone in a cool case she
basically tell you the process if she's

216
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,029
going through

217
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,390
to decide whether someone is being
deceptive so she's looking for someone

218
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,350
his emotion doesn't quite maps the
picture and as a really good one on

219
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,059
there about time

220
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:19,990
a lady who was accused of murdering a
children turns up to did murder children

221
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,459
but she was trying to say that someone
else today

222
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,510
and so it has been in Sicilia kinda
sorrowful

223
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,649
every time should finish been inserted
also to this comment quick mix while

224
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,140
officially have to leave again

225
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,819
basis is inconsistent what would happen
sell CC

226
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,410
if it shouldn't really have been
murdered by someone else national me

227
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,120
happy

228
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,990
buy anything so sorry the change the
body language but

229
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,829
by silicon have a red patents so that
they're looking at everything

230
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:53,100
so you may be thinking have you got the
skill inside yourself

231
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,550
as we said already everyone has a skill
with this girl

232
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,709
in a 50-50 toss it going but

233
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,029
you can get better the 50/50 if you want
is not

234
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,360
easy but that nothing's impossible so
you thinkin

235
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,740
under any chance to do in this city
study body language amok expressions

236
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,529
not you have to be let's see how this
natural is an ideal one percent in here

237
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,980
say bring them on me already which is
not difficult

238
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,660
and the base if you wanna trial studies
on this stuff that's a

239
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,760
you pretty be right to to a three-time
so

240
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,000
you can improve your odds now it is
gonna go through

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,240
body language and have live larger mines

242
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,779
I am so the most important thing the
body language ever with everything

243
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,829
is baseline everybody is completely
different

244
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:44,020
for this stuff is unlocks a high level
just the generic

245
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,480
kinda global stand as it were so
basically

246
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,679
if I talked about someone having a nope
Russell Brower something that doesn't

247
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:51,980
mean

248
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,480
a lying when you got here maybe it's
have a brown so

249
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,040
I see baselines really important that's
when the things when you're questioning

250
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,240
people trying to sleep you need feedback
you need to set up a sign

251
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,110
and then look for the variations in the
pattens

252
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,929
the first into a quick and do is very
brief look at my Chris russians

253
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,170
so who knows what mark expresses a

254
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,199
his hands thank to mark expresses
something that's very quick heads

255
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:24,190
micro and they say the happening like
123 for the second so the

256
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,459
very quick changes and I see happen at a
subconscious level so we really come

257
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:29,569
control

258
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,040
that we're doing this to let people a
facial tics or

259
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,839
that something is a little things that
happen a subconscious level

260
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,899
to basically when Ekman that his studies
he basically said that there are

261
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:46,000
607 basic expressions so happiness which

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,769
is on this picture but we've got sadness
anger contempt discussed

263
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,600
surprise and fear and bass is part of
his study

264
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,180
am the condom at all the muscles in
people's faces

265
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,329
and so if you do any of them Ackman's

266
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:05,420
well David Matsumoto it took about a
minute and his studies

267
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,579
that's the map the face a that tell you
that when someone showing anger it's

268
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:12,860
and three plus 24 equals this minus
something

269
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,529
not an come to the massive had basic

270
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,500
there's all these low key things that
yeah we can't control because a

271
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,209
something much is now face a happen

272
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:25,350
so quickly you know we can to try and
train a cell gets really this

273
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,730
we can look as much as best as I can
break quickly but

274
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,040
Marcus russians definitely not easy
answer to give all UHV you a taste the

275
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,129
what it looks like to the tech tomorrow
expression

276
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:39,370
in a moment but I'll see very quickly on
the screen

277
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,139
you're gonna see and five different Mike
expressions these a back from like the

278
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,190
80 so the

279
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,269
it is a bit funky they say you're gonna
see its mark expression

280
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,420
twice I was very quickly and

281
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,079
I want you to I make a mental note write
it down

282
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,230
decided that mark especially seeing you
seen sadness

283
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,470
anger surprise fear discussed contempt
for happiness

284
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,470
and then where the sea have successfully
a the everybody ready

285
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:25,259
easier

286
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,589
going

287
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,450
urgency happens really quick and

288
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,880
Rican if you look at the Knights there's
a quick link this is a free

289
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,079
tested and is one company management
trying here in time

290
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,030
say it's too but the answers so

291
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,069
the full this guy maybe have happiness
his hands

292
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:18,329
discussed

293
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,880
surprise anger

294
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,770
crack and that this was with this guy

295
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,570
a lovely lady

296
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,370
to what we see that was a surprise there
or contempt

297
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,520
happiness anger

298
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,140
and discussed it was discussed

299
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:50,270
this one

300
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,710
anger discussed

301
00:17:53,710 --> 00:18:00,710
surprise

302
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:07,799
the some happiness

303
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,899
is my favorite on third

304
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:13,730
surprise

305
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,160
anger discussed content

306
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,970
yeah the contempt is when these marks
questions to

307
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,239
seabees really was a very common the
last one

308
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:32,050
what this lady have discussed

309

fear surprise

311
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,300
yep that was surprise

312
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,590
so your interest in my expression so

313
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,050
let's say it's really difficult to try
and cover some stuff a little virgin see

314
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,290
it's not easy in some stuff that race
unless busty

315
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,290
came surprise very Cinemark expressions
but

316
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,440
the pool Ekman is getting a bit now but

317
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,030
you know he did some there is a stub
from the ground breaking stuff says

318
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,500
awesome

319
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,230
you learn from him this guy essays doing
some more today

320
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,240
cutting-edge modern and programs David

321
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,460
matsumoto he runs the ham intergroup and
they do some online training that

322
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,730
but decent prices such as well as up

323
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,929
flexed to a body language

324
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,790
an so as I said before Iceland's
important

325
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,179
I'm gonna go through the whole body
position look anything's isolation see

326
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,580
looking for changing pattern

327
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,600
and yet the past as an important site

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,450
but think take things at face value

329
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,350
but sees a talk about the face common
body language that you'll see that is

330
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,050
handy

331
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,700
an specify think the social engineering
but just things in general

332
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,780
some people contradict themselves to so

333
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,460
someone us tell you that they don't
wanna do something

334
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,630
so that is saying now than I don't
either but they're nodding in an

335
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,870
though with the body language is
completely country kitchen the word

336
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,820
essay saying I'm

337
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,059
you re sorry about that mean 9

338
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,640
but in a tree there sorry that's really
and

339
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,480
stone from head that's when the things I
still up full head

340
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,870
crinkly furrowed forehead so basically
someone else

341
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,210
you know got that that only someone it's
in a stressed

342
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,620
environment some it's not right so the
situation adding live

343
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,330
but where is what they're saying they're
feeling all their hearing

344
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,929
is given intention not concerned that
outing at if

345
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,480
you don't see this because nowadays we
have a tux

346
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,690
this could be recently in a senate
another one

347
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,900
a.m. Mason obvious but sweating

348
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,550
people that got let's what if people
have sweaty brows

349
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,000
policy when an with

350
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,540
highly stressed of IPL whether
uncontrollable thing where we swept

351
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,940
and source is a clear indicator that
whatever's happening

352
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,400
than a happy about the federal income to
about it again as far as important maybe

353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,610
it had a really hot curry

354
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,030
or maybe they have in america from some
who have medical problems where

355
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,780
they dispersed by all the time so again
as far as important to stand take

356
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,530
consolation

357
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,350
the obvious one identifiable but

358
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,410
is a footballer an and people are ready

359
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,770
pissed off and angry they have the
temporal vein in UConn

360
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,360
bowed out the head so some neighbors
more from on that's good things look at

361
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,390
4°c this guy's got

362
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,790
really problem from them probing for
invading

363
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,200
sounds wrong an another common thing to
see

364
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,150
kinda all through the body is condo
hiding or shooting a self

365
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,010
the situation so every be a.m. I said
but he say

366
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,960
feet in cement a willful they said we'll
have a motor thinking

367
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,060
CO ever a visual person an ordinary
person

368
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,060
work in a static persons that's like
feeling emotional

369
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,940
to depend on that that to a person you
are when hearing stuff

370
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,840
or you're in a confrontational situation
this is when you gonna shield yourself

371
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,190
as also getting indicator an at that
motor thinking

372
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,720
nice simple we're trying to play someone
this is someone's really visual when

373
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,040
you're talking to them about and I

374
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,280
if you to hear this so and I said that
he will be accepted as much

375
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,500
critics paintings visually so

376
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,230
tool in the eyes people say the eyes

377
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,970
you know the key to the soul in in some
ways to write but the eyes

378
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,250
assuming that when people talk about
body language interception people

379
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,679
now about the eyes because I think them
me that's what he's been the media most

380
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,380
especially

381
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,559
and the last so 10-15 years was an L PZ
more popular

382
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,800
they did a lot talking about the eyes or
to mention a minute so

383
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,140
but you think about what about it
section it wasn't that the eyes

384
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,290
eyebrows really important

385
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,860
an and this is on it as well as much
expressions that

386
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,740
when you see people's an I wrestled a
gun in college and one eyebrow

387
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,260
so a look this is a.m. someone where
their the ready

388
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,590
pissed off or disliking the situation is
going on the train to control themselves

389
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,100
there it is quite clear and eyebrows the

390
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,419
place that some he said if you live in
OP but is familiar with them

391
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,460
the NLP the eyes

392
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,540
plans fact so they say there's a lot of
study and

393
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,030
is I'd say ninety percent Acura and
that's in

394
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,370
interrogation rooms people use this so
this model quite a lot

395
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,890
and even as i said i zonked out at
everything when it

396
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,070
assessing people's body language it's
always good to check the eyes just to

397
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,179
see if the

398
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:38,400
matching with every house is going on
but one important thing about this

399
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,169
to basically I said let my son important
so if you tryna

400
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:45,230
are some questions because everyone's
different them

401
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,060
ninety percent of people because with
the left and a right-handed batters in a

402
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,840
minute

403
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,010
you are gonna look in the same so way so
when

404
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,850
you're looking at someone you know the
girl look up and to the right

405
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,110
when they actually remembering something
when they're trying to

406
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,380
and I imagine it'll make some Cup on the
spot there and look up to left

407
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,770
again is where the mods the thinking
comes important because if your visual

408
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,500
person

409
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,330
and OC Emulex's the visualization so far

410
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,140
just lookin horizontal was your trip up
and emotional

411
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,570
in a static stuff happens down below am

412
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,610
the reason base was a porn is because
everyone is in the same 30 have this

413
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,669
balloon mode operation okay if I tell
someone Osama something a little left

414
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:27,870
the difficult lying

415
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,230
well perhaps they reversed so some
left-handed people

416
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,919
you know they there the way the brain
works means a riverside

417
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,890
I sizable saw some questions you know
the obvious answer to

418
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,909
so you can understand a baseline the
thing that's a

419
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:46,350
really important in the eyes the

420
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,810
an is people dilation so happy in with
content

421
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,280
a people's daylight like this

422
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,530
and I missing something to wear

423
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,390
if a prolific mean danger they constrict
to try and focus on the situations when

424
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,669
you're talking to someone

425
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,890
about something and they're trying to
deny if they're really clearly focused

426
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:06,510
on the real

427
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,540
the kinda zoned out it's pretty accurate
that what you're talking about

428
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,530
than a happy about you mentioned before

429
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,550
especially someone is a visual person if
you're talking to someone

430
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,659
about the illusion of showing them you
know that they're gonna possibly cover

431
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:23,640
their eyes not

432
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,790
I'll see is obvious that this but you
may see them come again I'll

433
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:32,240
you now is a long time ago in a Comedy
remember what was thinking about

434
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,000
another thing with the eyes but i think
is a a general misconception is that

435
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,890
people think

436
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,210
when I'm lying or yet so I'm lying when
I China

437
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,250
attendant on the truth and I give you I
i 100 percent

438
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,000
I contact so I must retain the chief
this nap I'll I will have to look at you

439
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,190
threaten the face when realities

440
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,840
that's opposite thing happens on the
arts and the chief you know

441
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,010
not to staring people are freaking out
stands there I sent

442
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,490
as one and eyes

443
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,750
the NYS is important as well the the
nose Creek in with with took it a bit

444
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,750
later

445
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,720
and miss the kids get off their mark
expressions and body language is

446
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,480
you know they haven't learnt that its
that the tell lies in Tron

447
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,200
the skies things as much easier to learn
their body language the most contain

448
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,860
isn't in the clear sign of displeasure
as unhappy or perhaps a

449
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,320
stressed the touching

450
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,380
grabbing a the night is that something
people do pacification

451
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,659
and maybe if an

452
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:42,060
there can set it up emotional person
maybe it also that

453
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,800
they can smell the bullshit talk about

454
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,630
another one as poss prices example this

455
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,770
is people that think they've got the
upper hand all the more security will

456
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,900
have that kind have

457
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,260
a call about the the snow tonight is in
a walk round be a

458
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,730
as a band that the thing about in the
house basis a sign in and I feel that

459
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,070
they're super confident

460
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,830
so many times up that so a person and
basically the opposite happens they

461
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,800
start looking down

462
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,169
not a clear sign up see what your
discussion with them

463
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:15,240
in another game where it's and

464
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,370
nothing just to lift up because I
interest in magic in

465
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:23,900
that so then ELISA C and sanction like
people do so consciously

466
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,910
30 you just a simple meditate liked I
guess we're calling

467
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,230
is someone's hand the direction their
nose as was I sniff out the truth

468
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,750
that could actually be the the hand the
clinton say try that

469
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:40,080
and people trying chicky let's see what
about his mouth

470
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,000
an when people are already stressed a
concern that this compressed

471
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,600
pursed lips look about themselves so you
know that kinda tana

472
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,590
hold in the thing they're doing another
one

473
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,910
again the blocking for the covering the
mouth so much like

474
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,630
they that honest stop themselves it
initially they don't want their

475
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,740
it escaped nothing

476
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,940
similar with in a rubbing the nose is
biting the lip

477
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,040
this again is another pacification
situation

478
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,740
so when people there stressed all
concerned they may do this

479
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,370
am people so looking licking their lips
ESO thing

480
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,440
course I sizable perhaps as got really
dry lips

481
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,490
another thing about the lips is an

482
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,570
it's very difficult to tell maturity
close but I lips at sea change size

483
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,809
and based on emotions which brings in
the time so merrily

484
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,179
happy and come to a situation we have
like bill big full

485
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,750
flip to us like I am and generally

486
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,950
in tight lips and you'll see those
reduce lightly when they're

487
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,970
stand get stressed all a high-tension
nothing is really important

488
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,090
a.m. is a smile a.m.

489
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,240
so if you do some more research to mark
special you'll see that basically when

490
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,550
week give a real smile

491
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,640
other things happen with her eyes like
that you know the crow's feet again

492
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,200
people about auctioning this is
obviously but when someone's trying to

493
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,350
tell you the happy or the conference and
as saying or trying to save you

494
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,050
in an I'll see a fake smile is a dead
giveaway that they're trying to pull the

495
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,770
wool over your eyes

496
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,250
is

497
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,260
am is don't really have a lot to tell
you're saying that for listening

498
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,540
an but one thing you do see again is
people are up there is

499
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,700
and the pacification and this is
actually something that

500
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,210
I wasn't aware until I to reveal myself
and I was doing

501
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,780
and summits research and testing other
people the best when I'm in a situation

502
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,420
at this company stress

503
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,260
I love my ear and so this means that
somebody that's why I'm reading the

504
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,929
Bahamian that pressure points

505
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,260
and around here the pups on past find
myself that way so

506
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,800
history my ear in on the break into

507
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,160
at the neck annex also

508
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,640
a.m. quiet a good indicator for us a.m.

509
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,000
when I've done some this research to
find that women's into

510
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,730
the morn outspokenness and his body
temperature and things which

511
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,660
not because today analyses a good
example people's emotions

512
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,630
but you'll find that in high-stress
situations people

513
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,060
you know rubbing touching the nectar
again to pass by themselves

514
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,270
and I also can't sometimes be
accompanied by a watching

515
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,540
the skin and when I really stressed in
China

516
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,480
act calmly another the might say

517
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,050
is people kind of stretching and
irritate the net trying to relieve

518
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,340
stress is a natural thing

519
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,080
the tragedy but they tryin ma sis been
about messing with the caller also like

520
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,429
this

521
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:39,220
and to trying to see this neck tilting

522
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,040
a is another really important and
peaceable and specifi it on a minute let

523
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,679
someone

524
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,650
who his guide dog

525
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,060
I get there with me so they ever had it
when you talk dirty dog

526
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,390
and for that some reason you really
think they understand what you're saying

527
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,130
they do that

528
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,410
had to anything like but after all and
services already a Siemens

529
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,130
so when at Tilden said i sat there
really interactive what you're saying

530
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,520
so again if this changes you know that
one-year lease in addition gauging so

531
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,010
from nm

532
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,530
manipulation perspective cue track
events on it but some

533
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,710
slight head tilting really important am

534
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,960
but thats this is kinda como more
relaxed tilting

535
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,560
BC when it becomes a.m. more rigid

536
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,870
base is a good indicator that that the
stress though

537
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,240
in a stock it really uncomfortable about
it and sometimes even see it so much

538
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,920
that can alert

539
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,930
in ways that frozen and not let my

540
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,170
a shit to set their own think an

541
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,230
the basis for that rabbit in the
headlights type a thing with them

542
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,160
an interesting one I love likes

543
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,430
and so legs again basie when she starts
get passed away so

544
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,500
some other stuff that we spoke about
already I'm sure most the

545
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,100
kinda myself that was obvious well in
agony about the eyes or

546
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,770
and I will Cooper be it had to pass
haitian something but even though the

547
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,550
of this it will happen a subconscious
level and you know you can see when your

548
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,190
hands a

549
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,510
we go around or he might realize after
that that you know you're you crabby and

550
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,130
eyes but

551
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:14,660
consciously am when it gets below the
waist we kind of

552
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,570
don't really think about the body
language is happening down below not the

553
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,690
reason for that being the

554
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,660
in only with sat down behind a desk or
behind a podium

555
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,070
am so we don't even think about the body
language that help lower body is off

556
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,050
the facts this is really poor body
language that we can use to give us even

557
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,930
more information

558
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,550
so well things obviously

559
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,130
is sometimes they of this is a by
example is I had trouble finding

560
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,840
on some pitches this stuff a.m. bases
when people

561
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,120
grabbing their knees either try to come
from cells almost restrain themselves

562
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,650
can also he seats on the set down and my
sis interviews

563
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,050
it with you into being in places like
when they start to get an

564
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,870
been come to a perhaps about the
questions you ask them in challenging

565
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,200
them

566
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,390
on puppies experience she seemed kinda
out themselves by and they wanna skate

567
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,710
but

568
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,400
account am

569
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,540
here again I sizable not to women

570
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,850
for obvious reasons though in a skirt
may sit with the last post:

571
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,580
base they when where when they're ready
Compton

572
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,780
we will you know sit or stand know the
legs akimbo

573
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,090
and when you start to see that change

574
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,750
assist on to lack confidence so if you
were ask people questions and I like

575
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,530
am and this is cool I'm not worried and
i kind if you start the

576
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,720
pressure them but they're 10 hours he
stays the same and I think but there is

577
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,900
a close in the United

578
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,270
you put them under pressure crossed legs
again

579
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,690
and I'm into a lot for obvious reasons
and the basically this is a clear

580
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,120
example body language

581
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,940
an effin AB kaisa interestingly enough
to pick up artist or something

582
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,260
a.m. some other training you get for
that I am

583
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,560
they say let the across the legs is
perhaps a barrier so you can touch it

584
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,530
and it's just in politic based on

585
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:03,660
which weighs a a letter saying and the
basis assign

586
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,550
that may be there fearful and the try
again if the trial come for themselves

587
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,490
type situation

588
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,550
I mention this earlier but this one is
really well things I

589
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,590
I use most the time when you try a
minute later or

590
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,710
a.m. influence someone basically

591
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,240
is like an animalistic instinct that
basically to be confident

592
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,730
or them to be more authoritative special
man but

593
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,470
everyone which we try and take as much
time as possible your CC let me try and

594
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,889
the club

595
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,020
nine is about china to the door is
locked in a not when possibly because

596
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,950
and I'm really big especially when
you're tryna minute by someone you can

597
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,370
use that you've on to say no just have
your Lex place like more on them or

598
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,710
if we're trying it less time to in a bow
down to a wedding

599
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,850
you see the latest at the close up so
this is a

600
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,500
a clear way to the to say that in Asia
China interact with someone if they

601
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,600
think they're ready dominant

602
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,950
in a high after handle it policy and
legs a closing

603
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,370
you know this time to win or they can
fearful am

604
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,680
another thing the OC when this is
slightly different assist someone

605
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,160
standing cross like that's how they
normally stand

606
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,280
or less than a minute this Lex playing
a.m.

607
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,900
reaction is that by of light and
Tennessee the

608
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:20,220
getting ready to the Dutch of now it's
ok with perfect

609
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,150
the fate a.m. turnovr in with a mention
the moment and his

610
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,170
been in his book some really good stuff
on the fake and I never really

611
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,440
notice before Intel I read his book and
start watching people on

612
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,440
is that's the right so

613
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,950
basically people yet he said he would
happen FA

614
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,530
I can be a sign that Heather and a high
stress environment

615
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,010
or maybe they decide to take the fate
again baseline important

616
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,240
but when assume people to sign up and
they fill

617
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,120
restricted or under pressure to see them
tryna start to close in so they will

618
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,420
know that the in

619
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,570
but this into the chair to try income
for themselves

620
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,780
when they're really breaking it then
then the Staatsoper

621
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,520
locked their fee into the chair again
they really want to be rooted in secure

622
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,750
and services to see them suffering back
thoroughfare of the

623
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,160
where i think is really interesting and
addition to recommend that

624
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,390
you to trust and he went right to people
here later

625
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,520
and then there you see with Assange not
be that vince's talk

626
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,990
that they see the direction our feet
arian can really tell us a lot

627
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,320
so when where property in truck to
someone at

628
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,740
even if you're in a rush and we fully
commit to someone normally withstand

629
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,080
night body to body had to say

630
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,780
but then if either we don't know what's
happening or we may be running late for

631
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,500
something

632
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,700
you'll see that the change yeah so I
might be really happy to be here

633
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,410
the seamy kinda sunless base what's
happening it's a constant thing and i

634
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,250
really wanna get out the situation

635
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,880
and the way my for is pointing to the
door there

636
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,610
has a clear indication that our strike
out at all soon as possible

637
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,760
nothing else even people uncomfortable I
call it the the childlike

638
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,220
that thing where the Figo in you can
measure could do nicolette

639
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,350
a shekel again anthers the comment thing
thirty think that we are speaking to

640
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,660
people

641
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,980
a.m. it's not so much about can easily
detect deception stuff

642
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,080
amber as much as building report so when
you're speaking to someone

643
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,320
I am industry on a gonna be friendly
with them

644
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,520
it might be that the you start to lose
them when you see that the guy might be

645
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,240
not because to put them under pressure
or they want to be rude but you know

646
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,020
they're running late

647
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,359
so it can help to build report to
recognize that sell now ready think

648
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,540
appreciably in a hurry said I let you go

649
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,030
less important hands

650
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,220
and still are talking again some other
stuff but idk obvious we see our hands

651
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,540
move around all the time buzzing

652
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,770
I stressed environment you know when a
player handout this is why

653
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:01,480
I've got hardly any hair the Sun pretty
stressed at work

654
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,060
nothing again you see a lot when people
are ready come from his summit the Lex

655
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,480
playing they're trying to take up as
much as possible

656
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,910
one other things that term when it comes
the hands

657
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,950
you might say is again this isn't for
everybody the Summer Sun that this left

658
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,580
thumbs

659
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,550
appoint backwards they can be a sign a
happy said the disgruntled about

660
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,250
situational what's being discussed

661
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,600
on the opposite being if they're
standing over the thumbs pointing

662
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,830
forward that can be

663
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,330
a sign that they're curious so confused
about what's happening so just a small

664
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,340
things

665
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,950
can in a given indications what's
happening in a mentally

666
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,560
hands they playing this is a common
thing when people but Russia

667
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,050
how confident and dominant they are when
you see this change

668
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,609
because the interlocking this again is a
sin

669
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:50,940
took a pass for k sitting there looking
down we see the stapling

670
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,230
in a may say about this for me to see a
couple i think is

671
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,620
but I still means the same thing when
the communicating to people when I body

672
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,130
language

673
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,310
you know looks at the ready is over
eighty percent it

674
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,270
and when the open and honest and trucks
in me we only have always someone will

675
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,260
have up arms up

676
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,620
open in a non threatening way you know
he can but my wrists

677
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,640
unity of listen to the talk

678
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,890
all on the train to be am more dominant
we don't wanna be that we don't discuss

679
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,690
anything

680
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,070
no one ever hands down very
authoritative a dictated

681
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,560
and the same thing goes for Hans and one
on the table

682
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,450
or on a podium at this so if someone was
looking really compliment you know they

683
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,580
were just holding

684
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,359
by the side does it show they're fairly
confident but maybe if they got their

685
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:39,230
hands by trypan again the traffic up
much space

686
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,640
as possible to look really confident

687
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,160
nothing about the hands I want people
standing in a china

688
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,210
try be really cool you may notice that
like in this picture here

689
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,620
the guys guys funds on display as
opposed to inside

690
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,850
measure the funds out is a clear sunny
skies really confident is really a

691
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,960
certain confidence self

692
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,510
what we tend to either for some reason I
don't know what's the funds but

693
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,700
we hide our fans we feel threatened the
or find ourselves in a situation not

694
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,560
sure about

695
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,040
so again I sizable because in a maybe

696
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,980
that is how you stand doesn't mean that
you're in a compliment your crop

697
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,730
yourself

698
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,930
that's what I sizable and so 20 where
their

699
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,570
thing is an

700
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,760
news report again this is a matter is
hooked up before ventilation so

701
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,900
again the reason why a man had some
pretty with my hands

702
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,800
my fingers through my head all the time
basically when less stressed so

703
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,840
concerned about 4 under pressure

704
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,770
is something you'll see going back to
picking up chicks

705
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:46,070
a.m. it's another thing that when it can
be also

706
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,430
a sign in a good mood you know when
we're tool in with a hair wrap around I

707
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,350
think ur

708
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:55,940
an as a base the it shines that we're
positive trying a positive signal so

709
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,080
when you travel a

710
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,430
local and his lawyer yeah i think is
really cute and

711
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,470
the its when a

712
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,870
bottom I favorite ones that you will see
a lot a.m.

713
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,500
I'd say Lauren in meetings and stuff but
people sat down

714
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,770
the basic they relieving it United

715
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:20,130
like Rockies OC not impressed thing and
I meet in the summer sunny Singh elect

716
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,609
for he had a really condition that
you're saying you may find that

717
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,210
night and realizing you know you're
stuck there we may be adjusted glasses

718
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,070
will

719
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:32,480
a something so in a subconsciously you
don't really realize a

720
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,470
overtly doing it but this is a clear
sign that and I'm someone's not happy in

721
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,589
when the itching wanna watch what they
do in the thing that you like this I

722
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:40,120
like

723
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,200
ni to contain

724
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,550
arms arms don't really have a

725
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:52,100
a great deal to tell us and that similar
to the Lex playing

726
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:57,040
and this year any get you guys interest
in poker plays poker

727
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,349
and the Irish guys in an

728
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:04,390
turnovr again and his one of the experts
on body language and his

729
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,790
written a book just completely dedicated
to to poke a plane stuff

730
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:11,869
so they discover pits therefore a good
example so this guy a subsea

731
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:15,569
plays poker face on well you can tell
about him

732
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:19,560
I said before the next play but this
time with the arms is his arms are quite

733
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,260
close in his protest himself

734
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,460
so in a striped ETA blocking stuff now
so world

735
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,190
to really is not that confident about
the handle the movie is about the plate

736
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,560
where's is gonna hand super confident

737
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,130
they have not tourism to relieve
positive for seven strong

738
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,200
real strong possible was about to happen
so isn't the only negative feelings or

739
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,700
fear or concern about us that to happen
shoulders

740
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,040
other showed is a very similar to market
specialist this year and look at the

741
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,869
lights light

742
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:53,050
changes in the shoulders and this is
comic

743
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,119
a good example the pitch it is not so
clear but you can see this lady

744
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:00,369
her one showed a slightly tilted bases
this is

745
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,490
AST a sign of insecurity lacking
confidence

746
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,430
so if we as being the someone you kinda
see just a slight and a change

747
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,030
could be a sign a sign to accomplish and
what you're talking about

748
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,710
this one we've all seen me unlike a shit
like

749
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,430
it all just wanna retracting his self
and so that showed a striking thing is

750
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,260
the clear thing about

751
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,460
I don't know maybe if just made a
mistake or that's information

752
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,569
little night the a sale as well is this
then

753
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:31,869
shoulder rubbing again it's a
pacification think but you also see if

754
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:33,180
the company normally buy

755
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,550
in the crossing over see that kind of
specialists when it feels weird but and

756
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,990
in a a crisis up also blocking self into
what's happening as well

757
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,280
because kahan things

758
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,339
abscesses runnable so that's what we're
looking at torso

759
00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:53,040
so in a I cast my whole body with you
know we consider this to be the main

760
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,780
other body

761
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,490
not something that term is really
important as well may communicate with

762
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:57,990
people

763
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,780
so much that already with the fate but
basically when where confident and being

764
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,359
open our eyes to someone when in fact
went through with them

765
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:08,380
you know we can have our bodies face on
what side to side

766
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,780
this is neglected to kiss the how the
woman

767
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,160
a.m. is holding the books but with Matt
and I was based on there but

768
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,730
on my footing stress to me the company
ourselves you know where

769
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:22,270
where blockhouse else whether and I so
we've seen all the time then people on

770
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,050
popular it pissed off either how to buy
in front in a min

771
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,690
issue at the bar last night you can see
a couple people allocations

772
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,050
kiss them there was some strange things
going on so I think they're pretty that

773
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:33,440
word

774
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,930
and another thing again similar

775
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,869
you're protecting yourself but medicine
sometimes become possessive sat down

776
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:45,869
at work on a rocking motion and how
accurate is but apparently they a.m.

777
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:50,770
it some studies on bears the VIN kept in
captivity for tricks and things and

778
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,530
you'll see that

779
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,670
lease bears that is rocking think
apparently it releases serotonin a

780
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,490
summit to help the stress so maybe

781
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,170
this is what we're doing and leaning in

782
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,400
the this is a bitch last night because

783
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,040
an the best when we really engage in
interest in someone with aniline into

784
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,859
the net so

785
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:13,060
different cultures a.m. with took

786
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,480
very quickly approx an ex-con few
minutes left a.m. but

787
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,990
basically you know how close we are
learning certain someone is really

788
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,880
important so

789
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,020
just wrap up as I mentioned before

790
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,109
it's really easy to read I'm not gonna
recommend you go will they start looking

791
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,079
at kids KORS

792
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:32,829
I get in trouble but I think it's fair
to everyone here and I will be

793
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:34,380
interesting body language or not

794
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,640
this guy is not happy think he up is
chocolate take items like

795
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,119
but the important thing and especially

796
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,780
this now I'm ENGLISH in some use wesun
Spanish a little things

797
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,069
a.m. their body language it is a global
thing

798
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,339
as much about the high-level but lawn is
a general stuff with the

799
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:55,530
but basically need to be really aware
have both

800
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,550
the just as you do this the just as you
give of a look at other people's body

801
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,119
language

802
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,310
but you have to keep things into context
and

803
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,050
so in the UK and America this is good is
an ass

804
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:10,960
and but had two Italian in person that
Mon Ami a good thing that might be

805
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,640
number one

806
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,579
and in Japan apparent that means than
the five known from grace

807
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,010
product means abuse 60

808
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,579
now you have to have you might be why I
had a good time hour hockey

809
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,930
again another thing

810
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,619
and to me that means okay but to someone
in Japan that

811
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:33,760
is not OK at zero happened to anything
a.m.

812
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,609
apparently any people a Turkish a
bazillion people here

813
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:41,740
night the history behind us in so

814
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,030
as well so but

815
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,339
am as a lot this last night and

816
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:51,540
but no rocking on is really good for us
a but

817
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,960
only finitely that's a really something
you have to stay in jail for the night

818
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,770
so

819
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,549
again turning point in mind for what's
happening and the jess is your given of

820
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,780
the show was my leg get UN

821
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,589
some member when you're interrupting the
people you want to be open honest

822
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,440
the palms up iraq is people of

823
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,549
hands down and again resourcefulness

824
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:16,609
last night and people get him a drink
soon as poking

825
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:20,240
gesture not place with polka nasa
addition think

826
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,109
bases like a form into it intimidation
says I'm going down too well

827
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:28,390
so if you just as some other stuff and
learn more about body language

828
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,920
to Navarro 110 percent recommend his
stuff

829
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,990
he's got lotsa books and he is the the
FBI agent

830
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,069
FBI agent the religious things

831
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:41,880
at Robert Phipps Mark Bowden and I
haven't read as much as their stuff

832
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:48,200
this you know my opinion jericho as much
as different as was on about

833
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,609
can week briefly mention process mix
this is gonna be this is like the

834
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:52,609
western gate

835
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:55,770
by swinging wrapped in with people try
me play with them

836
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:59,049
need to be aware of you know based on
where you are a personal issue based on

837
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:00,520
them

838
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,250
through quickly deception to know what
is deceptive

839
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,220
so basically other get really lucky ago
as he looks such a great tits

840
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:15,230
an anti-tax a bar of the set to the code
at the Shepherd's by round up and put in

841
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:15,890
the right direction

842
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:20,230
and suppressing it happy is the stuff to
see people

843
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,599
so basically if you can understand the
body language when you tryna

844
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,299
minutes late summer deceive them you can
see when things start a wrong

845
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:30,700
so you know if the headstones all all
good but then I such a lot

846
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,960
nothing is make now this was really
important

847
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,400
and I have ago two minutes cool

848
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,510
hear from I am peace talks about
medicare trying to some

849
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,559
trickery to prove a point so we can try
this now so

850
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,730
real quick the show you the cards and
the deal the cards on the table

851
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,619
22 concentrate on the cards and dealing
follow my instructions

852
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:57,829
for Nadu the cost down

853
00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:00,869
which almost 29 in the hell you are but
cards

854
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:07,869
and your red cards how many more red
card so I put down

855
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,980
15 cards it was a difficult he saw that
message

856
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:32,270
you want to because we didn't see the
messages time

857
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:39,270
to the folks on the spit focus on the
the in my hand

858
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,350
plan to prepare is that in a few think
body language just the eyes adjust to

859
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,110
feel something you concentrate 100
percent on that

860
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:58,330
you're gonna miss all these are
important stuff the massively penetrates

861
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,510
the country in cells ap

862
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:03,340
so look closer go out watch people

863
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,730
look at everything at a time that

864
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:13,730
any questions comments could that

865
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:21,010
how hard is it is it possible to learn
how to

866
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,609
have your micro movements mismatch what
you would normally do

867
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:29,190
I guess that would be very interesting
for poker players at at say

868
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,279
but general body language I think you
can be

869
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,640
quite good height now catching a self at
the time but the market expression stuff

870
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,099
this has happened but really a
subconscious level I think you can hide

871
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:40,690
it but

872
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,140
I think the problem is that people's
very difficult be that good at seeing it

873
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,309
so I can content I can see that muscle
that I want is easy but

874
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:51,369
is one some from the scene so you might

875
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:54,809
kinda religious and again but then her
up but

876
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:57,950
nigga but if you the

877
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,609
use other micro expressions and throwing
away all the time

878
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:05,599
yeah my be able to disguise yet again
assists this web in a van to say if

879
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,089
you're

880
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:10,089
if you can was when you know you're
lying answer given of those that saw the

881
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:11,039
body language it might

882
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,369
into it in a you do the things that make
you look more confident and

883
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:19,490
truck trying to see people min

884
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,450
cook thank you much
