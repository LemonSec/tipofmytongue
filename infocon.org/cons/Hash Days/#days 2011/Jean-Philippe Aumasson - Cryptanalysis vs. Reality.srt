1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,540
gonna pick your program

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,250
coming to my toe cretaceous versus

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,219
rarity

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,500
in let me start though

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,720
proposes purity maybe you all have an
idea of what it is but me

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,489
you from the debate commission's to
companies that

7
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,820
the study of measures for obtaining the
meaning of

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,629
encrypt that information without access
to the secret information that is

9
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:36,269
normally

10
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,949
we got to do so but the bigoted ideas
the key

11
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,159
but us to this definition is a bit nor a
bit restrictive

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,059
for another broken heart much different
goals done the group thing

13
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,080
are governed recovering dickey in part
to go in there is no cure dole

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,750
that's why we have much better defense
and on this one

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,989
so one considered big

16
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,720
former parliament gonna skip the
naughtiest is to buy that one of several

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,839
security notions

18
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,369
forgotten but claim implicitly or
explicitly dissatisfied is notions

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,540
there's really much better definition
you can

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,170
see for example of function to go up
another can be to find equation for

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,939
possible Shin

22
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,440
in because you have no key not ago can
be to Fortune a valid

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,240
mock for H Mart for example medical

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,210
would be to impersonate a user
interaction protocol okay

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,800
be now got to tour it directed us to the
state of

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,979
of things are doctor D exist

27
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,560
not are you gun utilize all B&M

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,870
yet %uh seniority is quite complex when
we make decisions in our lives who have

29
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,350
to

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,530
simplify things we got go to do all the
consequences of our actions we cannot

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,549
consider all the Prometheus so
implicitly

32
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,820
we simplify ready and does what could I
stop doing

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,090
we simplify ritee we create models with
motor switch

34
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,140
arduous much much go objects that's a

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,159
what did occur is allowed and not
allowed to do

36
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,120
what we assume that get a grip Canon can
do that is just

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,010
from away of thing this with North

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,790
something a productive is shown just
what we need to do could only this

39
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,900
and it would be go pick impossible to do

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,790
sawyer's could benefit squawk weed out
actually is modern

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,959
but you probably know tomatoes

42
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,750
exclude the attack to target the user
instead of the crypto

43
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,690
this includes for example bribery
coercion Burberry

44
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,410
dogging social engineering I don't cure
them to produce

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,830
book beneath are quite effective quite
powerful

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,120
but that's not the point of good eyes is
the but have to buy this

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,890
is the crypto gay it doesn't mean that
prepared the connected for me from

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,430
reality

49
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,310
it means that the point of good stories
cabeza just crypto

50
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,410
key so good as it used to be

51
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,880
directly connected to reality what you
see in the background is a machine

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,599
got the bomb that was constructed by are
entering his colleagues in nineteen

53
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,280
39 and it was used to the crypt

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,660
their communication for the Germans
during World War Two

55
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,650
I couldn't find a better example of good
done is connected to reality

56
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,830
that was during world war 2 now

57
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,260
to go back to doesn't live in thief

58
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,760
of really change so it's likely to dig
deeper streep

59
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,680
an iDEN hover what it would say they're

60
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,019
I use Russian marching to be tolerated

61
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,160
he's our son is being we sure on the
Registrar option function

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,660
I didn't really make this up you can
refine this kind of

63
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,950
statement in state-of-the-art research
papers if you don't believe me

64
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,160
me show you some examples of a recent
research

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,379
to cuff examples of same you free start
nicole is no docs

66
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,400
mode the coalition distinguish ur3 dated
yet doc

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,019
so though blah blah blah ring
distinguish your own

68
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,659
34 rounds apps doesn't connect them

69
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,400
okay

70
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,310
is better okay be to have things like

71
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,030
berman distinguish us with this
completely insane complexity

72
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,599
known rated you distinguish urs known
key

73
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:35,150
indicate supposed to be secret doesn't
make sense so

74
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,760
when people who are not into this kind
of thing to read this

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,320
defended some split it into you think
urban is cracked or other cipher force

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,850
ha cures cracking down a degree from
registered I don't to hear we

77
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,389
we have a problem but the problem is
does not if what is broken in the model

78
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,100
is known this already broken into
reality why do we publish the tuition

79
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,229
what other than the 2.2 we use the same

80
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,729
language we use the same what we use the
words at doc

81
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,290
broken and in the world of models

82
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,639
broken doesn't mean broken in reality so

83
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,380
Oscar Denise our the epidemic people
maybe we

84
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,210
to say to ourselves maybe we love
connection read it was Realty

85
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,240
do or more does make sense doesn't make
sense to do good night is at all

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,259
cause if you the people who do we will
stop like been bursting

87
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,570
it up crypto refuted by bust not

88
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,040
something to what that said I show me a
with a good book i

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,040
any recognize this so lead to reduce the
sewer lines

90
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,310
be you finish it by saying dahmer simple
ways of protecting the security system

91
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,870
gun or to my initials BD athani to

92
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,540
an employee and you're done okay

93
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,540
so this do the question is could both
relevant at all

94
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,479
doesn't make sense to spend dime in orgy
in money

95
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,699
attempting to break fight for us where

96
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,650
when nobody cares after all that the
beating provocative question

97
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,810
that's what I would like to to enter
into stock I'll

98
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,070
start by a brief you talking about
physical attacks

99
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,229
on the creeping up on the people then
the main but a bit awkward be

100
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,289
a grenade attacks own make your brief

101
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,020
state of the art and the security of so
for that we all know

102
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,080
I will give you five reasons why the
attacks that

103
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,389
you here but continues our in literature
or not

104
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,710
miss 38 bucks in the real world they
don't

105
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,680
talk about them human fucked or the
committed by simply

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,979
before saying if you was about yes

107
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,900
safer that we all know and we will use
every day

108
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,590
okay be so physical attacks

109
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,690
so you know if you your favorite
internet browser

110
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,449
you good in the nation to DPS website
Hodes little abutment

111
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,479
that you are perfectly secure but this
youth

112
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,669
for example Arissa cryptography with
2040 bits

113
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:17,600
of modest does not deliver secure
security level of security of

114
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,350
this modest size is approximately 100
beats

115
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,699
means that if you were to advocacy

116
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,009
it would take approximately two to do
100 operations

117
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,110
tube rigorously by factoring to
modernise

118
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,669
I don't know the details by saying what
an abortion is but you get the idea

119
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,259
but this is if you see both to this
computer

120
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,310
now the question can we do better on
this

121
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,919
as per first option is to use a quantum
computer it would pick

122
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,500
only 22 33 operations using

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,630
troughs algorithm the good news or bad
news

124
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,870
it up we don't know how to become
computers we don't even know if it's

125
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,300
physically possible the concert but I'm
computers

126
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,410
the thing about I don't tentative our
canoe

127
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,569
package DBS faster than the quantum
computer

128
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,110
what you can just go for my certificate
authority

129
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,300
and that much more powerful do does your
operations

130
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,990
so what you see here say an excerpt from
Iraq certificated

131
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,080
I was issued to go by deductions or its

132
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,509
that's the year DigiNotar you probably
don't know the story

133
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,639
and it was not issued on-the-record ago
but

134
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,759
a pretty high current to read the system
of did you know that our

135
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,909
and even though he didn't harp

136
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,980
the after private key he had the power
to

137
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,970
create certificates eight what I should
be used by the Iranian government

138
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,129
to spy on its citizens to remind the
middle tax

139
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:57,379
but if you see this addicted to you
someone

140
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,889
the use arson group in read to be strong
cryptography

141
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,989
but it was a bit the crew us what I've
been

142
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:08,019
shop 512 all our assay with

143
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,449
sixteen billion for beats it wouldn't
have changed anything

144
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,929
because the crypto was completely
bypassed yet Oct

145
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,209
didn't care but the group that I was
used

146
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,869
another example offered by bus what
happened last year to do

147
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:26,309
secure products secure USB Drive making
stance on this can

148
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:30,360
for but im to the way refutes 142
certified

149
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,239
the US a synchrotron with 256 bit of
security

150
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:39,269
but to the crib it out in the drive you
the bus for

151
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:43,209
and the problem is that they made a very
stupid reflection on the bus what it was

152
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,300
made in doing the hospice E and when the
bus was correct

153
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,300
BBC was just in the a constant thing no
to the drive okay sing the bus what is

154
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,819
valid

155
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:56,879
because we're easy to break norm

156
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,610
no meeting complexity ripped a
completely bypassed

157
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,119
sometimes the trip is not bypassed but
its

158
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:07,170
exported to assist them yeah it happens

159
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,339
and it's because it's misused or
misappropriated

160
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,239
so are give you three short examples

161
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,170
but you've probably read about in the
news the first one is very often is the

162
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,429
case of Sony's PlayStation 3

163
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,850
for pets sony has problem with random
numbers

164
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,389
the CDC's arm and Peter based digital
thing at Rutgers them

165
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:33,189
its BRE BRE Securus it certified by

166
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:37,799
I'll on its done others who want to buy
need to buy the NSA

167
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,569
but you need a numbness ensure undermine
this is not a random

168
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:46,790
then the system completely breaks down
so because of the stupid

169
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,049
implementation or one can recover two
key

170
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,540
just you very easily by doing a
modification in a division

171
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,980
you don't even know to you don't even
need to know how to seduce a walk soon

172
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,209
on 02

173
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,319
getting to know about it the curves

174
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:04,519
to the core system was completely broken
do this

175
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,579
implement in a row another classical
case is that the party for

176
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,639
in web to the wifi

177
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,149
protection web the use this right to be
secure

178
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,480
stern's across the four which is OK

179
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,679
when the key secret the problem is web
is that

180
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,799
the mic but the biggest secret and

181
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,999
whatever not a barbecue does public

182
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,029
and predictable from one system to
another

183
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,230
so if rc4 Wareham I do you

184
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,459
perfectly perfect you shouldn't cause
any problem but the problem is that you

185
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,309
have some internal biases

186
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,649
the structure RT for if you make
barbecue public

187
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,059
and devices can be exploited to recover
a key

188
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,149
that's what up into to web in the last
example is

189
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,629
difference in our your would happen with
30x books

190
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,839
so my purse what they wanted to me
create a new phone

191
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,739
to to make an update that would use a
hostile action

192
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,980
based on the very light books I for

193
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,499
so they want to go the typed down your
kryptonite Burzum

194
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:17,350
you can you can trade in what you will
find the first intellectual the Beastie

195
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,079
a tanker truck tourism which is a
relatively distant

196
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,149
safer asking us to use it a safer

197
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:30,699
as long as the key secret if you use it
because for divorce from Shin

198
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,089
it's completely different because the
key what is you that it is not secret

199
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:40,379
is the message and the problem is in he
is that you of equivalent keys

200
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,040
to a different keys but that give the
same

201
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,559
input-output relations for safer and if
you convert this into

202
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,670
i Function it allows you to by
collisions very patiently

203
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,319
and that's what that's why the security
failed in this case

204
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,749
now what happens if you use a good
crypto

205
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:06,619
you implement it were you use it well
use random numbers

206
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,749
but you are in a hostile environment

207
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:13,449
what I mean due to work in hostile
environments what's the diff such an odd

208
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:14,509
ducks

209
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:18,889
such a tux for some software it can be
for example

210
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,239
I leaks under the time of execution

211
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:27,910
indicator for a yes is are some pic
problematic because if you implement

212
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,889
yes and software you have to use big day
both

213
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:34,939
n axis is that if they both take

214
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,999
time that is dependent on on the key

215
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:41,499
to you know what you have to I mean it's
the time of execution

216
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,970
is dependent on your key so by simple
information to read by making time

217
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,939
measurements

218
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:50,350
you get information on your key and

219
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,439
luster to your hardest the I was with
secure implementation in open as a

220
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,739
singer to 9.8

221
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:01,189
but I'm Swiss researchers day the phone
away to a decade

222
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,739
it that was very efficient in in a few
seconds

223
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:09,799
and interesting thing here is that you
don't need to know the plaintext

224
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,569
you done even know to notice I predict
you just need to make some

225
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:17,749
pretty accurate timing measurements and
then you win

226
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:21,299
and it will close on the on nine for
information opens a

227
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,299
has been patched even though it's not be
welcome in the new year but as I said

228
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:25,839
but

229
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,749
I hope that the version 1.0 Reza is
fixed

230
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,949
website channel can be exploited is a
how

231
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:37,689
in Iran the including is the

232
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:41,629
is managed by the system so this is the
budding Oracle to

233
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,649
to the guy who the guys who made this
putting a good docs

234
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,189
the expert in part banging a beat them
up execution

235
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,850
but this exploit harder system response
to an error in the budding

236
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,609
the Deccan beaten us whether are some
such information

237
00:14:57,609 --> 00:15:01,600
and that was spotted in this but in
Oregon attack

238
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,989
but such a box there are much more
famous when

239
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:08,040
it comes to on where

240
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,299
its much more powerful than software
such an odd ducks you can do

241
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,720
our noses SBA TPA electromagnetic
analysis

242
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,899
getting naked OXM I prefer being and
even more powerful

243
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,989
neither last injection at doxie gonna

244
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:29,319
person less impact to to your sis them
to modify the content under disturbed a

245
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,489
memory

246
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:34,549
to modified instructions it will be
executed for example if you

247
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,589
hobby yes 128 normally you would do

248
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,869
then around the pink ribbon but did you
send a foot on the counter

249
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,639
that it's about instead of making ten
rounds you only make one roan

250
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,629
its much easier to break nigga nothing
happens in

251
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:55,540
Realty a focused ion beam is the even
more powerful you can there be modified

252
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,249
to secrete

253
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,429
modify the behavior of your circuit but

254
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,470
to get owners Duxbury the BBQ Pit and I
could be user

255
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,519
but more precisely to target the
implementation know D

256
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,609
not just the ISM if you want to

257
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:15,619
evaluate the actual the intrinsic
security of supply for

258
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:21,079
you have to view it a snugger -ism
independently of the implementation

259
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,689
and us that's what a great need a doctor
about

260
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:28,989
but let me define it in a quite informal
way

261
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,589
not going to make it back is an attack
that targets the function the crypto

262
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,850
number them and the attack itself

263
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,029
is describe us numbers 'em and under

264
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,100
corporately independent of the
implementation

265
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,179
don't care what its hardware software
you look a sequential restriction

266
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,809
Atlanta rhythm okay be

267
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,059
so I'm both focus on mercy metric
functions

268
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,489
like book safer stream cipher some
functions

269
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:59,759
the normal number generator or summitted
integration cause

270
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,600
there would be very interesting things
to say about but became corruption of

271
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,079
signatures

272
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,130
but the petition for the cold but up

273
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,400
that much time King so if you

274
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
got to decide for us so it is not years
there

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,339
has been some some news about a yes you
probably heard up as: was broken

276
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,630
it's not broken the same for all ghost
you

277
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,470
for the group to group on LinkedIn or if
you look at the US and UK newspaper SME

278
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,120
you may have read that got a broken
that's wrong

279
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,830
same for the 3gpp encryption go to me

280
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,679
it's completely safe tribal this to save
us from issued on the modern

281
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,730
112 bits of security

282
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,240
if you read Bruce Norris blog you might
have read that show one is broken

283
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,669
it's not a you got a story that what was
broken but is not working in reality

284
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:58,860
birthday to you to all those functions
yet there are some cases where the

285
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,980
crypto is

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,320
bit more broken at the Peace Love best

287
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,759
to this is working not due to going to
get tax

288
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,539
it's broken does due to his it's mostly
sci fi dis exhibits

289
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:14,779
if you use a cloth or PGA's in two or
three days again

290
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:19,100
by Nikki a 5-1 just a McRib Shin

291
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,330
there are some problems with the site
for dot

292
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,070
facilitates a actual attacks in a party
there has been some

293
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,720
Prof concept realize and get back seems
to work

294
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
and last but not least because I md5 so
don't use md5

295
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,460
action practice is safe if you just need
premature distance

296
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,909
if you don't care but collisions but is
prudent to avoid md5 completely no

297
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:48,779
you we have much better functions you
might want to do we hav cipher that are

298
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:49,769
not broken

299
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:53,259
even in theory well of course we hop

300
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:57,880
until them before suffering OpenPGP cuss
five it's not very well known but is

301
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,350
very secure

302
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,539
ID was designed by AR researchers

303
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:08,850
not very far from the Sun you into a
rage in 1991 in its to secure a

304
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,100
its wanted to say first that resisted
the best

305
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,570
idea next it's a new generation of ID

306
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,450
the two years finalists surprising to
fish with their point by

307
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,889
in the Bahamas Anderson and some
colleagues into fish by the

308
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:28,529
now you're in a other people when it
comes to stream cipher system so for us

309
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:29,490
our

310
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,809
general I talk to implement great what
we need

311
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:37,600
a 400 very good it fits in fewer than
three dozen gates

312
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,750
so for twenty by dan burstein you can
find it in the

313
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,190
library knuckle very good too an issue
or if you want to to the

314
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:52,190
sorry

315
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,460
I'm

316
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,690
so I want and for now I hope to do with
all the talk with a

317
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,279
but you're awesome

318
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,369
the function so it's safe to use %uh to

319
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:22,710
it's safe to use red bindi if you use a

320
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,240
to create the I think the default
function in the 400 is to recruit diese

321
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,570
rape in the and did for safer is a

322
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,419
a yes and you cannot for you serpent gay

323
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:39,490
now you might wonder while why do we
care

324
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,740
they are many people during catalysis
they are armies of

325
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,409
PHD's and universities publishing papers
and papers and papers

326
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,889
about out not to Brooks a fierce yet

327
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:55,460
we never see really breaks we hear about
the

328
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,529
non broken the news but Redbox seldom

329
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,840
happen so why was a bit so

330
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,519
the first reason is that many attacks I

331
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,279
published I did I got on a yes a very
very high complexity

332
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,999
burnout number for operation that it was
an attack by your

333
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,820
Japanese researchers from NTT on in the
fight was the pre-merger back

334
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,210
which means it was an attempt to invade
to function

335
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,149
the supposed to be one way it had
complicity

336
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:30,139
to do 123 but for operations

337
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:34,389
worse ideally we would expect you to do
128

338
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:38,899
but this is good enough time just
because 123 is a small island numbered

339
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:39,850
on 128

340
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,830
not because it has anything to do with
the security

341
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,740
so birdied is bagged a matter of snow
the forties

342
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,100
into the boat boy default is much larger

343
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,869
and other other attacks maybe demoss

344
00:21:55,869 --> 00:22:00,749
the the important impact on the
Securities

345
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:04,889
you can no longer claim that md5 Haas
128 bit of security

346
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:09,139
if show your company use a crypto it's
not

347
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:13,710
mathematically correct to say that it
hosts went when a bit of security but in

348
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,169
British doesn't financing

349
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,580
so it to be philosophical problem

350
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,019
so let me you discern could buy a

351
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:28,519
college in cassis from the US missed
says that that

352
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,879
the difference between 80 and 100 beat

353
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:36,769
security is like a different between a
mission to Mars in a mission to on

354
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:37,499
fourth-and-3

355
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:41,210
21 very difficult in one almost
impossible

356
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,700
an good thing you're seeing out there

357
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,830
think there's no meaningful difference
between 192 beat

358
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,210
and 256-bit of keys in terms of brute
force

359
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,009
impossible impossible so another what we
don't care but the difference between

360
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:57,830
the numbers

361
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:03,049
a summit impossible to go back to ready
for a minute let's look at

362
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:07,080
what state of the art com Cebu's can do
at the core i7

363
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,539
a to go hence it makes 222 certificate
locks

364
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:15,789
per second which means to the 58 in one
year

365
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:21,210
268 in dozen years and to do 116

366
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,600
in a bit more uncertain billions of
years

367
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,409
if you compare those numbers to do 123
was so before

368
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,720
already conquered up

369
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,059
even to a to do 100 is very secure

370
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,509
or just from

371
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:44,299
subdued do something big and bright eyes
that IQ you can increase you can

372
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,100
decrease your chance of success but
still

373
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,889
we did with your chin use numbers
another quote by

374
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:54,159
security researchers if they dont

375
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,389
decryption don't have to be very strong
just must be stronger than the other

376
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:00,100
weaklings

377
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,159
that's been common sense but if you look
at the cryptographic keys literature

378
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,529
many people don't have this commonsense
reasoning

379
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,609
cryptographer spokesman could do it
don't forget that

380
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:16,340
do something outside crypto now

381
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,220
let me you know review of the second
reason

382
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,580
way a tux or not always a but in the
real world

383
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,669
is that people publish results on
building blocks from the functions

384
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:32,389
not under full function for example
there was this question attack

385
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:36,929
on ish i three candidate code lane
social through will be the new

386
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,029
much from Princeton daughter or the US
government next year

387
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:43,470
sweetheart complexity likely be towed

388
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,349
I did complexity 96 instead of 128

389
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:51,349
did not lead to at the Kandahar function

390
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:54,960
it was just invalidating a security
proof

391
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,389
it was not invalidating the result
because the prof

392
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:02,009
yet the US the then daughter

393
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:05,690
its addition the deemed the attack was
dangerous enough

394
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,690
to eliminate lane from the competition
quite

395
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,929
the president you might wonder why did
they do this

396
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,009
2.3 their positions to attack from
building blocks and components %uh for

397
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:21,740
garth function the first one is to say

398
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,759
what ok its better to hav an attack on a
building block them

399
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,409
North acquittal maybe it's a sin not

400
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:33,460
they would would be something bigger may
be just the beginning

401
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,119
if you read personal your you know the
quote a tux

402
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,849
never get what I would get better who
should conclude this beeper dont

403
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:45,950
and don't use this on the other hand you
might

404
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,960
thing that okay disguise the pub is this
result on a

405
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,129
support one another function so it means
that they have tried really hard to

406
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:55,509
break the system to brag do

407
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:00,190
will function and what do could only
come up with is this

408
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,210
known result on on a building block

409
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,029
this can be seen us movie turns dot

410
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:11,609
people have tried to break it but faded
its new evidence that

411
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:16,259
there were some and it isn't it in
jurate suspicious if there is no reason

412
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:17,499
at all

413
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:20,599
on on a proper function you there is no

414
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,609
condon is published on ridge's Russian

415
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:28,230
you don't know if people have a buddy
three asleep

416
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,049
no move to disorder is on interesting
one

417
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:37,429
is that companies we I've very strong
models very strong security models

418
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,779
we assume the divers are is very
powerful we assume that

419
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:44,820
you can make chosen plaintext carries
chosen ciphertext carries

420
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,549
and recently we a question that began
May treated get docs

421
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:54,429
what is there it get dark is where you
assume that you have access to an Oracle

422
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,929
that gives you the encryption order
harsh whatever

423
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,879
where the key is a modified version of
Georgian okie

424
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:05,809
but not any modification you true the
modification of the key

425
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:10,539
you choose the function f that defines
to keep a prime

426
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,950
which is a function of the or turkey day

427
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,970
which are presently when during his
college in nineteen

428
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,049
forty when the broken ingmar day

429
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:26,230
implicitly use Richard Keys because
they're brought us we're doing mistakes

430
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,940
using the wrong key and then there is
some the message again with the correct

431
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,899
key

432
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:35,769
in the modern version was on interest in
1992

433
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:40,259
refusing the stayed on your portable any
serious political

434
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,970
its competency the bullets complete the
heuristic

435
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,710
there are some cases of protocols like
EMP

436
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,200
Ausra GBP what it seems doable but

437
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,379
the models for special too

438
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:58,619
but to give you a bookmark a good
example of what a retard key

439
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,879
but that can be there was not backed by
I'm

440
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:05,059
person researchers two years ago and yes
by six

441
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,869
complicity to do 119 instead of 2256

442
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:14,429
the use for aidid keys and if you look
at the paper under a subscriber details

443
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,740
not only use rated keys the use read
it's up to you

444
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,940
to limit which summarize the the assume
that the

445
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,470
occur can us for an encryption

446
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,119
with a key there is such dot deceptively

447
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,749
of disorder on has the very spurting
modish

448
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:36,149
addition compared to yours no Suki

449
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:42,059
well that the bird on more insane its

450
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,750
from Kenya you keys

451
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:50,970
and she did then made that the attacks
are millions 30 going to rest the best

452
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,369
and been at present a threat to
practical applications hope you don't

453
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,839
agree with that

454
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,940
K now let's look at what happens in the
righty so in the

455
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,460
feel when I will where i'm looking
pretty pink ribbon we offer different

456
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,740
models

457
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,960
so we could do and extreme ID's

458
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,190
send us the yes them to sponsoring
packets

459
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,789
with favorable CSA common scrambling a
gruesome

460
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,409
know and believe me we don't encrypt we
scramble to the key of

461
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:24,029
for if it has forty-eight or 64 bits

462
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:29,460
that looks quite small but if you look
at the use case how its use

463
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,549
but you can't modify turkey you don't
know the key

464
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:38,049
you only know cipher text you know some
part of the header of the

465
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:41,539
buckets but you don't know a complete
block

466
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:46,510
so you cannot make known but text
attacks dispersion on Playtex

467
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,279
you can make primary trade-offs rainbow
tables this kind of thing

468
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,409
n has been at least you company ten
seconds

469
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,629
to produce a for why because the keys
refreshed

470
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,000
every 10 seconds and a new key is
completely independent on the previous

471
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,460
one

472
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,419
doesn't matter you find everyone maybe
very extreme one

473
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,909
but the still that's what I

474
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,950
a curse up to to fight but your joint
British people did

475
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,549
they don't have the Spireites date on
bring to crypto the tertio to control

476
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,980
water just showed a key

477
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,269
and perfect the bypass crypto again

478
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,109
another less reason is that there is not
only time there's also space

479
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:33,220
there's also memory if you look and it
is up to the does back to the apartment

480
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,450
be five min late night

481
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,889
on a yes 256 the user huge amount of
operations

482
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:43,500
doesn't use a huge amount of memory

483
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,419
more than 1,024 the bites

484
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:50,549
insane the what is a memory

485
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:54,230
no but does not for you need you to be
40s

486
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,109
you did infrastructure the latency to
obsess on the minimum to use memories

487
00:30:58,109 --> 00:30:59,289
not

488
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:03,669
not a small and a problem when you look
at the only this newspaper

489
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:06,889
they make deep completely insane
assumption that

490
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:11,259
biggest same time to a certain amount in
this gonna memory

491
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:14,369
ice to make an X or between two what

492
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:17,869
yeah and if you

493
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:21,019
are enduring bone you should compare to
the docs

494
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:25,809
with generate cutbacks with the same
budget with the same way with the same

495
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:26,789
hardware

496
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:31,029
and undergo presence much different the
charm

497
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:35,139
love money will not do is to be drug for
treating a single computer you will be

498
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:37,070
the cluster of machines

499
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,539
will be there been a cluster of a six
off a PDF PGA's

500
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,359
and this is much more powerful menace to
be brute force you should look at that

501
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,440
and then merchants

502
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,519
paper or understand this topic school
understanding brute force

503
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,379
p be and the last the the most crazy

504
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:58,829
reason is that now we are breaking side
first

505
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:03,149
not by recovering the key but by
distinguishing them

506
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:06,319
what does it mean distinguishing attacks

507
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:12,179
it used to be a home before the finding
of a statistical bias

508
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,500
for example in my house punch in the
first beat is more from the order online

509
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,450
or

510
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,029
the biter FF is bit more frequent and
the other bites

511
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:26,309
now week on a dock anything that

512
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,359
but it's something anything that shows a

513
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,639
an unexpected behavior or the function
sometimes when you look at we look at a

514
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:34,799
yes

515
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,559
we devise a docks where we are seeing
the Dickies known it sometimes but the

516
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,299
key is chosen

517
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:44,230
there are tax doc called known cure
ducks

518
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:49,359
their attacks call chunky attacks do go
to the books is just to find

519
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,859
a relation between the input and output
but is not expected

520
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:58,399
it's very hard to define what this means

521
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,460
you on demand 1010 inventories of a yes

522
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,169
he called to the docs a you know what I
mean attacks

523
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:10,089
because we don't know how to define them
and is an example of attack

524
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:13,279
on the year the two BR two years ago so
the phone

525
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,720
to you they were on p2 p3 and so on

526
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,210
and plant XBR one B-two

527
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,309
and relations DateTime em that satisfied
is racin

528
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:30,220
I early view went against try to
understand it

529
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,240
it's called committee collisions

530
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,990
quite meaningless but the good thing
paper published in

531
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,919
good okay no button security the biggest
impact is under

532
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,470
resume me up the researchers be

533
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:54,470
it

534
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:01,280
I'm when the common this so

535
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:08,280
yes

536
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,720
on the one hand it's not term

537
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,960
useful is not meaningful in terms of for
security

538
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,690
on the other hand the effects are very
sophisticated sometimes very clever

539
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,760
in terms of much much better techniques
a

540
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,280
be used white vinegar isms to Ithaca yes
the use graph theory

541
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,070
to its interesting from intimidation
sometimes

542
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,820
the before criminal confinement

543
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,260
to we have fear not

544
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,330
there are two five reasons why your
attacks on other ways backs and we have

545
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,070
two

546
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,990
dinner interpretations to do it but the
mystic one is dot

547
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,800
all it's about sign in there must be
something bigger

548
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,450
the group does not ideal maybe week may
be broken in 10 years

549
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,090
and your domestic approach it out well

550
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,640
people have looked at it during three
years and could only find a

551
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,210
distinguishing at backward in the

552
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,260
insane a in a requirement so it's safe
the people harbor different the

553
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,050
provision

554
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,589
people are very strongly biased so I

555
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:23,760
try to find reasons why we we hunted by
a cinder

556
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,280
the first acquit fine a in favor of them

557
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,560
first interpretation is the what we call
numerology

558
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,960
cryptographic numerology I didn't make

559
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,890
the circuits notion introduced by other
researchers

560
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,560
and the idea that a

561
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,490
you would defined the security of the
system

562
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,460
in just in terms of decide said the
concert

563
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,750
these us number secure encryption keys
out that big

564
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,589
then you're fine because you can put a
sticker on your

565
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:00,820
products they are two dozen bit security
and then

566
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,349
you have to worry about the rest of the
system in

567
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,780
Wade we do this we do this because
treating a key site is very easy

568
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,480
just use a random generator are you take
your 512 beat San

569
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,270
of much better security you good
internet for snake all

570
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,670
security products you will find things
like your

571
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:26,530
Victrola encryption no with to talk in
bit of security

572
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,810
just marketing 208 mint and

573
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,580
discredits specific case of jurist bias

574
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,060
as yours biases the the minty to reduce
a small risk

575
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,830
to accomplish is your risk so you would
be

576
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,160
lot of money off in orgy of our

577
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,740
to reduce this negligible risk what it
could be

578
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,170
economically much interesting to read
this and other risks they from

579
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,619
fifty a 30 percent because the script or

580
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,589
it translates into relating to resolve
this care in your doctor hanan

581
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,240
maybe two more someone will break a yes
so let's

582
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,089
of recruiters a yes serb-run with Goofy
show iPhone isn't a rewarding it up

583
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:13,910
storage system

584
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,020
maybe her you work people completely
panicked that the idea of using

585
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,900
are if there was only one thousand 24
bits Seattle used to move to two dozen

586
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,660
48 all 4,096 réessayer otherwise

587
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,940
system will be broken form is that this

588
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,410
Cohen was under the law of unintended
consequences

589
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,410
if you stronger crypto if you use a

590
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,420
bigger RC body you get slower crypto

591
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,330
and it's too slow sometimes not deployed
in at the end of the day

592
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,050
you get the security so

593
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,290
that's way that's what how many people

594
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,400
think about crypto but were def so
scared when they hear about attacks on

595
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,020
the US

596
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,770
under the next by your city by Esther

597
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,890
doors they're optimistic approach miss
a-1

598
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,880
several never broken but whether never
broken

599
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,400
because we never hear about broken
ciphers we are you remember

600
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,060
the unbroken Seifert are deployed in
security products or

601
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,390
extend arms winter you're about to

602
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,190
safer that are broken by known
researcher arson

603
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,750
published in conferences in the small
town in Dr

604
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,330
with 25 attendees we're here but as
ducks

605
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,359
was thing to do

606
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,730
very good example of this there's just a
competition for the new HashMap

607
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,600
conducive 64 some missions

608
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,029
and 56 have them were published in 2008

609
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,830
to try to break them and we could brick
14

610
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,930
with actually ducked up work but could
be implemented in that could be verified

611
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,230
we did find a truck regions we did fine
a sharper images

612
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:05,290
these are real attacks 3202 particular
trucks and complexity

613
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,940
proximity to the sixty which can do you
know you few months with a

614
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,920
with hardware and 14 very high
complexity attacks

615
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,280
this looks much more balanced n

616
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,560
miss 14 pursueth I for that were broken
with particular tax

617
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,160
we never hear about them again because
da Quinta dos broken

618
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,390
and nobody would ever use them

619
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,410
and that's what particular that's very
poor for a barbecue so first

620
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,980
before they are used the ciphers that
are deployed

621
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,720
have always been a night for years and
years by competent people

622
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,000
that's why there seems to be a

623
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,430
known secure cipher but they are meant
to cure ciphers

624
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,400
now yes film I'm sorry to

625
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,130
from you that a yes is broken by a
groundbreaking attack

626
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,770
the registered on this it's a the
groundbreaking a dog's care your attack

627
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,080
that everybody expects are

628
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,030
broken projected should def arts

629
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,800
not that how are you dream

630
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,510
their eighties much more reassuring

631
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,740
deduct they are just four times faster
than brute force

632
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:29,500
four times and on top of that very crown
lot of memory a lot of data

633
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,890
def a book on a yes 128 in needs to be
88

634
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,240
Olympics I for taxpayers unit to collect
his number of

635
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,830
input/output suffer yes worse if you do
the

636
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:46,230
but for what brute force you'd only one

637
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,960
because they were been picked up for big
spare

638
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,780
and is very likely that the three
implemented a doc in a scene

639
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,589
alien technology with trouble for
computers quantum computers

640
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,700
it's very likely that the Jerry Burt
Ross will compete before

641
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,730
the docs an

642
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,950
I've heard very interesting reactions by
a customer sin I'm

643
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,510
colleagues to help one of our customer
order

644
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,550
good to expertly for other company is

645
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,410
hey I read the paper odyssey that US
isn't secure

646
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,690
through the new party but you'd ever
want to have a yes with the

647
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:29,050
forty-two oughta know how many rounds in
a most rigorous boxes

648
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,400
so I tried to explain to him what was
there

649
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,540
the result what was the impact of the
attacks but he was

650
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,089
pressured up it wasn't secure that the
US would be broken in 10 years

651
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:45,319
on the other hand we have other people
that are completely blinded by your

652
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,609
distributor for a yes/no if nothing

653
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:52,480
a yes it's safe weaken implemented
however we want to be there would be

654
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,680
safe

655
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,210
and because of this that you're such a
hot dogs the No

656
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,940
just aiming at docs the your by them but
implementations

657
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,520
the dealer the pessimistic in the
optimistic interpretation

658
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,869
offer this kind of attack

659
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:13,950
noted me review concluded

660
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:20,950
what I that in this talk so Douglas make
a tax on the bus came

661
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,509
have nothing to do with security they're
just

662
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,849
surgical results you do a complexity

663
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:32,019
from what does a apartment building
block to think wishers

664
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:35,869
good the weak ciphers we don't see them
we don't use them to our program

665
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:39,019
before docking before can in

666
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:44,059
of my colleagues on good money say's
very correct we don't break so first we

667
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:45,630
even with a stick the security

668
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,719
free you look at their attacks on the
yes

669
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,019
so not may be fair to set up it us
security of 126 beats

670
00:42:54,019 --> 00:43:00,119
but adjuster impossible impossible and
we should

671
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,809
look at the facts not should be careful
obvious

672
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:09,390
your is buyers into receivership bias
should look at the actual complexity of

673
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,019
the attacks

674
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:14,109
what the experts say: we should be
careful when you we read the

675
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:17,420
the media on the fate of the
groundbreaking a run breaking a dock or

676
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,329
scary at doc

677
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,999
and twenty-year yes it's fine

678
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,059
but week implementations are the biggest
threat the

679
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:29,170
dispersion software person software

680
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,440
like to recommend you three-year

681
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,469
rated readings may be hard about their
you get a resident cryptography

682
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:40,949
it's a sir to go cepeda crypto

683
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:44,680
where people investigate schemes that
resist

684
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,859
to partially ketchup the state or the
competition

685
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:52,940
they may for example assume that a heart
for few RC Kia

686
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,589
is published and they will try to

687
00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:01,160
the bike system that is resilient to
this enough leaks and some people try to

688
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,890
calm produce

689
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,569
mothers with relate with Realty the
second one is they

690
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:11,349
by brute force how to use a cloud
infrastructure to brute-force

691
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:14,849
systems to be how to break a yes or say

692
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:19,430
using Amazon s3 cloud and the last one
by a plus but you know is

693
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:24,319
interesting to investigate the security
of labor is likely to pull ups

694
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,920
good purpose bus open as a so crypto
labor

695
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,380
not go against such an orthodox leaders
attacks

696
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,019
the orthodox and his conclusion is that

697
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:38,319
ordered labor is always open source
libraries other week

698
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,319
the two thank you for your attention in
the have any question

699
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:49,319
thank you

700
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:04,499
so what is your opinion or how do you

701
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:09,169
is there any model or anything to judge
a well-researched

702
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:12,349
cipher that has some

703
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:16,699
deficiencies verses less research
servers that have come out clean

704
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:20,459
is that burst like personal judgment or

705
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:23,569
there any sort of reasonable

706
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:28,279
way to decide such the right there are a
few

707
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:32,499
tourist takes to Georgia for on the
quality of

708
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:36,049
safer first it's quite addictive by you

709
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:39,669
but should look at who design a site for
us

710
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:44,709
a high which was published a is it the

711
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:48,499
known researchers who published is no
were not gone

712
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:52,509
or friends you should search for a tux
and decide for us

713
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:57,289
literature and that is all knots not
always easy to interpret

714
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:03,739
the doc because people researcher they
want to become famous security obstruct

715
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:07,759
people tend to overestimate the impact
on the result they will say

716
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:11,229
too big without state to get that
several broken

717
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:15,419
so you should be very careful we should
better look at the numbers

718
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:18,649
than Adah acclaim spider

719
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:22,799
good analysts but but any

720
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:26,089
the covery about

721
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:29,229
um a cipher that reduces its

722
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:32,309
effectiveness the my

723
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:36,829
does have the chance to be used as the
the jumping board for another attack

724
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:40,079
so from is there

725
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,159
I mean so me

726
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,289
if tell you the story of show one to
show one was servicemen to

727
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:51,399
so 0 there was in the back but Bishop by

728
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:54,529
a.m. Chinese researchers with complicity

729
00:46:54,529 --> 00:46:57,909
a to 268 I'm not mistaken

730
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:01,739
few weeks later there was no back into
the 65

731
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:06,099
if you slater the phone on but the 65
attack

732
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:10,829
doesn't work the ureter the fun in that
I can produce sixty

733
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:14,119
1261 any

734
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:18,499
last year two years ago or thrown people
follow back into the fifty-two

735
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:22,469
in on his back they were refinements
refinement to the new attack

736
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:25,489
but some people try to

737
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:29,739
verified at docs try to implement them
and the phone a flow

738
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:33,039
India to the phone some issues the
probity

739
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,309
the fifty-two about doesn't want to
61,000 doesn't work

740
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:39,639
and %uh not short on the 68 Attock

741
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:42,689
walks orders refinement they wear

742
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:47,029
very incremental it's not like if you go
from 68 to 32

743
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:50,809
just very few beso this happens

744
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:55,099
but is for Nike dot you will Harvey

745
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:58,329
YouTube rocks for from in pretty good
practical

746
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:05,329
yes

747
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,890
I've seen a lot of research where things
like you have just been telling us

748
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,650
the actually what's happening how how is
one

749
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:21,390
able to actually like coun like sought
out the black sheep

750
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:25,380
in the in the paper distribution mafia

751
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,050
on their to mmm to validate the findings
is like

752
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,109
for even people that have been educated
in

753
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:36,800
writing group algorithms and like
implementing them safely and stuff like

754
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,170
that

755
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:42,319
for them its even hard to get some of
the papers

756
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:47,960
the in any kind of coding language
called into real stuff

757
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,740
right so from for all the math experts
out there

758
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:55,300
is going to be even harder sometimes and

759
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,480
them how do you how how would you say
the

760
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,630
you can get those black sheep to not
disturb you

761
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:07,050
in your time here to basically is like a
waste of time to implement something

762
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,630
which is from somebody that has been

763
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,190
the deploying papers that were complete
nonsense in the past right

764
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,599
so you talk about implementing an attack
or implement you know

765
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,220
safer Unitech an attack I'm

766
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:26,460
bonnie's the difficulty of

767
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,599
implementation and over physician the
later stocks on the yes

768
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,190
ghettos the name imp to try to implement
the attack the

769
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,480
implement all the Queen implement
verified

770
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,599
all they could verify but there is a

771
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:45,450
Limited asx: you cannot complete ghetto
because the context is too high

772
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:50,010
you cannot make sure it out but it but
it will work

773
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:53,010
so they had been made some partial
verification

774
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,640
the very fired up some properties were K
but

775
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,030
you can never hav a evidence not get the
walks

776
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,550
until you you implement a complete
attack

777
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:07,680
and does some cases

778
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,839
a because of md5 so in this case the
Queen implemented a good

779
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,119
get the coalition because that was
pretty cool bout

780
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,250
if you want to verify by yourself the
attack

781
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:25,270
arm it's not only about ciphers right
yeah

782
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:29,450
you have proper called where there arose
in indep in papers published about them

783
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,589
and sometimes assist

784
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:34,970
hot too grass what was like okay there's
like this

785
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,680
the problem without my pages all of the
documentation missing

786
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,190
you would need for anything to validate
what's out there

787
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:45,569
and if if you may differ to implement
verify the results

788
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:49,890
the problem but you won't get the paper
published or you may put it in a firm

789
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,740
but deliver published paper us where r

790
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,099
people are pointing out mistakes and
produce Bieber's

791
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:00,430
we never do that people are too busy a

792
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,930
increasing their resume a don't spend
the time to verify to prove they don't

793
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,150
spend it dime to implement the attacks

794
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,760
to you anyone is a willing to do this

795
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,800
would be very good but its big problem
come in the community we have

796
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,960
pent-up results but have papers but no
one but it's very bring the results

797
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,540
but that a

798
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,460
like to add to the shy one conclusion
there numb

799
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,780
recently um have so many published a and

800
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,230
ninety bit near collision well for
someone

801
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:37,770
I just like to at wonderful

802
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,780
for ron's but did

803
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,560
wasn't an academic Europe a conference
in I

804
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,400
do with it was the perfect concept in a
reduced version of show one

805
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,400
identity don't have to be some but
should look at it

806
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,570
not a question

807
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:11,110
thank you idk
