00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,810
right which is yes that

344
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,400
not only do the Headmaster's not know it
as is

345
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,600
but the customers on offenders is yeah
people are forced to buy

346
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,060
which is it all conventional

347
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,140
hers crazy acres and getting a signal

348
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,330
from have been the issue use this and
play

349
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,170
talking to it yes he wanted

350
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,410

you

353
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:02,400
fathom

354
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,540
this or K

355
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,310
here use my already

356
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:17,120
okay sir but it's better

357
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,120
hash

358
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,130
bosses crazy that picture

359
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,140
but as you can see the martian

360
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,210
there's a bunch of stuff the so

361
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:39,160
we we tried to you actually made

362
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,830
and has this say why anyone here

363
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,150
howitzers altogether play

364
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,490
you must mushrooms world to get together
in

365
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,770
he conceived

366
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,770
one generously me sad

367
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:04,770
for now yeah

368
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:13,679
go him any yet together a few basic
incidents as a southern overall

369
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,420
methodology

370
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,840
around what we want to do is a
penetration test want to get out

371
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,480
and from there Chris started the mind at
in the office then it is

372
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,370
the freeway we want it out each day
penetration testing you had people from

373
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,730
all different types of love experiences
and energy for that business people that

374
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,830
legal backgrounds you know position so
it's kinda comprehensive

375
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,160
idea how Trish cash flow hedge do it

376
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,420
again protest are a checklist applique

377
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,840
do this have just had this happen but
okay where

378
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,970
his head is this readiness

379
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,020
its hey is a decide on this can affect
you notice the methodologies

380
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,010
on Blaine House doesn't save your
abilities are scheduled for release K

381
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,260
there's just cannonball for us as is not
what you want on please

382
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,650
energy run expert how did you actually
have to do work yeah

383
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,910
ish look a we're doing fine exporters
exporters

384
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,410
for the 100 and that were and I guess

385
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,770
the 100 s least me is the impact
business

386
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,150
in fact the organization is supposed to
be free simulations for sissy maid women

387
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,750
tattoo session do

388
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,140
and so you usually ASU types of things
they had a musician

389
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,790
to see her next 31s just get own all
your stuff posted on the internet and

390
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,420
such horribly or two you sing liberation
you can actually see what they're doing

391
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,880
this medication fish

392
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
a program network and test was designed
to do

393
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,230
this it was designed to find a
Stanislaus organization

394
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,950
well what program maturity miles need to
do in order to get to a

395
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,150
I'm almost here and from their hands

396
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,650
and unnecessary and as anybody you're a
resident iReporter

397
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,340
someone you're ready to retire missus
report

398
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,220
you know once you 3 hey diminishing risk
it again as anybody

399
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,120
read it always resolve obviously done

400
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,250
and went out so those horse so

401
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,929
I yeah

402
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:16,350
yeah his report pages and

403
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,060
in this is anybody fish there is an
almost limitless

404
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm as anybody who's ever more for
anything tangible day

405
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,210
didn't see Crist holdall

406
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,900
yeah me it follows

407
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,200
and doesn't possible is that is not what
it was designed to do

408
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,429
you know vulnerability scanners have to
absolutely clear that an organization

409
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,500
racial all imagine was just as you don't
have any cash transfer program on

410
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,320
systems are falling in with your

411
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,620
standard are you developments gradations
they're not designed administration's

412
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,390
Essendon reason being is

413
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,520
you can't figure out how to get back to
business risk and it doesn't give enough

414
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,730
information is not

415
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,790
him going

416
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,240
0 you gonna so hey

417
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,529
yeah

418
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:11,860
I ambit what I see is what we do
penetration tests

419
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,100
um what we do you mean we have a team
internally day

420
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,200
page report without yeshiva six people's
views administration yes we do poorly

421
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,289
enforced or so international wire
service call center

422
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:28,220
we also believe the administration has
an individual specific business units

423
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,480
as you want risk we head towards an
associated business

424
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,909
what's important is if you look at how
an organization actually generates

425
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:37,019
revenue and that's the only reason why
we're here

426
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,070
always wire and securities is the
measure the company can still make money

427
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,820
it no one else cares about security
scares me that Hansen

428
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,320
is making a difference was wearing
company but the only thing is you're

429
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,690
there

430
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,880
tacked on to give the lanky making money
brief

431
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,419
loses as rest whose really functionally

432
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:59,779
insecurity we're trying is major doesn't
break

433
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:03,029
make sure you don't lose and

434
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:06,730
and police whiteness does

435
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,470
9 does I cannot accomplish that task

436
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,730
any way she at all

437
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,360
all the is you hire

438
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,850
that connection is something that may or
may not

439
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,240
exist that is that is

440
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,450
yes unicorns and butterflies

441
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,940
I as they can

442
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,360
tell you the last time that everyone
does penetrations

443
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,580
is very very rare on

444
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,299
and where is ageless get organised are
all-natural

445
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:49,840
we have you know internally have red
zone Nationals deploying his cancer

446
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,779
Natasha

447
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:55,289
maybe some thousand schisms 87,000
systems and what's worse is that might

448
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:56,240
be our best bet

449
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,630
process and that's the only thing we use
it for is that if I does addresses

450
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,710
through the penetration testing aspects
in

451
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,070
so you know it's great for environmental
got you

452
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,049
pours a hazy here's a pointless two
years ago here's the data goes down

453
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:13,720
and looks pretty great but it does
actually nothing when it comes to you

454
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,100
you know an attacker now yeah it will
reduce your address last day

455
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,049
we're talking to ash ashes comes to
producing exposure they had

456
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:25,039
but you really need to get that the
jello where to start problems I'm scared

457
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,679
program

458
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,850
and miss you measures I don't you wanna
see

459
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:34,010
no ammunitions and I find CEO Josh I
know there's a problem I still see some

460
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,139
words were that

461
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:39,260
exposure came through where you that
business unit was involved in a great in

462
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,010
the security

463
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,289
or we miss something in our team
Williams was gone and investing

464
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:47,220
that occasional fall into production we
are fine with it was air

465
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,620
in order fish a problem for because
guess what you know if they said one

466
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,289
suggestion one million six months later
and had a session

467
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,639
things for us and say

468
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,690
on how do you know what the impact is

469
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,809
your organization and leisure right but

470
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:08,049
your YouTube gm&f column me

471
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:13,559
chain for him

472
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,870
hmm

473
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,820
ok but I Z but do

474
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,820
Road same how do you

475
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,200
home you know what really can happen

476
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,419
with enable you to lose their investors

477
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,059
whether it's low or I'm murder

478
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:37,480
microphone in various or not your days
right

479
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,330
I didn't really know what the impact is
any you just

480
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,559
after except Ron was

481
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:49,159
re K yeah you I

482
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,289
closed please some I fully agree with
this

483
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:56,679
yeah Big Bird I'm I think

484
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,029
generally there is the issue living this
reason that there is a perception of

485
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:01,679
what event this is in 100%

486
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,820
them but we also have a problem happens
over there is a

487
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,389
we want the Panthers the scope is a
former national writer

488
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:12,990
you actually read and guess what hold
anise and as for instance

489
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,190
up to us to search engine and that's why
and when I don't have access the

490
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,750
company's

491
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,720
I to 10 grand SSA a working on a bill is
going to exploit

492
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,629
and a good twenty grand wanna be a
little more actually shows with her and

493
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:25,549

494
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm only gonna go with that company am
in a position where somebody gonna do

495
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,659
that are not secure

496
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,750
I miss Pasha 10 grand to get from using
the word

497
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,460
divers in the air just throw away the
trash per in

498
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,480
but how do you get the organization
switch from a month

499
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,049
this is because this is what we get do

500
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:47,480
this is the perceived value that will be
in adoption

501
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,029
yeah you get da she gets there K meme

502
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,750
you can II

503
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,830
I report my rights away

504
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,700
I S use a push housing

505
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,990
you what you need in order to get

506
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,399
about is is some

507
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,490
should singers from all around the world

508
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,879
delay together Hugo

509
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,649
cases will be or like what and will hold

510
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,399
drive that for you because I yes the day

511
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,409
we're trying to drive progress and

512
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,750
in if you're not driving we tried

513
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,159
so how do you get home the right support

514
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,169
to get his this crazy

515
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:40,300
glasses to check I think own

516
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,060
bigger areas and its and I'm taking
sides exam

517
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,429
Nottingham good investment spectrum

518
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm from a customer perspective I really
going insane

519
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,740
okay you'd understand what is up with
bigjumbo

520
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:59,630
do we don't understand you you want
impact analysis

521
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,990
there we go and then it will be the
montana

522
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,220
and then they come up with something
that says

523
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,520
you know could be both and I think that
is with the gases

524
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,640
the the people doing the penetration his

525
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,609
should not only understand yes officials
to really understand the business

526
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:17,500
networking

527
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,330
the finance business you know that with
%um a masher

528
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,740
administration has should have business
and then

529
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,839
for I mean that comes it comes out on
the green interactions are harder

530
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,099
stopping the huge man how their short
positions on the competitor intelligence

531
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,510
vision higher echelon get how the
orangish

532
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,580
generates revenues it comes under threat
modeling

533
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,000
reaction determine where you want to
target the organization we want to have

534
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,510
happen the most

535
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,970
shells right had only domain and he's
not

536
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,720
anymore is this you know it's it's fun
for us actors we get over later you know

537
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,869
yeah immediately nothingness compared to
the business

538
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:56,970
absolutely but within the business a
between somebody that wants the benefits

539
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,630
and

540
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,460
sort of understand what it is church
somebody somebody that wants to move

541
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,830
yeah in this get involved but it does
look at it let's look at the internal

542
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,900
a loss because I think a lot of is a
good reference point to how to inject

543
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,900
into PCI

544
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,030
West came from not nothing know is are
not as a as a small foundation where

545
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,240
they did absolutely nothing when it came
to you

546
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,270
application security and Richard drew
and peace at any clue that

547
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,560
and in it he said estan now I'm not
trying to say compliance is in any way

548
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,069
shape or form

549
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:31,960
a way to bolster program but right now
in the CIO specifically seizures you

550
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,950
have an interest has not by a reputable
company

551
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,800
it actually new foundation for teacher
notably sir docking this

552
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,010
at my yet he hasn't done its like

553
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,609
they makeup magic were and they don't

554
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:49,750
fine that were white Lee

555
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,880
no one really fun no one

556
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,330
no one has to find and testing yeah you
re

557
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,740
all no

558
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,859
we will and no what I would say is a PCI

559
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:06,060
chorus does pts in there

560
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,540
it would be nice it is to find one
administration test that should be

561
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,540
not and there's a an expert at where

562
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,920
compliance no issue before she never
dress free for here

563
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,270
does security from the foundation is
applied to the fall into any

564
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,130
you might have to make some minor
modifications like head writer policy

565
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,450
for policy to fire his yeah

566
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,440
her that's what I had a policy for
possibly the rest as the hallway

567
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,960
Maharashtra dr. Harry Potter seven
nation and blah blah blah

568
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,869
because I thought my security firm a
foundation from a financial perspective

569
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:40,520
so the way to get adoption with business
in my opinion

570
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,060
is you you use it you know it for those
that are in companies

571
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,920
your decision on your end table guys my
way just Energy's yeah reporter

572
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,140
you know PCI and as for the Sox this is
the reason why we should do this

573
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,089
and here's the thing that we should be
asking because you know a lot of people

574
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:59,520
don't know what happened upon with a
small spoon

575
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,000
yeah

576
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,290
point this this

577
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,830
a I had a passion as follows: been

578
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,770
a I

579
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:20,200
know that its get a defiance you take
people they don't understand tests like

580
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,270
when I said and the British yesterday I
was an envelope very tactical folks that

581
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,380
really no idea what s was and I wanna
dance 2010

582
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,260
NY returning the reasons the reasons why
I should never be shaken had a 90 write

583
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,359
it down

584
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,210
that's all it takes to get people to
understand what it meant SG&A

585
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,460
this washes through what you should
expect the coaster you know

586
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,830
reviews for international I scope %eh
what Roche

587
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,490
go after work you know this is how much
you looking at you know the threat on my

588
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,790
dick morris you were born and all that
is is included in said he'd ask

589
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,849
defining that's really

590
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,000
whatever you want yeah is

591
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,060
a lot of times has I'll

592
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,400
poorly because no one has

593
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,670
level expectations I no one

594
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,310
notice back pain a certain type souls

595
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,540
there's we didn't see uniform

596
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,790
you have to remember this is the law a
checklist ok so this is not a cell your

597
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,520
ass from

598
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,250
to you or this is a framework it from
one dollar G

599
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,720
explains what you should expect as a
customer

600
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,160
in what fashion it what you expected it
with her

601
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,530
now were cut short a time so we're gonna
fly through

602
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,359
the whole face a.m. we are basically
dumb

603
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,540
writing the basic stop alright for basic
standard

604
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,180
a and guidance can get to the dollar
it's actually

605
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,630
it actually online today all years

606
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,900
your today okay Nash K

607
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,540

good and it all I is available for free

609
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,060
we all the searchers are published

610
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,170
the and right now

611
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,200
we're looking for two things one is
feedback

612
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,520
because weaving points to our asses for
a year

613
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,790
and we need to make sure that it
actually resonate well with you

614
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,210
companies air tester okay his

615
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:29,480
everybody has individual experience they
had an industry

616
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,660
we were laughing everybody to do that
everybody

617
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,299
so weather is the most junior antacids
you you know someone is

618
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:40,240
as your ancestors one as a legal matter
you're left with everybody else

619
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,920
is free open everybody's pitcher tonight
we have a little 120 people

620
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,000
that an intruder danger natural looking
for when you everybody's experience

621
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,109
to continue to follow through to get I'm
not everything

622
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:55,839
you know you know prisoner reading stuff
I know everything but

623
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,060
no with yesa hey

624
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,220
regional a bit yeah

625
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,530
but himself but is that

626
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,599
even if you're not missus

627
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:13,790
mister actor we have

628
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,220
head I incoming you do

629
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:22,430
shapes and forms yeah first yeah

630
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,780
usually one people writing this because

631
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,210
you're gonna get about more than right

632
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,080
more value going to get if your
technical

633
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,140
and you know a certain section your
skill

634
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,480
at it if you can contribute it less to
the standard

635
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,810
works in practice we've got you covered

636
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,890
we've gotten better standard you

637
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,210
gonna basically which correlates with
the standards all

638
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,240
ever forest after dozens say

639
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,790
to ABC presence not a checklist because
I

640
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,970
on the other hand says alright so what
do you do

641
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,270
this section here are a few tools and
techniques

642
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,480
weather is that you can but you can use

643
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,150
and the guy is pretty awesome I mean if
if you cause a I ever bought like here

644
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,910
intro to hack in person who just wasted
your money because

645
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,960
this thing is probably the best book

646
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,510
up had that thing that I've ever seen it

647
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,020
not close really really follow

648
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,410
and it goes down to the level alright so
this is how you compile

649
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,900
this tool because it only local like
your source code

650
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,170
and this is the library that you need to
use because they were measures only that

651
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,819
and and it's just awesome Solway breaks

652
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:44,330
you could again do this you can
contribute to it

653
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,480
with low now on top of that

654
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,420
