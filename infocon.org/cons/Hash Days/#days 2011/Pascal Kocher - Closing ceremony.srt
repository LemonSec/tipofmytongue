7
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,239

00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,940
an epic showdown is like good versus
evil

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,280
I will leave it up to you to decide

19
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,689

00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:21,349
behind okay I see

59
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,650
I'm here I'm really glad GSM network

60
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,099
some love you were on the GSM network

61
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,780
now we have measure measurements done

62
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,169
you see where the I'm 1800 megahertz

63
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,409
network and it was quite stable the
network

64
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,620
we had some love you

65
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,039
registering for phone numbers and we
could call each other SMS each other

66
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,370
and use the Internet over the GSM
network

67
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,389
their sons fun facts sir we saw on the
network

68
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,770
there was a you'll skip ish which is a

69
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,139
scanning tool which used and negative be
made to register

70
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,880
which of course in work we had a strange
de Paris traffic from a Windows Phone

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,190
I wonder whose it might be

72
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,300
arm actually it try to bootstrap with a
device ID over HTTP

73
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,719
of course a to like net services

74
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:26,139
and we had one iPhone with I was three
hmm

75
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,270
okay the wireless network

76
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,750
we had a one gigabit up and downlink

77
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,300
and the peak was about that 13 make a
bit

78
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,099
by

79
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,950
thank you I mean

80
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,020
our users afraid to use the network it

81
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,820
it looks like it I would be too we have
we have to

82
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,250
wall of wasted wisdom which

83
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,270
showed also some funny interesting facts
we locked during the conference

84
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,620
well come to the hash days as the
cryptid

85
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,000
username overage tgp exactly

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,139
arm date rights cross-site scripting

87
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,169
course it didn't work evenings it's a
secure implementation at the security

88
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:19,930
conference

89
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,620
and I want to be on hash days swallow

90
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,070
wasted wisdom which he was

91
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,719
it those are the funny things but also
we locked

92
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,130
user names of course I'm ap

93
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,400
FTP that's what we saw before and

94
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,699
different updating arm like anti-virus

95
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,070
updating are pulling things

96
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,909
via FTP Tom is it's the working in the
back

97
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,480
or is it already down

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,410
it's a working so if you have time just
have a look

99
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,270
I'm I will go too far into details
because this will be a

100
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,180
all published on YouTube on the opening
ceremony and

101
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,100
I'm really glad I'm here I can talk
about opening ceremony and I'm here

102
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,770
again and I can talk bout

103
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,430
I'm we had a mystery challenge which I
did not give you too much information

104
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,190
nowhere

105
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,760
the mystery challenge appears if you
look too at

106
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,720
on the booklet big a few there was one
QR code

107
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,720
which looked a little weird this cannot
be scanned

108
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,960
normally at the I don't know what to
last percent of the scanner app sedgwick

109
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,420
which would be able to read it

110
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,850
but if you look at it it looks slightly
weird as a QR code

111
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:43,390
so if you turn it by ninety degrees you
would see some sort

112
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,300
of working down there if you look at it
in detail you see it's

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,360
written mirror so you have to scan the
QR codes

114
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,720
through mirror and what you get when you
do that

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,900
through mere you get you found one QR

116
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,430
not try using it twice you enter QR QR
as

117
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,190
easter egg and you get decodes

118
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,270
tebe white cue one or three times

119
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,570
which is rock 13 for gold okay

120
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,130
some %uh view hold gold without actually

121
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,710
