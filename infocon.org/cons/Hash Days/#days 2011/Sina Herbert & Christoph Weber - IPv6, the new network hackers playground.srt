1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,010
a

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,030
most important one but of SIS is the
best point

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,380
bit or a lot of reading of

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,730
lost some information about hacking ipv6

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,730
is already written in in their offices
problem is

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,800
most people means that ipv6 is more
secure than I before

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,470
it can be configured battle

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,100
and more secure but you have to do this

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,370
buttresses most implementation about
ipv6

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:51,580
are the same I ipv4 there is no I P sake
no out that the cation had the like this

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,809
that people start now grow up begin
start configuring this now but

12
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:00,960
it takes a long time the whole world do
this we 536

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,489
on the other problem is HTTP Server

14
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,840
who's running on port 80 is the same
Saurus

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,520
the same program in ipv4 them in ipv6

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,229
that means to have the same problem the
same issues

17
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:21,290
like an ipv4 we have some new problem
star

18
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,200
ipv6 relevant but the

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,210
yeah me show you some of this all
problems is sniffing all the stuff is

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,450
the same stuff

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,069
you can use the old tools implement ipv6
stack

22
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,539
and both of them are booking the same
way

23
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:44,079
and here we have a show to overview

24
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,319
on the old world we have ipv4

25
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,780
some pols here

26
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,100
and the tunnel problem now we have ipv6

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,590
be can combine Tulsa b5 b6

28
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,779
be can dual spec ipv4 and ipv6

29
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:06,789
be can dual stack beef tunnels and if
you see here

30
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:11,050
we have more problems than before for
defending all this network problems

31
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,130
before we have three problems now we
have seven

32
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:19,900
that means you have also more than
double the space of problems

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,900
to the part is that you can attack yeah

34
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,110
K um yeah

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,530
now the problems behind find the tyrant
arm

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,800
can do scanning but some think

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,450
on arm and IP addresses

38
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,590
lot of began use DNS

39
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,440
DHCP yeah can have a look and look fine
to pay half on

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,220
or NetFlow it's very be useful

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,829
um the other one is yelping I'm over the
moon to call stock can use some

42
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,260
moved to cast DNS on

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,440
show it and and the next slide so if you

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,019
do with Ken the target it's only a

45
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,140
flesh 64 and we have the slot of IP
addresses

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,400
have scan so it's some not very good

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,489
arm yeah the scandal

48
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,129
take some with this lot of

49
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:28,629
from years you have to scan so on

50
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:32,440
yet we have to find another via to do
fine

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,319
trying to target game

52
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,120
can use the tooth the CNS so

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,840
arm the the nice to let some

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,060
called DNS staked arm

55
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,280
have to look that with nato

56
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
arm yeah are can arm

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,310
scanning just assembled IP addresses

58
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,790
can use them 5.1 dot arm

59
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,000
eighty or def because some

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,400
yeah at Mintz I lazy and use

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,630
for farm home

62
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,959
use for for HTTP Server the

63
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,299
on board a PO for DNS some dot

64
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,930
30 33 on

65
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,510
cm some most problem of that some

66
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,210
companies to do not have a ipv6 plan

67
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,330
so total to yeah

68
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,659
since good so

69
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,360
some food first one of the in a stick to
be half

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
phone 7 for you can use some

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,650
units take for example both with IBM so
on

72
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,969
BC arm yeah the vessel to

73
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:56,010
some yeah IBF IBM have

74
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,969
3 testing ipv6 else

75
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:03,719
so maybe we can you with some this one
for looking

76
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:10,719
test yes the third example worth

77
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:15,219
smits so be arm can't lot of more
information about it

78
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:18,729
and but we've gone and see with

79
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:21,830
arm yet some apollo fuses

80
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,070
them how to config this IP addresses

81
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,870
arm you I use here

82
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,500
among you see 'em thus our IP addresses
are configured for hand someone

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,500
manually yeah

84
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,460
like some yeah if you have flocked fight
song

85
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,900
yeah you can use a spoon

86
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,259
arm the you spoke to IP address a senate

87
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,120
them you can see um you sis 1.4 ample

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,379
on yeah

89
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,169
you you all this have to obey other that
can be you

90
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,539
use of private a extension so the

91
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,460
I appear to us can change thing

92
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:22,460
came this became too

93
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,180
K

94
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,150
problem this issue on a remote you have
seen

95
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,870
we can use the in this but if you are
local you have more

96
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,970
ways to find hosting the local network
first the a/c

97
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,810
this out but this mot de koste address

98
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,250
with don't poke doctor

99
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,480
but one did repressed cents all hosts in
the local network

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,540
that means if you send out the ping
being six to this address

101
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,010
on this interface you see the first one

102
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,070
is responding and other all other one

103
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,080
are also report responding and just see
here you offered up

104
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,750
that means you have more than one on
through but all devices

105
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,400
that have a no file on site

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,350
they respond with this if yes local link
local IP address

107
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,560
that means if you send out one packet
you received the most all

108
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,010
local connected device by IPE the link
local address

109
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,970
if we have seen a then

110
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,560
on received a noon near non-public 82
that means at all

111
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,970
10 ipv6 devices in the network

112
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,090
show this off the roads life

113
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,720
then are some protocols inside

114
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,300
that means the multicast listener
discovery that's the way they can send

115
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,730
out

116
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,590
one packet and the all clients have to
responsibly church

117
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,950
Malta costs abreast they are listening
on this is rare in formation there are

118
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,430
very good

119
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,440
information insight on thrust much

120
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,290
you see you be do this with Cappy

121
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,190
it's a very useful tools if you need to
create ipv6 packets as

122
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,960
it works very well here's what you have
to

123
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,510
send out do ipv6 best this this nation

124
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,340
address with me Rick percent all link
local address is

125
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,700
the next have a type and then you say
also need

126
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,630
your information only this shorts doing
certainly owe you

127
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,219
information and I received all this
information back

128
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,840
deceive you have to notice a big dump
and

129
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,590
if you see here there are different
addresses

130
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,120
on throwing of sending information out
maybe he in UC

131
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,130
is a multi-class to address reef 5

132
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,630
on the event or six this represents that
means that

133
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,150
on this address of some OSPF routing
device is running

134
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,660
we have few FB

135
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,130
that means that this some OT cost DNS
over

136
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:22,130
is running or listening here also use
the

137
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,010
but one maybe this all the other devices

138
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,060
there are some other groups at all
answering but

139
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,220
about if this informational found a lot
of information but is currently running

140
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,770
or

141
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:44,770
which devices doing what in your local
network

142
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,270
min sorry

143
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,770
if not we have more details then that's
that's a new feature from

144
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,290
my at Paul that it's called cellco month

145
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,330
it's a very interesting protocol because
the

146
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,190
each device sends out the packet and say
hey that's my name

147
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,230
or if somebody asking a name his sense

148
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,620
and also us back his other spec and it
sends out to the multicast address

149
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,940
that means every device in the local
networks

150
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,710
receive also this packet and put it in
his local stack contain all

151
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,970
maybe I can use in the future if I need
to connect as the this device

152
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,550
almost thurr

153
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,450
Apple devices turned on by default be
called maybe

154
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,870
iPhone iPad I whatever I

155
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,480
have made clear you can also turn on
some devices in the mix a bomb tore

156
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,870
if you install a book station Russian
it's also

157
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,830
on by default not on the solver motion
you have to

158
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,870
received some capture file from

159
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,680
a camp little bit outside the room
Berlin

160
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,720
it's a bonfire capture file the front
end sent me an assay okay I have a look

161
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,740
what's inside this capture file

162
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,880
mode the cost devices and you'll see you
there are a lot of

163
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,150
ice sending back is information you have
for

164
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,420
yeah maybe just found some interesting
names but effort by the example

165
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,220
about this now we have seen that

166
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,280
a lot of mobile devices that are
connecting with

167
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,460
a by less are running ipv6 tax

168
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,220
we have tested briefer ACC

169
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,270
he sent does not send out any

170
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,510
more details then it's a crest see only
on through fraud the

171
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,040
on some paying devise or no being sent
this

172
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,040
but did not active he sends out
information

173
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,400
here is a some iPhone he sends out

174
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,600
over by less a lot of lot of information
you asked about some service

175
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,940
make some saw this text already inside
oh that's

176
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,940
some useful information about me yep

177
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:23,110
and this now we go live

178
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,540
yeah

179
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,540
gym

180
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,000
now we have for on the other device

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,600
here we are connected to the has stays
wireless network

182
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,710
this simple captcha be sent not out any
packets ralsh

183
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,770
just listening and the let's have a look
for the receipt

184
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,950
will I think

185
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,510
to may be here somebody knows his people

186
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,970
yeah I seen him yesterday FC 0 SE this

187
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,060
as your iPhone which the name of the and
the

188
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,120
few seconds later it turned off its
wireless connection because the

189
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,270
yeah don't trust me for some reasons

190
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,270
and you can see here

191
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,660
be found the link local IP address also

192
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,540
and heavy have this address weekend if
you are connected in the network

193
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,830
he can scan him weekend connect to him

194
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,180
if yes SSH opening but they have

195
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,470
additional information from him be no
maybe

196
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,860
his name some people have full name
inside or

197
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,920
the name of this iPhone or girlfriend

198
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,890
it's very interesting is a beautiful
other phone its

199
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,970
month

200
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,560
most

201
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,480
that's

202
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
yet that's a standardized protocol there
it's the same I can I be four

203
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,310
but the benefit this here normally those

204
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,810
phone are only protected by ipv4 and not
by ipv6

205
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,230
of I was not only brought two ipv4

206
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,030
and you to find the information what's
going on

207
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,550
that yes additional ipv6 is enabled and
the show

208
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,020
some benefits to show you later because
if you are connected in a normal by less

209
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,520
you have on the ipv4 that goes out but
ipv6 is not

210
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,480
running I say behalf of the birther

211
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,570
short presentation what we have done on
a place

212
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:04,570
with a little bit more devices

213
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,920
and here we can also showed up in
permount here we have called the not a

214
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,100
lot of devices

215
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,120
ipv6 devices here but

216
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,180
you can see here all this device is

217
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,639
you can't connect or try to connect

218
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,790
problem is there are no proof that the

219
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,009
send out the ping and then out the
medically scanned this device or

220
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:29,889
something like that

221
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,339
but I think with the bill right this
tools in the next time

222
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:38,380
because yeah you need more information
how ipv6

223
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,160
networks really box and for this reason
we need

224
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,880
real-life test and we need capture five
to analyze it

225
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,790
how this stuff works really books in the
life and my mom

226
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,660
bf read all these are of cease there's a
lot the written then

227
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,269
but life tests all more useful for us

228
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:04,269
here we have currently I think 6 ipv6
devices on the network

229
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,449
there's not a lot here but

230
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:15,449
to

231
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,279
um yeah now we have they did in

232
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,290
this netbook fear farm just I

233
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,990
did it on our the main station in
Tunisia so

234
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,860
arm never get some information about
something i phone user

235
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,270
so um yeah you see a saddam

236
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,410
some people really a

237
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,750

238
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,080
so yeah the name it like

239
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,640

yeah hi toot

241

and but they are gonna do with
misinformation your weekend

242
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,180

243
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,569
so be no arm yeah first-person

244

yeah and just the plaza information arm
but the spill

247
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,699
but what point school the but bf2

248
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,050

interesting

249
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,250
though arm yeah you have picture I'll

250
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,540
of LB have fun year 'em

251
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,190
you know her education

252
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,870
armpits companies she's going to be back
for around

253
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,500
she comes from self a little low YouTube
EDU

254
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,650
for from hell and um yeah

255
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,510
and this is only the information we got
from the mall to cast a nice

256
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,809
him

257
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:59,120
you see this post lifts in

258
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,020
a can either but the Facebook entries
says here

259
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm company in Switzerland but this
through

260
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,929
because we have seen is & soneec main
station term

261
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:15,480
babies just the number you can call her

262
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,740
and yet

263
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,280
this think there's also we have phiri
ICANN's best

264
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,510
to restless today and he today you can
see

265
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,059
people talk going and coming do it next
to our wifi point for some people try

266
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,220
kings were useful

267
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,270
but yeah its I think it's a step back to
normal or driving times

268
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,270
but the the protocol also says that you
use an iPhone

269
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,270
and death we tried to hack them

270
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,110
Andrea additional information its easier
maybe to hack the iPhone mister

271
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,660
if it's Berto break though something
like that that's is a def

272
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:00,660
background information to calm to find
the right password

273
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:10,090
yep lead

274
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,090
the I think it was this morning the

275
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:20,090
BB puts this before sending out

276
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,980
your Nov but you can do this

277
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,559
but known as if you like it all

278
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,919
you can go though other you can do it on
all the places you'll find a lot of

279
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,500
people

280
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,200
interesting people into depends on the
name

281
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,539
also be firm multi-class problems

282
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:50,049
attacks you can you see that is a
multi-class protocol

283
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:53,360
he sends out packets information if the
name

284
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,440
but local and every client in the
network received this and start this

285
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,130
in his local cache but happen if
somebody

286
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,100
sends out a lot of information wrong
information

287
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,590
to this mode the custard lesson every
client has to start this information

288
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,070
also in the packet is the lifetime for
disinformation inside

289
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,279
you can say okay this is valid for two
minutes

290
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,309
or you can say this is valid for two
days of three weeks

291
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,730
but they also mission is in inside that
you can override existing entries

292
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,159
read our offices and you find all this
information

293
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,340
there's a large play stuff they have fun

294
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,669
the crate now to our store test this

295
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,899
to tried to buy make buffer overflows

296
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:49,899
there maybe we are successful

297
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,570
the first this more %uh the he makes an
entry in the

298
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,870
the in a stable and the first the bed
too much but

299
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,200
normally use this only for its

300
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,950
yeah

301
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,940
yeah also but the problem is known for
its own good

302
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,850
used for dot local but there are some

303
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,000
requests that you can also use it for
Global Address

304
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,420
and that means if you're bring down the
right

305
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,660
the US over you can send out information
be from

306
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,720
the arrest information to the clients
but the

307
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,320
I think nobody will do this there is
another product roll

308
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,310
microsoft-based I can't remember his
name

309
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,640
link locomotive cost name resolution
protocol

310
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,100
this from Microsoft

311
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,520
be read the FCC's and inside the Arab
sis

312
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,060
you find the it important information
how to hack or misuse this

313
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,090
and that tactic can execute a
denial-of-service

314
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,840
have not to do a lot of research all
information or into offices inside

315
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,390
if you respond more quickly

316
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,950
all information or inside alright the
work is already done

317
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:30,950
just right the tool and use it also

318
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,890
Microsoft has a very good ID he has a
protocol

319
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,250
it hurt called into sight outta martic
tunnel

320
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,540
addressing protocol if you start up
windows 7

321
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,850
yes no I valid ipv6 address

322
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,190
it tries to connect to is up up a router

323
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,820
the font this is a top router he sends
out the request

324
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,090
you can see you the northwest it calls

325
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,160
I need the name the IP address of is a
tap

326
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,170
maybe some bad guys sent

327
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,990
ok my devices that is a type device sent
back an ipv4 address

328
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,230
and what the client is doing it to

329
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,410
maker ipv6 connection over ipv4

330
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,280
to this router ought to my device and
then I've pat pat them

331
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,910
the ipv6 traffic to the Internet to the
ipv6 Internet

332
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,500
this name is default called

333
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:38,500
inside just response to this request and
to become a lot of traffic

334
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,950
also next playground is they they are
too baby 6

335
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,120
you have seen here also

336
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,570
Windows client that are requesting for
by a dhcpv6

337
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,630
for an ipv6 address in this packet you
see

338
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,710
some additional information here you see
the vendor plus

339
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,500
that means inside the yet should be
requests

340
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,549
there are information about that host
system of the client system

341
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:18,020
that means here you can see its
Microsoft about 100 this packet

342
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,450
I can see okay that sender of this
packet must be

343
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,669
up in the system there are other vendors
that

344
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:31,130
also send out information Linux and BSD
10

345
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,450
does not send and out and information
but

346
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,900
buchanan's create for the client

347
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,809
you can send out the information but
this Oct enabled by default

348
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:46,160
like in Windows then

349
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,030
but uplift dhcpv6 if the same problem

350
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,309
you can send packets you can set up by
Rocha

351
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,720
disobedience over running but

352
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,380
if the device has ipv6 enabled there are
some

353
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,020
benefits for us if you like to do
stomper

354
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:10,130
strange things in all the environment i
to be fought they are mission is in on

355
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,130
the switch that nobody can send out

356
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,280
in mission sconce ago to

357
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,320
did to be reversed ovary replies

358
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,940
but the though not only that don't work
for ipv6

359
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,030
and I'll ifill in a but there are some
bass

360
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:32,030
with at the packet that thing from
Heather that you can bypass this

361
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,539
film but via gonna do with a

362
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:44,609
little 10th the third arm DHCP you i'm
brushing

363
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,909
6 some a tech example so

364
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,989
arm me as a client sent out

365
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:54,369
yeah Best Buy IP address

366
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,739
a over you to pee music's so arm

367
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:02,580
yet be just on site and third tier you
can take this

368
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,729
on and arm what we are seeing as

369
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:10,409
and in in Linux versa

370
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:13,649
bite DHCP v6 client

371
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:16,749
arms the client overrides

372
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:20,369
author with of calm so other client
doesn't have

373
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:24,039
a ipv4 arm

374
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,479
address for four before the names upper

375
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:31,029
in and the Kong file is only

376
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:34,239
answer ipv6 address BB gave him

377
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:37,440
and some

378
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,409
yeah thats really I'm cool cost so

379
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:44,440
through client only tries anymore either

380
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,059
to reach arm yeah any type

381
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,779
of well about over the ipv6

382
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:56,009
so arm yeah that

383
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:59,249
what you're seeing so %um can

384
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,909
just injecting new DNS server you can
use

385
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:07,679
your you're gone and blind goth over
your DNS to reach

386
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,309
some some home page and address the

387
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,789
some EPL doesn't support it yet

388
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:18,839
so say don't f'n any n implementation

389
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:24,379
to use some dhcpv6 and

390
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:27,450
term yeah but kissing and Thea you can

391
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,599
Justin and check things the

392
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,269
network information but what we're
thinking as

393
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:37,909
yep it's good for the client some maybe

394
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:41,229
can use the client and the netbook to

395
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:47,729
go over our names though arm

396
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:51,309
a pool it doesn't have for any klein for

397
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:58,309
for dhcpv6 yeah so they have first
appeal to

398
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,950
automatic but if you are use that

399
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,029
it it's not yet best thing for

400
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:10,099
DHCP the only use this for for Tom

401
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:17,099
thing

402
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,850
any you you only have source link local
ipv6 address

403
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,060
and keep can't do it many but if

404
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,260
if you use this without a metric are you
you don't

405
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:40,260
I get and any IP edge with

406
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,869
you can that the NSA king gave it to

407
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:58,869
but but don't get to any yet CP

408
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:18,390
you because Apple don't talk yeah

409
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:22,859
a.m. so that's akin yep you can use

410
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,399
bites yet she prob thinks all too but

411
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:33,399
haven't its yet implemented

412
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,170
yeah but in all

413
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,020
used

414
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:57,020
nation

415
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,279
you

416
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,970
a.m.

417
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,649
you um yen thirty-third possible
scenario

418
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:17,379
so arm for clients connect of our

419
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:20,960
you know a bye love to to the Internet

420
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,070
and I'm now it comes the bad boy

421
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,019
a hint Ron ther dhcpv6

422
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,950
server and to DNS and maybe bebe server

423
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,970
so been them

424
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,350
so arm

425
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,779
yes the batboy arm group the the client

426
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:45,379
the IP address and tiled them yet

427
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:49,679
just youth DNS server and

428
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,799
yeah the client goth now not to

429
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,990
to the Internet um yet because

430
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,690
it's a sin config to use some

431
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:06,690
yeah batboys I'm DNS server for any
requests

432
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,970
okay we have to done this a couple of
days ago

433
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,920
on the big airport near tourist I don't
say the price

434
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,180
but the scene in one hour we have tested
on their phone them on our time

435
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,810
we have on for two more than 200

436
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,520
the HTTP requests unique request that
new seen you have

437
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,320
more than 200 devices that are looking
for ipv6 address

438
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,810
yes in in one hour more than 600 devices

439
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:40,230
different devices b5 b6 in a both

440
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,630
on the big time you have seen more than
300

441
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,740
ipv6 devices in the network

442
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,530
the taught 300 talks that we have now we
have seen that we need the script

443
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,040
takes is information make a very fast
parts Ken

444
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,610
and then maybe it tried to attack this
device this was only one hour

445
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,840
in a public wireless a

446
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,230
in to reach airport ok at yet

447
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,230
you have a bigger a virus hiss

448
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,610
over all over the place there and we
have a lot of fun and see a lot of

449
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,440
information

450
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,250
lot of devices with names beef company
names inside

451
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,730
her its next step will be

452
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,550
do that we do this automatically and see
what happen and

453
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,650
I think we are very pleasure if somebody
ask %uh something

454
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:34,590
give me and I progress beyond just dance
for him we have this done before Linux

455
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,730
it's very useful

456
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,910
can set up in a few minutes it it sounds
very easy

457
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,320
maybe some people here are not happy if
you should

458
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,170
issue show this but you can try this in
your local hash

459
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,800
network here maybe see a more after this
we see more

460
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,800
they should be requesting onslaught

461
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,220
yeah

462
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,080
the president's is that we can send out
ipv6 information

463
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,330
and normally devices used first ipv6

464
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:17,480
then yes the fall back to ipv4 yet be or
be alright the name server:

465
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,710
and then you have because of this nobody

466
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,400
may be due to head the the devices if
the ipv4 address DNS over all this

467
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,260
information

468
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,820
but we overwrite this than weekends out
send out

469
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,870
our information than we have ten-cent

470
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,010
maybe the Denisovans our local device

471
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,620
that we can inject our information and a

472
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:45,750
yet that's

473
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,240
that's defined in or I

474
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,490
that its

475
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,280
they want to push at the to bring the
more forward it's also because a

476
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,320
Windows has in April 7 has enabled by
default I

477
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,900
ipv6 and this the paredo pols if it
cannot connect over ipv6 over territory

478
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,050
tried it first then some information
oldest %uh no

479
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,120
to Microsoft to rate the service and
then to the ipv6

480
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,399
world that's worth ratio here

481
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,429
if you enable the or if you set up in
the system

482
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,880
it tries to connect over to rate I'll do

483
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,270
Microsoft it I resolution of this name

484
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:34,669
maybe if you are and good enough you can
see of this information intended

485
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:37,850
to the local network and then you say
okay this

486
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,250
Microsoft to rate the star is my your
set up to rate the sorrow

487
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,980
maybe the third this a little bit later

488
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,110
much I think oil also

489
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,210
if one client in your network has

490
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,550
a connection outside that is out though

491
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,940
i pp for you formation is in that

492
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,390
he sends out the information on this
address and say hey

493
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,220
I have a connection to over ipv6 and all
other clients in the net talks a

494
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,850
of their something her somebody has an
ipv6 connection

495
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,540
let's try and bow or distal to the
Internet

496
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:23,540
maybe you can use this local

497
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,369
your here we have a bat go you see lead
author

498
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:34,390
the manner

499
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:39,039
a there's a song so short history about
this civil

500
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,660
but I have always bad girls into she
blames me into

501
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,660
the F mixer with the beat-up that

502
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,920
also the the the main menus review book
in the same team and our chief says

503
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,400
I'm the bat boy and sees the good girl I
don't know why but

504
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,650
okay

505
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,549
every half tunnels over another part
then the default port

506
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:10,650
how you can use this have make a short
animation

507
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,670
bad girl cents a main

508
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,000
to some client in the usurper and
corporate company

509
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,109
midsummer explodes inside or whatever he
do

510
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,210
fly-over

511
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,640
plant opens the bomb and then the stuff
those trying to connect

512
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,619
to a parade us over outside the Internet

513
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:38,140
normally the 50 blocks the default port
who iz

514
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,260
set 2,544 file normally block this

515
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,720
but if you have a intelligent the client

516
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,720
it tries all the parts to find a way out
because the

517
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,270
but but but goal has set up a parade us
over

518
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,440
with different parts list earning maybe
port 53

519
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,829
because almost five all its open widely

520
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:08,240
do the pee part 53 and the

521
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,200
and ok here you can see that the crime
now connects over ipv4

522
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,500
to this surah solvent creates ipv6
tunnel

523
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,180
and if you know that

524
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,430
all ipv6 addresses are reachable from

525
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,559
hold the vote back the bad girl has a
direct connection

526
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,240
over this tunnel back in your company
its

527
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,240
it can be may be useful all the problem
is we have a lot of

528
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:46,849
extension headers in ipv6 out of the
says

529
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:51,200
there must be some alter are required

530
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,230
but what happened but the device does if
the

531
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,480
all is not in the third the correct ways
all you have

532
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,839
10 had those miss the same input some

533
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,099
the specs are just crushing if you

534
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:08,599
if they received wrong had thus wrong
size of had those

535
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,160
this I think a big problem that you can
bring down

536
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,049
the local network if wrong ipv6

537
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:19,690
extension had the packages the problem
is those not

538
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,390
no coat coat cool cold or tool available
now

539
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,960
and yeah be tied to on somebody whose
rewrite this

540
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,470
that is sent out there are pluses
pressing tool and right

541
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,819
send out a little bit different packets
with

542
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:40,170
wrong information inside to crash the
specs also there are some planes

543
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,329
recruiting Heather

544
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:44,660
doesn't do so games for fruiting her
that you can play than the

545
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,190
a I simply pack your package is back and
forward between to root this but

546
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:56,190
that's all your all stuff from mostly
fixed in the network

547
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,210
the another Joe %uh mister perhaps all
some other

548
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,520
the issues seen two weeks ago

549
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,780
the it's just them but I think you
talked with those of the world's

550
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:19,860
at

551
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,990
the they have seen a in all the

552
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,020
pic wrote the company its rotor

553
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,300
be have been note that the if they have
the for example they have more than

554
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,320
for extension headers he sends the
packet

555
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,840
anyway through the firewall or that
because they have

556
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,040
the Asda the problem this

557
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,940
if you do this a the router has two

558
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,390
inspect every Heather it and have to
look inside

559
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,660
it is the form you have to do something
with this yes or no

560
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,900
and the and mostly route to do this in
software

561
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,510
because of the CPU usage is limited on
the devices

562
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,760
the reason is they say okay that's
followed them

563
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,760
it may be it must be got them

564
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:21,589
yeah

565
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,820
yeah there

566
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,910
yeah yet but def there

567
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,000
yeah a certain yeah but they're also
speeches

568
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,240
maybe you up for their oath they are
featuring the switch and the exercise

569
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,810
which

570
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,260
that you can protect support that nobody
can center in

571
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,930
brutalize data package us but if you

572
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,460
put it in bonn extension had the between
the information

573
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,530
and ipv6 header they is not looking on
this

574
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,540
and the POF and I think the

575
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,590
made same problem baby in that age
stupid

576
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,630
they %eh HDPE

577
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,580
5-foot-6 because he hath look inside the
packet

578
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,210
now we have on the exit just those cold

579
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,360
any the Heather at the ruble rise to the
package

580
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,030
but its if it's extension other between
here

581
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,920
it does not weaken recognize the
packages and send it also true that

582
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,740
yeah

583
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,330
you see here the extension before for
them for extension headers

584
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,210
also we have

585
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,480
some packets that must past the firehall
the router

586
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,170
most important thing is that has to pass
the firewall

587
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,750
because ipv6 s nope as some limitation

588
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,900
in at the reporter there ought to be
trippin

589
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,590
the whole internet connection can
fragment the package

590
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:56,290
but in ipv6 if somebody

591
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,790
if a link between in the whole chain of
for transmission

592
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:03,910
as a small amp to size it does not
fragment that packet

593
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,550
drop the packet and send the information
back the back at this to a pic

594
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:14,030
make its more the

595
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,080
minimum packet sizes maybe 1200

596
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,780
eighty and yeah if you

597
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,540
felt that this on your firewall maybe do

598
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,720
internet this not no longer working
because

599
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,810
if you have a link small it then 1500

600
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:34,619
and to size the client does not received
any for

601
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,060
information about this because you have

602
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,400
to open this port on any device maybe
you can create the tunnel over this

603
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,310
protocol

604
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,950
a some people can remember some

605
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,040
all tyson beat tolls that though this
the same way

606
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,040
if I simply a show and request no

607
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:05,950
nothing to come to the routing protocols
the he had a look at that

608
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,660
ovitz PF combustion 3 and sell

609
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,870
many key are different for us so

610
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,570
arm yeah then interface can have

611
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,330
multiple our networks configured on it

612
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,930
and and that's mean thea multiple

613
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,890
in sentence per link and

614
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,290
the sauce pictures all the eighth

615
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,780
put the link local address though and

616
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,270
author out indication you remember
always PF version

617
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,690
to you with Cynthia Nahla simple
password enter md5

618
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,940
and OSPF version 3

619
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,170
at dustins support any oughtn't
Picatinny author

620
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:55,040
its youth I P sec this comes this ipv6

621
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,530
and yet support out indication Hertel

622
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:05,210
ESP protocol so

623
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,740
can be had a look at this and term yet
tried to earth

624
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,650
the scope so VCR men be configured earth

625
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,940
art indication had to arm yet the

626
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,510
years out indication had a and after
what to see a

627
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,300
OSPF version 3 of the whole package arm

628
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,980
if you with the CSP arm yeah its

629
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,110
will be in quick to encrypt it so beyond
doesn't see any help pick

630
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,960
saw package content: and

631
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,580
arm yeah if we have a look um our two

632
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,890
books so we can um do a little our show
crypto engine

633
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,560
the connection so I actor on PC here

634
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:53,340
its my piece eckardt's over and the five
so the encryption and decryption the pic

635
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,070
pits are

636
00:44:54,070 --> 00:45:00,790
commenting and if you change things out
in TP cation had to to ESP

637
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,600
arm yet for the um group to engine

638
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,820
doesn't on yeah the connection over

639
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,980
the out indication head to doesn't stop

640
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,200
so arms the connection over españa

641
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,800
will build up see it here but um

642
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,410
yeah Seth nope pickets go or both

643
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,210
arm yeah says connection so

644
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:30,010
but the means its a few change are a
passport on one side

645
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,510
and saddam yea you for bed but on the
other side to enter

646
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,770
the routers crushing so after bouts you
don't have any OSPF connection

647
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,650
because the password is a mismatching
and

648
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,700
arm the other one earth if you use IP
thick

649
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,770
a.m. CPU call South

650
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,990
very high and some

651
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,640
yeah its what if the questions were too
but the third arm

652
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,710
yeah big at the best Sprecher the

653
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:07,270
protective to you that okay I am

654
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,390
if he had looked at them checkpoint and

655
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,410
checkpoint and bath and supports some

656
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,950
IP sec anymore it's the last one in
phnom

657
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,090
absolute dot four-dot to and term for
new versions

658
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:27,130
doesn't have it so on million

659
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:31,320
yeah and

660
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,470
um yeah can try it to

661
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,240
to a little peck Smith KP arm you see
here

662
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,820
its the ilsa me sending

663
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,970
at a internet area prefix them

664
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,380
yeah a trip to swelter and in suspected
some

665
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,700
Gary can do just than

666
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,230
external ellis et so yeah for internal
and external anything

667
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,680
and some center to through to to serve

668
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,850
a checkpoint firewall and a.m.

669
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:08,260
yeah after what's I'm their I'll doesn't
any neighbor

670
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,060
anymore though you

671
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:19,060
law Theo hoon routing and yeah

672
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,380
and yeah and I'll see all to say it's

673
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,450
arm yeah unlike um

674
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:33,980
ipv6 IPSec we r n

675
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,260
in ipv4 ipv6 allowance Alice

676
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,650
eighth a mid-size unrecognized so

677
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,880
yeah maybe we can the just start to end

678
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,560
I did anyway are yeah I'm controlled
introduction of the earth

679
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:57,340
thoughts and if they could cause a stop
area link-state database to crow and

680
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,560
yeah I want the about to head into the
capability a.m.

681
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:08,560
to for have good

682
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:21,680
for I okay a your bf also tried to
attack other network devices

683
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,440
they're all tools that you can use reuse
just maybe

684
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,240
you tried to bring up the CPO high on
the learned the rotor

685
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,369
or the network devices maybe though the
all

686
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,710
problems if you tried to send the
package that

687
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,920
this lost hope is on the router he said
the route to say so much detail is one

688
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,690
I have to reduce 1 okay there's zero oh
I must send back an information packet

689
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:51,460
and descent back ok titty licensing
expired

690
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,920
we have done this in them before another
bigger wrote the

691
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,460
johnnie per their hearts the route as a
limitation that says okay

692
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,230
if I sent more than 3,000 packages that
thought emanating me on me

693
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,230
ascent not more out than 3,000 packages
for security reason I do this

694
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:15,450
but the rest of us the route to crush
the present more than 3,000 packages

695
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,970
on the in one second because the CPU is
going up

696
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:24,170
and has no more space or some tables
overflowing that but the process is

697
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,160
there going on with

698
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,990
for Tony per also we have tried to send

699
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,410
packages with the same source addresses
that the router has some

700
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,770
yes this very the behavior of the food
the network device is a very interesting

701
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:41,390
the same problem that you have an ipv4
be found in ipv6

702
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,760
that means reuse your old exploits
tested

703
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:51,760
and maybe you both your successful yeah

704
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:03,670
duh that's rude

705
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:13,530
yep done

706
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:18,180
I see a lot of this information also we
are but the

707
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,829
for what can I Packers I use ipv6

708
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:25,849
because we have seen before if you
connect your device

709
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,720
before randomized ipv6 address you can
very well high dune

710
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,250
attacking or scanning device in

711
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,240
and ipv6 network turn on a good five all

712
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:42,680
ok everything that's coming to you and
you have to wait that nobody will find

713
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,400
your device and ipv6 or

714
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,020
network also

715
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,700
mostly their use ipv6 the tunnel traffic

716
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,700
the from inside to outside so my DS IPS
or whatever I

717
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,589
protection systems they are available
that ok not recognize

718
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:04,660
ipv6 traffic in ipv4 town of

719
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:09,230
and then dig you can only buy pasta
mostly the security device

720
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:16,010
the problem is fight the actress

721
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,730
not tests all the found inside some

722
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:24,680
new features that the can normalize ipv6
traffic I simply be six traffic

723
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,099
but the problem is that they are not
good first note also available

724
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:32,099
this is starting now your sensei in

725
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,400
Germany so big group does this working
on this

726
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,569
they have also written the preprocessor
but

727
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:43,319
there are you have to create your own
rules that match for your network

728
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:46,940
the here are some rules that I found on
the internet

729
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,000
but there's only a small part 4 of
attacks

730
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,200
that are currently running Internet ipv6
world

731
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,359
but most that are not recognized and
i've seen

732
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:59,530
other vendors that so you can filter
outdoor

733
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:03,510
the tech the I Pirone ipv6 packets but
the

734
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:07,099
implementation is very lazy or still not
working

735
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:11,300
available to all show up to half

736
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,750
your shortlist the very good dollars to
ipv6 the for

737
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,339
play a little bit the round is here from
the hocus choice

738
00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:22,960
also make the sport has all the leaf
some implementation about

739
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,089
b5 b6 and map of course it does a long
time ago

740
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:31,089
but remember and Matt in ipv4 you can

741
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:35,030
if you arrange ipv6 there's no way that
you can

742
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,180
can arrange show can all this can one IP
address for some reason his death

743
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,349
implemented this

744
00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:44,460
yeah but we need this

745
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:50,810
a lot of more tools though find some new
security hole through the the a packet

746
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:51,390
fossil

747
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:56,170
a fosters your scanner foster package
creation tool

748
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:59,680
cappy's very useful for creating single
package us

749
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,400
but if you have interact with with or

750
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,619
yeah that must be more tools available
also for

751
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:09,869
analyzing the profit bf I found some

752
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:13,260
problems in that is stupid I'm pretty
shocked

753
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,770
if you're right the strip for analyzing
traffic there are some

754
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:22,579
missing protocols or normalization in
ipv6 that you have for

755
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:26,050
already in ipv4 but I think it's

756
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,329
now with a list of this that the call
the store will become

757
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:35,589
more more ipv6 capable no

758
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:39,569
future I think most the people use more
security

759
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:43,109
out indication Heather and I P six

760
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:48,560
for ipv6 the problem is also have new

761
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,040
every time you have new era versus that
mean summit

762
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,060
improper implementation that are running
on the current device

763
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:02,060
are out of date with the UFC's yeah

764
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:05,510
on the of this i think is the most
problem that we have in the future

765
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:10,300
all this I P more by devices of
supporting ipv6

766
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:16,079
oh and I think more but provides reviews
in the future ipv6

767
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,200
for transporting ipv4 and yeah I think
with our free up a lot of under

768
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,880
because the implementation of the stacks
and the softer

769
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,680
is still in the beginning yeah

770
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,369
that's all I think you have what the
most lights but the

771
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:36,670
if you wanna reach up on the first step

772
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:37,540
made
