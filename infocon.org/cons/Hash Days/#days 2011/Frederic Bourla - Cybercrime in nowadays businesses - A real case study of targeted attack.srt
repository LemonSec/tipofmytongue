hello everybody thanks for coming
especially fogging wake up so hurry this

2
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,330
morning

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,980
or is important for me and this talk
will

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,080
politically on deal with a crime in the
wooded businesses

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,320
so just to throw the by me

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,660
are I'm guy walks for I think bridge

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,140
on admitted to liking company based in
Geneva where

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,150
our manager to tighten the abutment this
comprende

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,510
magically from we deal with

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,739
on know what is the crimes all just
woods

11
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,989
time

12
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,910
which became more sophisticated which
usually

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,600
no of fun targeted businesses which may
be

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,579
no ordered by been for competitors
softball rules have changed

15
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,030
and his pork is all about this

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,050
so this matter so it's a real post
investigation no

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,009
study which will create left here in
geneva and no

18
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,290
the clay ok will be name here for the
bulk for not reading

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,800
whom to hire you identity the ball

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,229
will on the last or one wrong of 50
minutes

21
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:27,660
so it's quite shop for form to see award
investigation

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,590
so I will try to or to save the most
famous but they come so that we can

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,600
cover everything

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,740
so please keep your question no for the
hand because they may have been on for

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,490
automatically

26
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,910
I'll up into the the last night a

27
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,630
on mockery if we go quickly over some
slight

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,030
everything will be made public are the
video also

29
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,259
so you can you can basically got
everything

30
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,050
without writing anything the project
context by the CLI Justin fewer

31
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,740
left here on this issue of a well-known
financial institution

32
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,000
thank you love an by the CLI there were
thinking about

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,120
put on show a fight against the system
but they were thinking about

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,880
just a kind of fishing at them and not
basically the city or the don't want to

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,099
see the true love

36
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,459
to like this you was a blast opposes for
political reasons

37
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,580
unknown he only wanted us at the
beginning to go with the

38
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,170
a quick investigation in the aim was
curly to help him reassuring

39
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,080
it you or that everything was under
control and that nothing really

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
serves ok to unfortunately a

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,560
he was wrong as you would for yourself
the next flight so we've begun

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,420
with the only one thing that week will
begin with which is

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,500
I'll which are those that email but so
some

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,500
employees in the company's aversive in

45
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,349
soul those made by the claim home

46
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,680
don't think so but thanks which is quite

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,489
quite good and what technical at the
very problems

48
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,670
are we when not thinking

49
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,850
but whether fishing at them because
first you don't up

50
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,880
several grow much downforce byline such
as a although

51
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,140
all kind of fishing at them which come
from China Russia and so on

52
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,320
a the pics were sophisticated many dead

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,520
with a real month for of forex trading
at this time

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,580
for I'm not so we're all in for a table
nor with pretty much nothing in parades

55
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:30,830
but

56
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,660
everything was very convincing to me so

57
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,460
from the beginning we we went to the
great and no we wish

58
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,010
thinking but it was most unfortunately a
target the fact that

59
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,710
just a simple or fishing so

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,250
is included in those though clearly
reveal make the address

61
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,710
I'll although um he does our

62
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,120
just not very interesting in May up in
israel crafted so

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,010
will focus on them we had an IP address
which show was hosted in

64
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,290
when United States with a domain which

65
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,910
existed since four years motion question
is rather

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,580
which show was a a new interactive and

67
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,040
so if we look at this so the website
magically

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,180
without going into to technical the
details we we just

69
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,130
um not just quite quickly that it was
not too sick for whatsoever

70
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,680
%uh because about the mistake
integration and

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,990
all components by the CBI it was quite
possible for

72
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,730
someone was through schemes compromises
quite quickly moreover

73
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,060
a if you do just a simple then if a

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,180
reverse lookup we know too that the
there were more than

75
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,050
eighty domains which were posted on the
on the same several and most web site

76
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,020
where also

77
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,900
be able to campaign from a web
application Grove

78
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,100
Cut Pro could put him in the in thing on
Cody fight

79
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,450
for up but both which so

80
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,580
altogether mind give us so strong
likelihood that

81
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,040
something wrong hope your and that the
web server may have been

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,410
a compromise most probably just to send
some question may switch

83
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,979
called the let me take you remain
anonymous a

84
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,520
and also by .4 for of a lot reading is
that

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,780
loans is the main the Habana next
recalled info by the clean

86
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,010
or people who received with a male most
probably

87
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,500
on

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,730
receive it in that Inbox you did not
carry out

89
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,900
more all deeper investigation there is
no reason for

90
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,570
for this may 12 been twelve reach the
done for the so

91
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,940
once again it was just the feeling I
think at this point not technical skill

92
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,110
know on the investigation but we were
thinking that

93
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,930
%uh the web server what so with other
was compromised to

94
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,980
Kerry Wood a specific targeting attack
against his training institution

95
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,120
so oh makes one not exploitable anymore

96
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,090
wheel we'd we did haha more information
and we wanted to play on to give us some

97
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,480
if the credentials to want to get more
information or web server logs solve

98
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
this lead us to the

99
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,150
very both beginning of for the religious
bailed fide

100
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:28,150
on Flickr the pale but finally this

101
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,550
home but the clip his website was was
typically

102
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,080
not in for my neck and no at their since
the very beginning we call do not do

103
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,410
that

104
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,600
so there is some mistake no means a
developmental the website

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,060
up for example the rubble but txt a ho
calling

106
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,460
by was a little bit competitive it it's
not so amazing if not for dangerous but

107
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,460
in only 13 goals we called easily be
notified from

108
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,259
with one child Sun City resources which
show which may help someone to do

109
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,770
musty thing you can see the development
interface which is really are

110
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,650
farm policy called on the pollution on
we can see the and nutrition

111
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,830
resources so

112
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,490
boasting was just to have a look maybe
because we were thinking that something

113
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,139
wrong up on

114
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,490
and basically that they'll or website
was compromised but the pound you don't

115
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:20,889
agree

116
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,510
you were thinking everything was fine
and he's own world was

117
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,560
if we were compromised I don't think so
but keep it where the case

118
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,880
it was maybe just for up with such a
publicly available web interface

119
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,949
everything is the removed secure the No

120
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:38,979
basically book with your time but we
really insisted won't get with this kind

121
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:39,380
before

122
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,530
of Creighton investigation as the

123
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,979
existing a cold don't reveal anything
really suspect we we just had the low

124
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:48,300
key

125
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,940
maybe there was a compromise maybe some
more people may have forgotten to delete

126
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,520
in a conference about but everything was
fine only some

127
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,659
or lack of which we're not sure anymore

128
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,720
and no also but practice but looking
resellers so

129
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,810
we downloaded you Jamal the frogs to to
Carrow for that investigation look at it

130
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,639
while

131
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,389
on the point we have at this point and
everywhere in logs

132
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,729
you could've were not to but they were
I'll under attacks quite frequently

133
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,770
by it's not souls so I'm normal because

134
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,430
first it was a web server so it is but
be careful about and therefore

135
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,669
arm nearly but every time attacked by
Scripps and so on

136
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,810
but some reason is that so to trading
your system for

137
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,990
they may have more enemies than you and
me for White Book It in those logs we

138
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,729
can see for example some

139
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,360
a directory for the file them from the
bike injection

140
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,250
I'll which are really much love Korean
official times it was automated tools

141
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,700
no summary cells but just to prove that
yes

142
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,060
they had enemies so

143
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,350
we have no a majority which was to
investigate the lot of luck because we

144
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,540
don't have any time frame

145
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,339
we were thinking that there have been
compromised but it was just a theory

146
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,660
we we don't have any proof for that at
the time and

147
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,550
if it was a case we even bought more
when maybe West wheels before because

148
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,560
the play I'm just do not know what
happened so

149
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,339
we hide the lot lot lava flows and was
not so easy to find something

150
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,140
so we we we run some queries to offer
the deck from but them

151
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,510
%uh we quickly identified from

152
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,770
some problem and no at

153
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,500
%uh as this was a little small queries
because a lot of logs we just

154
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,990
try to manage your time better a and
therefore we will just have a look

155
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,600
manually

156
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,200
on on the secret to develop the on
website and we'd be notified of rhubarb

157
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,230
problems one of them touched

158
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,360
or intention it wasn't the but I'm
jealous

159
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,100
will injection butts fortunately for
them on their wall of

160
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,770
while doing quite a good job and no it
wasn't but

161
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,709
possible to express it very only 12 some
some some enormous age all

162
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,589
on the Woodbridge but on is approved but
so I'm

163
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:13,600
the may have more problems than those
who were thinking about yet so we parked

164
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:13,930
for

165
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,120
usually screen injection because it was
clearly the

166
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,839
ID No and we don't you fight a lot of of
such attacks

167
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,480
in logs most of them were

168
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,060
only arm automated expedition tools so
not

169
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,850
something really a convincing but we
called up not do that

170
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,089
most injection well white or twenty

171
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,160
we are really pop forum joe's the one
whole one spot on one

172
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,640
all I was thinking it was my breakfast
in

173
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,770
her film

174
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,410
yeah quite tricky um a sequel injection

175
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,819
but or nothing on was proven the logs
that though

176
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,709
but so there was successfully exploited
but if you go

177
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,459
deeper into the things we quadrupled my
from Konstantin egg that this amount and

178
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,020
no

179
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,350
he knows apart from the lows we could
have led to some bonus but those poor

180
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,880
souls

181
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,050
or are really you'll be no one to which
is called

182
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,150
these which is why you would never be
complete but

183
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,650
I Hafeez was clearly you will %uh in
lots of

184
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,940
this creates well committed injection in
this case so what

185
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,250
what happened at this time those a good
point for us what to try to know

186
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,569
what kind of information rules I thought
may have been

187
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:32,270
access with the store so we don't know
did the chrome version of a few

188
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,430
which was the one that position no he's
a newer version or but more powerful but

189
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,339
at this time it was the one but two and
well run it again the clay on them for

190
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,339
some time

191
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,630
so fortunately for them are didn't
manage to do

192
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,110
anything but but it was chill able to
dump the database name

193
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,579
so for us it was a kind of more being
all because we called her

194
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:58,560
okay you are the real problem weekend
gonna have the name of the database

195
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,050
saw even if a fusion don't manage to

196
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,920
rig on my on many columns nowhere
enquiries uneven few

197
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,300
you gave up after the city to watch them
we definitely hard but both

198
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,579
of for sick with rich and the poor

199
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,480
so on with all this information with the
clio became

200
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,890
for us was there is something more we
will need tool to investigate more

201
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,540
seeing

202
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,180
so are you don't have much time on we
also

203
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,980
we we need more access on what side
because we need

204
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,410
whom to north with the suitable names to
across from

205
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,339
summary earth um frenchmen Pro is we
don't you by wears a

206
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,040
like may have a pure so clearly was okay
give us a person wanted

207
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,329
and we we access the so confirming that
woman whose vision baby's

208
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,730
so no we win your the table names on
them

209
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,630
that these names are Sin City feel and
we call them

210
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,400
men aged 12 more find some queries and
it was more

211
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,689
of much custom in a few things we
quickly enough to fight

212
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:06,500
you want that which this time
unfortunately for the clown

213
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,730
was a real at like militias attacks

214
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,230
then any successful attacks so we called

215
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,560
above seen some and most nine which
should release all

216
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,370
showed that of the play also have been
hacked

217
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,660
then in fact more stable where remote

218
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,750
don't it was possible to collect or
crista moore

219
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,199
are email addresses and them much much
more than and so on

220
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,319
so I P we initiated about was

221
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:39,709
the in Iran I you don't offer any
publicly available services it was more

222
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:40,150
probably

223
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,160
just a simple ball to hide to her but
her home

224
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,270
anonymity

225
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,880
so what what's next arm took that as a
prime

226
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,959
maybe it was that the playoffs arm or
okay yeah

227
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,160
most of the parts used is worn self-made
call but he also relied on drama

228
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,060
which is not so may be the first choice
to or some sensitive data

229
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,620
for a forex trading company but the
problem was not in juneau because for

230
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,400
the study

231
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,480
time to my was are pretty well secured
it was but for everything in there is no

232
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,060
problem when do not

233
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,029
the Prem was been one of the commercial
plugin

234
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,110
for unfortunately the play on page babe
to have something which was professional

235
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,189
and it'd be a star model even bought a
whole rated

236
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:29,069
if each 404 few more to NoHo the

237
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,380
can be read but this model is quite
famous no

238
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,589
in the secret images for Joomla
basically

239
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,709
its just the a it's your musician and
that it seeks and URL

240
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:43,029
re-writing which by means who basically

241
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,270
provoked lot of about that such as
flooding in the surface and

242
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,819
going off of nasty things but
unfortunately

243
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,300
it was no this module which permitted
someone

244
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,360
inject so that won't seek will cause so
in that particular case

245
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,420
the secret mother brought integrity to
the claim

246
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,449
so let go deeper

247
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,990
the sequel injection was indeed a little
bit tricky to exploit

248
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,040
and the point are you you but that there
were no possibility

249
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,780
to exploited automatically that means
that we have lots

250
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,669
all the committee Porsche Cumnor all but
sequin injection in weather what

251
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,650
expedition

252
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,939
and no love them was able to even detect
anything wrong

253
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:29,380
that mean that it was not from just
script

254
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,850
yet that we we don't know what to do
tonight then run something

255
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,579
and and get a shot into something know
it was

256
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,209
ready most probably just a targeted
attack made by someone who

257
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:44,559
one hot time proposes into really are
really hot from financial

258
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:51,120
arm wait for to proceed

259
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,610
was a proof-of-concept we are we are the
always though

260
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,740
walls or promotion for nobility and we
are we crafted authored

261
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,240
by 12 are you are L which as a poke

262
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,319
demonstrated to the play on that we can
basically

263
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,799
take control of the war back in the
public those are supportive but a bit

264
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,020
%uh you arm

265
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,439
to the queries and we will go into
detail

266
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,650
with you each of them just make them
shops

267
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,870
reminder on sequins action

268
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,520
so what is what is Mike's the from a
technical point of view

269
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,809
sequel injection you that or information
leakage in this case

270
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:32,809
ok good in the paper bar on the internet
bozo its not so

271
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:38,260
usual the first career nothing really so
you should just be daunted by the PSP in

272
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,990
joint which by me to our

273
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,100
to think about more specialized the Lord
for

274
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,140
for to be callum mecham of

275
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,750
each be next request

276
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,860
on just permits which reviews in a min
but the biz name

277
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,549
quite the beginning of such an attack

278
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,160
three following requests me to leave
that the bases

279
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,640
with are 3 at the busiest the first one
you permission shimon

280
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,400
you that we only have two real databases
on this prediction sever

281
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,579
because the next worry %um a hot

282
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,839
in Eureka a new resort you can see that
cyst on Armada for folks like them

283
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,780
that means that there where only three
but the base

284
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,620
on though the the database management
system

285
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,820
so to make that request permitted to
work with them

286
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,400
though machine I'd want what back tables

287
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,559
and us when ours we have tables it was
possible to

288
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,490
enumerate the boers and basically in the
heavens request win a red

289
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,140
all the columns from a specific tables
which was interesting because we don't

290
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,390
you just about privacy

291
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,790
and the last one was a real the old we
can dump

292
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,990
recalled their record all sensitive that
are

293
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,559
good rewarding to pray that the for the
user

294
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:04,020
the forex trading system so we can we
could collect unnamed female

295
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,400
the harsh bus water and so on soul

296
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,559
right after work committee this kind of
love

297
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,630
of Bay laws author and no and we wish on
but

298
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,240
was though quickly a possible to with
them

299
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,640
or personal but are although customers
of

300
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,460
all claims

301
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,820
so the good things 10 there is some good
thing for me at this time for him

302
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,880
is that since %uh vision 15 but
something up two Mar

303
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,429
on possible partial of started that mean
that so

304
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,980
become not yarn get to the bus while the
way you would when you can provide a

305
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,679
system and

306
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,030
only have the harsh about being

307
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,350
is but so one I called on you wanna call
Tim

308
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,640
all a call that would've don't arm

309
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,740
you don't up in fact most probably
because it was a pen holder called

310
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,830
which was used by you or by a concert on
its

311
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,840
revealed after that and the any was
created that with an audition on lobby

312
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,980
for migrations in like on was never
updated with pics fortune and so on

313
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,990
but that mean that unfortunately for
them

314
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,160
their West one icons an enemies but over
called

315
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,789
which are no such a bus toward and the
which would be breaking the first second

316
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:25,470
and its Tiffany Porter noted that we of
the Wii of two lot of will

317
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,530
are this time we're still using the name
of the all the wife of the bottom of the

318
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:29,960
bed

319
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,120
in bus what so it's a financial training
institution their external consultants

320
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,530
and you can see it as a possible was

321
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,250
Julia so so play on himself

322
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,530
you don't have any problem with his home
for you or password well

323
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,650
quite strong and we didn't manage to
break them with bleach and I read that

324
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,990
for them so the only one would point for
him

325
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,830
you both arm just was not made publicly
available because the Tigers

326
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,280
didn't do not use these I called to
break anything

327
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,730
maybe did not notice on the don't want
it what that difficult

328
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,410
but maybe also it was just because even
you the

329
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,289
so with maybe he just didn't want to
won't break anything because it would've

330
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:11,760
been called a predictive

331
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,350
as you wish on the storm when when all
the puzzle will be clear

332
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,679
with this will affect for

333
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,679
for here are just a poker was a
possibles on where more

334
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,940
protected

335
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,010
and that's it for the clamps on may
eleventh

336
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,169
so are no we are the biggest part which
is a meta-analysis

337
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,169
the only women in public with are wants
to focus

338
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,950
on the if I which was embedded important
for the fake mean

339
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,570
but everybody quit have received

340
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,130
so there were several emails which were
sent with different

341
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,250
differ on something I want act different
social engineering

342
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,169
modules in fact but so or to give was
the same vision

343
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:02,760
PDF why PDF because

344
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,179
its feel today is a must provide meet up
for remote expedition

345
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,400
everybody use PDF while companies or
perimeter five-year-olds

346
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,419
are clearly put the rice PDF to prevail

347
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:17,100
and it's widely used for drive-by don't
know the road bike but the shimon

348
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,020
website

349
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,850
would you descend from social
engineering you may we such attachments

350
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,450
or

351
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,590
by the CLI yeah your you must

352
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,870
few PDF today and probably tomorrow

353
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,039
in last point is that it's really hard
for on viruses to investigate

354
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,280
PDF to the FR are really different from

355
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,400
predictable Beanery fight and no so

356
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,130
that for the change for onto the issue
for the next year

357
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,169
for example a last year the 9th October

358
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,460
I'll there was only four onto viruses

359
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,240
on 43 that the dick the potential threat
in disbelief

360
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,549
that mean a really role detection rate
of about 9 percent

361
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:01,890
and more also to so that the Bulls your

362
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,070
so much time later we still have

363
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,549
avoid detection rate of about 37 percent

364
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:13,580
despite the time but wanted a refund or
something have portability national

365
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,770
symbol seen

366
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,970
so by the CLI very dangerous white

367
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,270
fault because a PDF booster box but the
impression for months which

368
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,929
in different ways to stop but I'll which
mean the front with a biscuit called

369
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:29,120
it also supports encryption that simply

370
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,280
the prosecution's follow from

371
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,990
this report ago this month for Muni call
from shot called

372
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,220
wasn't all the things which may help
someone to hide something

373
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,080
the of some logic to swim which may be
quite tree keep on the stone

374
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,289
and make them eat to store although
object each of them campus will stop

375
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:47,730
some

376
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,880
all the time the 10 the child
ActionScript sproule

377
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,960
are flash but on for example so
basically

378
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,610
are you can you can have a lot of things
and a lot of thing with PDF

379
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,929
in this case this PDF on North was

380
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,340
0 they are like it relied on the
specific so

381
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,210
reliability that will Vancouver no own
which

382
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,470
basically limited to inject called in
all vision

383
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,770
of for I double programs into version on
mine before

384
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,159
which only was made publicly available
are

385
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,409
the 5th of October that mean that
everybody will have received the mail

386
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:33,000
most probably I've think they could
called with 0 even noticing anything

387
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,340
so the beginning and is just kind of ran
six is to

388
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,740
just over a quick and easy of what's
happened in the PDF

389
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,020
so we the people at you faded for
example you can search for risk you what

390
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,800
here we come see several interesting
things you can see that theory from in

391
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,130
embedded JavaScript with ultimately
depictions

392
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,240
perform at the beginning but as a PDF
from the interpretation

393
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,750
you can see that there is some okra to
of inference in question is right

394
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,150
looking month seems too often think the
Rugby edges which is not so usual

395
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,310
in the malicious PDF crafted fine but it
was a false positive

396
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:15,870
you the file also damaged or on but in
fact you were thinking

397
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,990
lot of things which were not true

398
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,230
and no in a quote form which can also

399
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,920
be used as a trigger point to get
something

400
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,740
going through next week next step is to
look at so isn't Robbie

401
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,950
Sandra B basically you cannot use but

402
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,240
look at the entropy is a the entropy
inside stream

403
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,210
are really near from so much of 8 which
would up suggested

404
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,620
a quite normal PDF but if your local
store the

405
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,480
contribute outside stream and the
quantity of bite

406
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,320
which are after the last and a fight i'd

407
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,160
which is not so all in all 14 for for
such a time

408
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,360
then you will are lead to another
conclusion is that

409
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,940
I love them a lead just thing that's
month form pdf

410
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,700
and I thought was most probably I did
out um

411
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,960
without stream object outside

412
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,730
so was a kid I thought and it was true

413
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,480
in fact the fight what's what that means
that you you wanted to open the lies a

414
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,260
deeper with

415
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,490
for example a while Joe which is a key
of or gimme

416
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,860
night French door a basically it cannot
do anything it

417
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,870
justly the meat warrant where

418
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,130
the play on Friday the Markham ont was
the same the same problem

419
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,850
Mar would of bought him some things but
by the clean not use them

420
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,090
in fact even if you use it with some
version of other breed of the

421
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,730
at the real problem they've was
rebuilding the fight because he was

422
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,260
thinking

423
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,660
eat was to me unfortunately it was
damaged in a specific way that

424
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,670
only team was about ripples through
everything

425
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,390
and will be born in fact so

426
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:00,730
from a broad technical issue again
everything is really really really nice

427
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,640
budget and flow on could be easily
identified without any problem

428
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,130
but despite we Weston not about extra
JavaScript

429
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,410
for sure on we try to do it manually
without

430
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,320
for specific you world we don't if I
Siro objects sry in

431
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,820
savon 30 which will remain was a trigger
for

432
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,970
the divers both but all of them was
quite sophisticated

433
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,150
we don't management from what was it
somewhat on

434
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,190
wife Nancy by them one by

435
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,470
because what you must know is usual PDF
attacks today

436
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,270
I cause generally obfuscates think
that's clear but though they do with no

437
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,820
quite predictable way in fact that often
used a simple tweeks

438
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,650
all a resume with only one bike lanes
not cool

439
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,520
to hide something and the mayor also
proceed with some more

440
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,120
rotation on lehrer position right the
British inspiration

441
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,030
but it basically maybe complex when a
nice but basically its own right on

442
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,380
those

443
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,030
to operations so in most cases you can
just do an incall

444
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,309
they are up from if the month and you
can know

445
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:12,640
just steps from specific you want
achieve HDB

446
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,160
which most often I use nicks but connect
website in the lib something

447
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,480
but here nothing up on

448
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,320
the only one solution at this time the
lost reverse engineer

449
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,410
everything so it's about we have no
choice

450
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,670
so Mon week with nothing but what is it
about this conduct so was a thick enough

451
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,610
to sober house of investigation because
our

452
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,370
we do not know with everything well
where we have where in

453
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,350
Inc which is fine but the after the late
in the crib do some things we r

454
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,290
with jealousy really nice and reducing

455
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,380
some because we have led from come in
from the right

456
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,040
well to open to someone but the key was
but we cannot just

457
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,450
from annex okie on for what more
compatible because

458
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,670
use decryption mom for by X okie

459
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,870
so us well as we had a few

460
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,320
I it was a this kind of small victory
because were

461
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,350
know with who we could have done some
research more

462
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,480
mostly for example we were able to
extract

463
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,559
of self some and summer the road which
was somewhat

464
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,450
which was embedded into the PDF file
which was the possible before

465
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,860
it was the me up unified which was baby
booties

466
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,260
opposite sex but better this fine
fortunately for us

467
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,559
was not encryption and no week will %uh
get more information without taking

468
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,520
toward a school

469
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,260
buoyant war on corruption or even know
skip

470
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,860
it was not and quickly than week will up
them some strings

471
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,320
but with you later because they will be
used little thank you was quite complex

472
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,730
enough

473
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,160
more more che so what's up on exactly
what for the for the trigger

474
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,200
by the CLI it was a good idea which was
abuse by your

475
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,500
i the breather and which love which are
dawn

476
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,300
a string got on a unique name failed
from the think they were

477
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,780
it well this vulnerability in you

478
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,340
so again stand-up shows the way you can
see but the CLI

479
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,790
where ok you're um

480
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,300
here we have the call to the function
which room which called those in the

481
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,290
fourth floor

482
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,860
you after preparation 2.2 a few love the
same table

483
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,920
and nobody you know dddd yuav

484
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,410
victory for more from Michael

485
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,410
your justice more room to sure

486
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,980
debugging mode what's happened when
you're when you try to crush in

487
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,430
really whole room before input with
hateful before

488
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,809
so let's summarize what we know until no
we had some

489
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:54,550
across from JavaScript which detected we
do not see differently but

490
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,670
the call was very professional with
others have a script which the Kiwi

491
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,470
division of

492
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,570
i the breather was used in with jump
specific called

493
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,280
after that with other news spread with
puts larue but I

494
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,510
memory so it was a return or to
programming exploit

495
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,860
hopes by the Glee we also are typically
good red sled which

496
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,559
acted as a nub lead for quality between
the like before before when the rope

497
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,340
year old I'm going to

498
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,270
for the can come to the right no a what
your interest in with discuss

499
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,620
you universal slides is that so we is a
he's

500
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,850
I you see in the media was used because
it's

501
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,290
not in isola enabled the NL an awful lot
of

502
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,809
nasty thing for kids so basically

503
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:42,710
other girls use a rub techniques on
redirect brought though

504
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,790
to some code section word lol instead of
the heap

505
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,660
and no permitted them to love the kitty
right

506
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,820
so basically the chain from portland is
delta pride have battled

507
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,990
ends the also used a really nice trick
which was never see in the lobby for

508
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,370
one month before on on the white for
example the US for example

509
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,750
as a question of for

510
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,600
an empty file it somewhere we just
permitted

511
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,260
to be much memory can benefit from an
executable

512
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,780
tablespace for example me will up enable
them

513
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,830
shut by then executed even on the on the
that penny but system

514
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,680
so let's talk about the I see with the
India

515
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,340
34 because its life know it's the
something which is quite famous scenes

516
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,670
expert development on the world
community but at this time

517
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,860
while was fun and Mike so basically

518
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,310
it's a deal which is not compete with s
are

519
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,520
and therefore is always but at the same
place on your system

520
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,400
so basically if a program managed to
avoid it he's able to buy

521
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,680
the by the import address table of these
I with

522
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,760
in the city for the NL to predict all a

523
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,260
a celeb IP address of the system so

524
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,890
lookouts program was able to or bypass
that

525
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,570
was able to bypass so address space
layout randomization

526
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,800
and a in our students within XP

527
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,340
up but it is called those who work on
Windows Vista and Windows 7

528
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,190
already in my six but so yes

529
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,340
ready for the playoffs it was game over
so

530
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,060
everything was gone all hole is playing
would love it executive

531
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,360
any time of st. think and you know

532
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,490
just a few things but is there is some
some tricky thing from IQ which

533
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:31,970
prevented

534
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,620
us to this is I cuz they don't want us
to

535
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,210
with allies everything so that puts lot
of things to prevent to

536
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,510
to make online much other than I must
say that the succeeded in some ways

537
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:48,870
so for example a we don't we were never
able to exploit the memory breakpoint

538
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,450
each type

539
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,710
each time we use them or break both
which would have been really useful

540
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,190
because

541
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,260
it was unpacking himself on some but the
memory so it was really nice for us to

542
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:57,670
use it

543
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,290
but each time you summary but point main
were right in

544
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,910
long group gobble wobble whole but at
the time of the loop

545
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,930
the pons the time depended but at the
time its throws an exception

546
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:14,000
and we wake him up soul we also noticed
but firm

547
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,790
but Samir they'll fight at those at a
some points overwrought

548
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,960
won't take fiction I love why

549
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,310
because you must I wanted at some point
was that of

550
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,120
these titles are really disturbing me I
hope I don't wanna live

551
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,890
every encryption systems leads with I
will runs a

552
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,150
everything and they will itouch with the
for example lot P

553
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,910
and they will dump what's burning in
memory which already and printed by the

554
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,390
process

555
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,610
mapping and I we get everything for free
so basically if you wanted to do this

556
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,370
mean you could not because should be at
which time to

557
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,410
attached a input them who love just

558
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:55,690
dump just probably think and other trade
while but

559
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,190
or his was this program of his some

560
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,320
person or persons name and for example
%uh

561
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,670
if you just runner-up Rocco a prop on
with you

562
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,929
on real name your your %uh you alright
to differ on

563
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,350
different things but and nearly nothing
with you

564
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,419
%uh to remains a problem on to be able
to make a quick

565
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:20,300
up your amenities with also things we
discovered yesterday

566
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,129
when we we we will see the video was a
friend of mine Brian

567
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:28,409
collected into the room and gently
propose me to make this more your

568
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:28,850
obvious

569
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,810
things school to show you something I've
and when I was finishing my flight yeah

570
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,530
but you don't think with her for the
night and no so basically

571
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,560
we discover all the things that we have
not in pool but

572
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,580
there are some onto debugging techniques
which well

573
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,020
a by the keys a metal Manuel was
triggering the frontcourt if you read it

574
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,620
and start the VMware for example

575
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,929
which sweetened demonstration 45

576
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:58,500
by Mon short force that unfortunately
we're thinking

577
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,950
yes we are end of the fight we know
everything we

578
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,790
everything will be quick will be done
quickly no no no it's but not finished

579
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,480
we detected although been a wreath

580
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,570
at the one binary which was not created
to run

581
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:15,280
the m1 for example but so you can see
everything quickly

582
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,620
this other won't be very was returned no

583
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,109
by of the identified this one was not
encrypt see that or so

584
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:26,220
it was a drop of oil called of dump some

585
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,930
our city a clear take from it for sure
who would have been

586
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,510
Patrik because her at this point we
denounce trust anything

587
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,960
but well it was not a tree you can see
the great file what fry

588
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,050
with Demi 2012 right to stream you can
see some heavy which

589
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,120
I'll you connect for and a remote system
to them or something

590
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,550
by the code that was another this was
also called him with a BA villages where

591
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,240
you can see

592
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,550
we've we've bought a rogue DNS services
project traffic wanna for several

593
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,970
and therefore we can reach one of a
computer and no

594
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,990
with government is quite quickly but so
was a problem try to do not have the

595
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,760
dude with big

596
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,840
on on though on the website which was
bringing home your

597
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,560
Jordan make a smile

598
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,990
and at this time he would harm the final
payload of

599
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,870
all these nasty things while still don't
know that knows the executable

600
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,150
a big with every which was in fact a

601
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,550
patrolled on banking program based on
this by high theory

602
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,570
from by with no sayings but was made on
this one

603
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,350
so let's summarize the reason because
it's so we have gone quite the panel

604
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,350
by just burning bone just a simple

605
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:44,690
PDF file in this ocean engineering email
play on of

606
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,800
generated without mercy noticing its a
me up a bit and find which was

607
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,870
injected process memory of several

608
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,990
systems and now which in so executive

609
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,430
a dropper done with it negative dropper

610
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,270
a the mother the one which downloaded
from bringing home Jordan

611
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,830
and also final panel which was a bit too
which in turn was

612
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,230
copied into the propagation with the
signatures from the mines name

613
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,840
and watch run into memory this was the
final him

614
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,980
of I think it's the thought

615
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,530
what happened on those two you fight
other what fights

616
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,960
was just simple other not been gritted

617
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,500
the phone once the last fight was ac-
shop based in every

618
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,560
you would really review shop they

619
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,810
and despite was issued shop it was not
possible to

620
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,600
to obtain the original code with from a
committee to when I that it was

621
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,440
much more even much more productive than
the for this but which was also quite

622
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,680
but the

623
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,880
so it's a relied on base people for that
are md5 to build this

624
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,690
a as not often questionable reasons
which are not so

625
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,970
bookable sweetie

626
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,210
and allspice am fortunate to work
undetected by most anti viruses

627
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,580
only a few or European solutions

628
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,300
whether the Kings somethings a missiles
pool 5

629
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,870
all on severity from the if countries
were quite inefficient

630
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,100
which lead us to sing but it's only a
theory

631
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,380
its this was thing but it was initially
an attack which one

632
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,460
aim to targets the Russian segment
because

633
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,340
I cures specializing called a bit from
specific protection depending on what

634
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,040
they want but I

635
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,609
so but the key differ on dates and
defraud presence

636
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:33,200
%uh 8 September on E 30 seven best
something detection rate for those

637
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,330
memories

638
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,630
and a one week later forty-four percent
after we have pushed a lot of thing that

639
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,490
was important but before

640
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,810
offenders but this year in June I

641
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,270
you we you I'd still want on ferries on
five with them

642
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,460
the kinesin wheels when not

643
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,390
look maybe is a expert you want home
because we we are more

644
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,960
we have a Microsoft also put my cup in
diff --git

645
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,530
and alza controversies which are famous
do that also postpone our

646
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,030
when's the next week or so arrive 10
week ago

647
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,130
ima all the controversies wants to
remain

648
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,330
not sufficient for the final bill or the
I thought you was a spy highs the

649
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,020
ripcord

650
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,090
I'll be able like the board you know it
basically try to

651
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,210
still sensitive financial institution
but it kept the

652
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,740
that I and in for free provide all all
the features

653
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,050
of for up for another

654
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,450
so we don't go into the details details
but basically it creates all the fires

655
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,320
um in in its it injects are

656
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,589
use orange drop files into all the
memory space to

657
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:46,270
benefits from privilege problems its
beats play with registry to making so by

658
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,150
both

659
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,650
you verify that it was called and the
from specific bar

660
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,190
all but was a been there exists a risky
register key be there is common practice

661
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,210
is to disturb

662
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,060
reverse engineering idk worries that
they say

663
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,480
and who to get the complete domain in a
to do be every bit very beginning

664
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,620
a least those award at drive on

665
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,780
the puzzle the wolf although 5

666
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,320
no in integrate and uses result remotely

667
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,570
so also or some someone north's
well-known give your for such

668
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,670
forum n fairly

669
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,460
he tried to reach no to web server
Austin Korea

670
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,700
we also find some Unicode encoding in
the labyrinth

671
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,240
which seems who demonstrate that what
and got really

672
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,950
Grove don't in korea on those laws

673
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,960
web some okay would go

674
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,510
Lucy later right now we are just at the
beginning of the

675
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,839
transmitting hd2 several tool to see
what would have happened without making

676
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,420
all for uncommitted with the real what
other because we wanted to remain low

677
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,440
profile and you don't

678
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,800
for wanting to detectors so we can up
the keys is all

679
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,440
so hello hi I'm here from from the trial
run which bar trying to communicate with

680
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,109
the motel

681
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:09,839
and basically the first trial was
nothing it was just forwarding them see

682
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,400
it was just watching or buckets someone
just in case

683
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,210
authorities would've managed to take on
the web server

684
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,730
it would have been quite easily to our
just continue to keep

685
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,890
musty think those domains

686
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:29,240
deeds existence really long time since
94 for the Force One

687
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,270
it was really ahold or bombing and

688
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,250
of the lot lot lot not of website one of
them was nothing more than

689
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,980
160 the 1600 the flip side

690
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,870
for YouTube possibilities for
compromising

691
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,400
around despite its perimeter sweet
effectively sounds like you

692
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,670
the beach where will you can see you
goes on a Mon you

693
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,890
wind which Israeli you not really good
for you %uh

694
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,910
website itself also was was quite dull

695
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,260
would night 19 job because if you look
like this

696
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,680
who doesn't look like so a compromise

697
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,880
that would like to a remote C&C server
but it was a covert channel

698
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,940
to investigate and by get you can see
that there was some heat on way to

699
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,490
communicate and that there is something
which one month's papal

700
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,960
so that'd weapons a conclusion

701
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,380
finally the target was not well as a
client

702
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,850
that was a full the fate of putting you
know playoff itself was you

703
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:32,580
own customers for truth also impacted
the fifth or trading system

704
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:37,850
but but owns is own website was
compromised everything popular really

705
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,570
really really quickly that mean that
everything was

706
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,400
achieve in ready to use and that was the
real trio was

707
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,880
by the way to compromise and gets mad
with a

708
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,120
a swimmer has the collected email
address everything ok with the same day

709
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,370
that mean that it was well organized
system

710
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,620
and a bicycling know it was

711
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,589
a it was a real my sophisticated attacks
which was

712
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:10,060
up before the the by a on in for
compatible another trading company for

713
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,320
international companies

714
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,089
cool with it she died we decided to what
I to with you

715
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:18,680
and we'll rent services and and the
broad-market because that too because a

716
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,600
point here

717
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,660
I just want to on the line what some
Nicole on said yesterday

718
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,250
one of was a new rules of the games you
that we have

719
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,280
some specialized attacks of and that the
I can

720
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,040
have become professional and that the
case here

721
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,280
is superficial if you look got a buddy
we r my way to dredging Williams

722
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,680
with different cause because the front
along wages programming

723
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,260
%uh differ on skills but we have the
front could offer

724
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,839
dropping for the mother for the banking
for them we of them the other in

725
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:49,650
covering

726
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,540
we absentia engineering was your which
looks suspiciously we have web pics

727
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,589
which was a really

728
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:59,750
also might affect and we must also have
some on its roster options this kind of

729
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,960
nasty things beyond

730
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,830
on the market in fact really more than
San OU I thought

731
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,650
where a every I king group I specialize
in 20 are

732
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,790
into the right services in red services
to other groups

733
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,850
and the and rely on $30 from all those
who can not on thousandth

734
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:19,560
as if group with a wooden be knowing but
wats shows a group

735
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,940
basically its a real onto price and I'll

736
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,400
are that walks are or your company's

737
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,560
for fortune there aren't many business
opportunities

738
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,230
come from many other countries most
active of for for China Russia and

739
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,510
abroad in but

740
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,060
not limited to those countries thought
was the last night is that

741
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,780
to conclude there is much less backing
for fun and much more packing for profit

742
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,350
Abercrombie as evolve and are no their
its

743
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,650
does become and award enterprise with a
huge

744
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,770
economy I'm if you want food coma but by
tomorrow you don't

745
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,940
I even to all to make on call you can
read but mezzo

746
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,310
of a one-hour a powerful one way are you
can well you can purchase a light since

747
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:03,970
my where

748
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,980
which come with own technical support

749
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,490
so basically here it's really amazing
federal crime as not develop

750
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:15,120
in what any spreading faster than ever
so welcome in the world Wide Web

751
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,109
and I before I think for for the
following you right now we have

752
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:23,480
and thing fall for whole I don't know if
we have time

753
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:30,480
before oh yes just five minutes affected
the thing for the demonstration

754
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:38,560
for period would be more from Caracas

755
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,310
some would okay so just run you're the
mother

756
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:47,900
from the burger run a cruel now these
are the two because we don't want war

757
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,040
cool reader 100000 line of assembly so
we first runs the deboers owns

758
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,990
as a PDF from the ring program then

759
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,340
we open we simulate opening of the final
just two

760
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,620
deeper no in your family

761
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,570
and then we just we remove one bright
one break point we only

762
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,530
let one break point more than three kept
spring cut operations upon type remember

763
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,910
saw no no

764
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,690
we will be able to open to runs a
program into a plan to fight for

765
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:28,980
for real let's play we opened definitely

766
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,230
depicted year we have the rebuilding
process

767
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:37,450
from and old fashioned a father in they
are we break

768
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,760
will broke before displaying anything in
the PDF and no

769
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,030
We Heart we can process nearly
everything because as

770
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,010
as you remember there is also some
panels of onto the begin picking

771
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,720
and at one point you will see that we
are volume immunity which is running

772
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,670
into any

773
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,520
you will not finish something but we
know will proceed was in a way

774
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,490
so we broke we of the Spring Cup you can
see

775
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,510
on the start that something nasty will
happen

776
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:13,290
will over or something write something
no we just make a break bones on the

777
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,810
on the final down the line you know in
the quill type which we score

778
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,820
or use the pointer forty-eight address
basically will

779
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,580
its the beginning objects but I'm

780
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,820
the ICU see the yen that the

781
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,630
something here that you have on this
custom for the

782
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:39,520
if the bypass and just before

783
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,580
are returning we can see on the start on
that

784
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,580
has a real some lot of for miss dissing
forty-one

785
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,600
Sony translated on by you and being

786
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,750
think of something that mumble something
really harmful for

787
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:58,750
from the sure pillow perspective

788
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,440
and he'll we of a lot tougher rate we
will procure

789
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,170
soldiers go back at the end of a start
because we don't want halftime

790
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:14,370
full trade which no she's right through
the forest just would justify

791
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,840
some course

792
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,560
net dress where we can modify of like
pointer

793
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,260
would just to goal with the for only two
in the time

794
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,280
we modify of like pointer with this
address

795
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,490
because basically with a with the robot
IQ your your pope

796
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,530
on the return address which is on the
stock in each time you will return will

797
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,460
return the goods

798
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:45,210
some some pop up from the Schuylkill so
here you are the robot that

799
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,130
with not with the crate by which will
cure

800
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,530
so can see the bottom

801
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,530
to sub on break point which is what's on
break point on credit 5

802
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,180
with I W just on break point spread my
file mapping

803
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,070
to to make some break and then we'll see
something that we will not have the time

804
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,460
to seeing know the reason

805
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,460
cream making hay

806
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,530
the last 10 with your fine

807
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,670
so let's run

808
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,620
it will broke with broken quit I'll hop
they

809
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,330
quite fine W quit making five

810
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:36,960
it might be five I may be fake a so here
was a key

811
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,150
we brought we you can you can see all
that we discussed

812
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,300
with ICU with my king of these a file

813
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,800
here you up extraction of the medial
I'll in time for the

814
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,540
which was they were talking about for
long

815
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:56,430
by we r mmm

816
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:00,100
know we will just with I'll a small but
want more

817
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,770
on Lord library to we'll see when these
from st. there will

818
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:10,770
you know the the important about 30 per
space

819
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:20,460
here we are

820
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,440
and he will bro in to read from

821
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,950
and we know these you know fine

822
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,119
so let's see the process

823
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,730
show you everything we have no to me at
the unified

824
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:43,410
which is here at the bottom of the
screen RightNow

825
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,840
doable of get any at the one but

826
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,030
a and we don't have one because it
wanted his execution

827
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,760
the the is clever guy we see that we are
reading

828
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,500
a month ago we have tried to with the
for Heidelberg

829
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,440
plugins kind of things to hide the
Heidelberg

830
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,880
on all we've been tough we don't have
time for today to

831
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,440
detect work exactly it wasn't but too
good to see you

832
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,810
you a double to at the hem we arrive in
the hiz gauge

833
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:18,500
the justification look and basically
program will do all the things and he

834
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,320
will not finish

835
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,590
so OK just disclosed are

836
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:26,740
at this time zone the burger and in
Finnish to

837
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,760
Lord the repeat if both also from the
bid you and

838
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,670
you we did think there is no the burger
a test women we finish

839
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:41,310
to walk for us

840
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,730
in

841
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:46,880
first we just ran a small script which
will

842
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,420
I was as you can see two different steps
I just one minute

843
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:54,880
finished we just removed every pump re5

844
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,740
with but then you botch long to continue
with them

845
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,960
the demonstration from you

846
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,000
shows so

847
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,490
here you are we are ready for continuing
everything is clear from the

848
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,700
the point of view there is still no %uh
the one

849
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:16,670
Beanery just remove not by the

850
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,829
forgot and kill madame which

851
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:22,980
was a mini program memory and no

852
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:29,170
upon

853
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:34,430
burns's much to PDF directly we have
just were directed the traffic into all

854
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,670
on web server because we do not want to
do more than the program

855
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,000
but as well and not available yet from
on this %um

856
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,790
so that's a lot to the public on it

857
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,720
and while its opening you up yeah

858
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,480
we r that you love it's as though its
free to figure out where and with who

859
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,730
were

860
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,270
which wasn't no the you know what
formative

861
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:59,440
though that'd thanks for all

862
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,230
positive things is called thanks my
friend for the video and

863
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,740
I think everything is not I'm up we
don't have main pipe a question but

864
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,790
for sure on you can reach us by mail you
can this

865
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,910
we can discuss the maybe a be restored

866
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:17,510
slowly but maybe with a parade for nynex
from a problem so thank you
