1
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,170
yeah discern

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,970
forty-five minutes it's everything about
to fear uncertainty and banking

3
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,820
credentials

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,840
why I have chosen that title a willow

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,860
quickly learn or see and

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:35,860
if I put it on it will in were or not

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,320
I just replace it by your other one

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,320
and it installs to drivers device driver
software until 10 lichen

9
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,339
use tomorrow's okay my name's a generous
man

10
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,650
I'm working for a Swiss financial
institute and

11
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,950
I'm working their son I to security
officer so I'm

12
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,770
to pester to annoy at two to help make
them to the system or securities

13
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,119
just my a.m. normal day work just as a
disclaimer at the beginning

14
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,880
a.m. as a set I work for a financial
institute

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,970
so everything I say here is my own
opinion

16
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,300
does not necessarily reflect the opinion
of me employees here

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,880
a.m. all the credential type same
talking about the only man

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,300
asa example some no specific to

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,869
products so yes term

20
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:53,390
about the motivation I started Torre why
AM

21
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,210
wanted to give to talk there was a a TV

22
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,619
show in the swiss TV the some time ago

23
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,710
Boat of the Year something and they
thought that would be probably a good

24
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,030
idea to just talk about

25
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,880
credentials what our day way our day
like they are

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,489
have there are two the problems we have
if those

27
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,500
and them I thought it would be good to
do some kind of taxonomy to just raised

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,410
the bar to

29
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:27,360
so that 3 a.m. have to say McAbee Larry
to talk about term

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,110
credentials I didn't know

31
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,380
put like that agenda and them

32
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,860
I was halfway through and they recognize
step to making that exxon army isn't

33
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,650
good enough

34
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,340
so I am I thought about

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,210
doing as some kind of taxonomy but then
talk about TT credentials themselves but

36
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,900
you will I notice when you're there

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,400
just as a starter

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,800
why we're we in the mess today are in
this mess today where

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,130
are we talking about credentials or yeah

40
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,540
it said probably just a quick reminder
for you it's probably nothing you

41
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,670
but the main thing is but or two main
point is

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,660
we have that the problem for our I
between bank owned it

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,860
hardware or software and privately or a
customer own

44
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,850
harder softer in a beginning their word
is a ATM's

45
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,690
or someone in the beginning there were
dis- ATM's and

46
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,420
most %uh firm or anything of this
awesome

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,800
bank owned bank decided which software
is used which hardware issues

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,530
usually the the space to rent it was
banked by

49
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,690
rented by the bank so perhaps that the
whole spectrum offer security in their

50
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,489
own hands

51
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:55,250
physical and IT security a.m.

52
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,950
someday the customer-owned computers
came into the story

53
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,370
so there was two beginning of the I'm
online banking

54
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,410
and there was some some part of the
whole

55
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,580
firm system which was ten customer-owned

56
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,090
and so to cost them at the site it

57
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,530
what top date went well update to what
are going to use a sitter

58
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,320
now with a city in getting worse early
her for some other devices which we

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,590
don't really are you still

60
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,480
the we lose them here take them with us

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,480
them it's not getting any better but
lets a set the stage so what are we

62
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,930
talking about what this into solar

63
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,880
banking or online banking part what kind
of objects are dear

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,520
I a mate on my abstraction

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,950
and you see from right to left there are
two

66
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,140
banking service like the web server to
credential server or something

67
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,120
then the fireball the internet SSM

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,630
as a clout and

69
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,820
computer owned by the customer then some
kind of credential whatever type there

70
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,229
is

71
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,360
and the user itself and for this talk

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,580
I am focusing on

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,600
leftmost part mostly because

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,360
I just said okay the serve parted banks
usually know what they do so they know

75
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,060
what they have on the service they

76
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,500
hartnett 25 almost the same its bank
owned so they usually know what they do

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,830
internet that just said okay we use SSL

78
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,710
if it's correctly used a.m. should work

79
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,950
a.m.

80
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,220
on the computer didn't want to focus
because they're all the talks a

81
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,450
focusing only on that one as so I said
okay we go to the

82
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:52,700
credentialing to use our only so I try
to make some a credential group just two

83
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,700
to have fair am to go to have some
logical groups of these different

84
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,099
credentials and a start to twittershare

85
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,740
grouping by connection first I really
tried to do some

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,400
and some grouping or some some taxonomy
which is so

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,940
which could term have every

88
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,370
every aspect of his credentials in it
and then you could to just make some

89
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,340
remarks and

90
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,860
and have fewer for for one special type
of credential

91
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,680
to have fewer a profile this stuff
unfortunately work

92
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,140
am so Mitt much this grouping a.m.

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,660
drooping by connection means the you do
you have that

94
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,340
credential plucked into your computer
that would be the rightmost so you have

95
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,610
it

96
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,699
directly connected a.m. you have it
indirectly connected like a a flickering

97
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,480
solution

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,380
they do have some some kind of
communication between the computer and

99
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,940
that device and then you have thats
disconnected state

100
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,030
where am here you have for the

101
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:06,350
some kind of a calculator valued do
something with it

102
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,389
animator the next grouping by user
interface

103
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,480
there are some components with half
which half no screen

104
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,130
I like USB sticks or something and you
have some small correct output

105
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,680
like 50 a.m. term

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,160
calculator kind of things and there are
even

107
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,060
a.m. credentials which half a screen
like a

108
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,470
mobile devices something

109
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,130
and the last grouping inmate is Sam

110
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,440
by secret sewer with what internal stuff
this credential work

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,139
the said okay we have a shared secret
like term

112
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,600
and some kind of an itan

113
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,790
list which you share it with the bank
you have for cert fickt

114
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,050
certificates based the credential

115
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,180
or mechanism and to have for one time
pat

116
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,610
pace the a.m. mechanism

117
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,940
until you cum if he is there generate
Lisa

118
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,560
one-time Pat or one type also hurt
yourself

119
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
or half it to preaching to rate it for
you

120
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,490
beta by the bank

121
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,669
so I then them took his

122
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,479
different credentials we have to add on
to market and tried to place them to

123
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:27,880
tease

124
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,969
different term a group site just made

125
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,260
and again decide just examples so we
have

126
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,550
some kind of I 10 I tried to two groups
pieced together

127
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,490
Mayfair what kind of connection does it
have it is disconnected what kind of you

128
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,949
I does it have

129
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:52,829
some kind of table a.m. on what kind of
Secrets does it work

130
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:57,020
and them what that it's Dennis what kind
of attack surface

131
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,449
does it have so them

132
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:07,449
how could it be exploited how could it
be misused by an attacker

133
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,490
therefore TEDA turn it says quite clear
you could copy it

134
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,190
there were some cases where an attack is
just asked for am

135
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,640
just send me your next 10 a chance and
their uses a truly

136
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,680
a.m. pocket their I 10 number 2

137
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,449
next 10 to arm to that Web interface

138
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:34,050
so it's it's an for social engineering
it's not foolproof as well

139
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,640
I took to ask next example I took that
USB stick

140
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,530
it said directly connected it has no UI
its certificate based

141
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,900
and the attack here is Sam

142
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,770
I guess some of you hurts that talk by
Max

143
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,170
last year you could either do a remote
USB

144
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,040
so it just kinda from a remote computer
can access that USB stick

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,400
you can that connects a.m. the

146
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,030
the smart card to be a peak it KcsA 11

147
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,959
as an attack yourself so there some way
off firm

148
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,130
exploiting that the swell

149
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,319
then it took the DM ten use the

150
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:21,730
sometimes a by two banks its indirectly
connected to have a normal screen

151
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,780
it's the one-time Pat based

152
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,810
and it's not foolproof against social NC
engineering

153
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,959
same swapping the which mean SEM

154
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,449
somebody goes to Swisscom or whichever
am I'm

155
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:39,750
service provider and asks them to
replace his SIM card which Justin

156
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,440
basically

157
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,150
basically you worse and you have 10 his
SIM cards

158
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,290
the the attacker has your SIM card

159
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,920
and Canton receive fewer SMS's so

160
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,459
that again isn't foolproof as well
terrorists

161
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:57,459
again the somatic lecture and the

162
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,209
the last one I at it is a certificate
spaced

163
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:05,100
challenge response so that this a.m

164
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,360
indirectly connected as well you have a
normal screen

165
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,920
a.m. it has a certificate that's the
secret

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,149
ante at Tech surface here again is says
social engineering

167
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,339
or can be social engineering

168
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,200
and them this is nothing really new I
guess

169
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,089
so I am a took another step analyzed
this the different situations

170
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,490
and quickly noticed all of this

171
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,010
half either direct communication which
means

172
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,370
an its it uses the same communication
channels

173
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,680
that that the normal banking session
takes

174
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,890
are you have an indirect communication
like

175
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,360
TDM 10 but again you have tats
communication somehow

176
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,959
aunt a.m. that best %uh Fallis

177
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,190
the banks usually don't have to direct
connection

178
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,500
to decrease central and if they have

179
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,370
its usually not mutual so

180
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,920
did the endpoint of the SSL usually is
not

181
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,779
that trust device after of the bank it's
the computer

182
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,730
and so I am just another quick reminder

183
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,100
a.m. the computer is not bank account

184
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,580
to use other computers customer-owned so
there's no chance for the bank

185
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,690
to enforce any policies to to make sure
it's patched

186
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,680
it s their hardware you want to order
bank wants to have et cetera

187
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,180
so a.m. this means Altes systems

188
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,200
half her definition to say mattox
surface or

189
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
a similar attack surface and

190
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,660
a.m. at least on a higher level

191
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,100
and which means if if you have no trust
dense point

192
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,899
you have no 100 percent security
protection you can't have to

193
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:03,640
which probably comes quite a surprise
for all of you

194
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,870
a.m. but the best offer

195
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,930
of of Fallis a.m.

196
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,769
there's hope aunt this is actually at
that them

197
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,620
to basic short bass part of of to talk

198
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,300
am what this the hope what what actually
should be talk about what actually is

199
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,529
that that the part we should talk about

200
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,680
its an risk

201
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,839
the risks can be a chance term at least
at this what that that the business

202
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,310
a.m. some to business always talks about

203
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,820
but what's this this what does this mean
what this

204
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,149
what's what kind to firm

205
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,510
what what does this mean for US to
customer for 42 bank

206
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,500
at the first part that like to talk
about this numbers

207
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,850
let's let's take a very simple um
calculation

208
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,200
you have certain you are banks you half
a million customers

209
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,019
or million online banking customers

210
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,990
and that this means you have a
credential you have to release

211
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,190
these or you have to and to send his
credentials out

212
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,390
to your customers a.m. just a wild guess

213
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,720
the if you take some kind of

214
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,089
hardware Tamagotchi dingy

215
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,370
it will cost you 30 dollar store Swiss
francs

216
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,310
what which only like which means if you
have a a million customers this means

217
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,540
30 million your chest have for
delivering that hardware

218
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,399
for having it the air and for some when
replacing it

219
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,690
because this heifer if their pop that
tree the run

220
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,290
and turn to don't put them into USB part

221
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,199
a.m. some went back she will be empty
which means you have to replace this

222
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,889
hardware

223
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,630
so 30 million every few years

224
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,000
and there can be quite a few fraud cases
to

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,220
2 a.m. to to have two similar

226
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,720
expenses you have so actually when
talking about the about credentials to

227
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,620
you not only talking about security
you're talking about

228
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,100
the risk country talking about money
ultimately so

229
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,569
30 million is quite big number then

230
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:27,720
them

231
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,889
of course nobody will ever

232
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,019
that talk about fraud cases but a guest
is set

233
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,839
the thirty frankfurter hardware isn't
that far away or far-fetched probably

234
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,240
with some hardware it even more and

235
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,240
them probably if you only

236
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,310
the talk about hardware costs you don't
have to help this calls

237
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,930
cost them a switch callin to ask our
it's not working

238
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,329
at the replacements you have to have two
processes you have to have internally

239
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:00,490
so am as a set

240
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,509
we talk about a number so in talking
about banking credentials

241
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:08,269
the second term

242
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:12,490
point I'd like to talk about to say
reputation

243
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,490
have you ever heard about the company

244
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,250
going tits up bankrupt because of
whatever happened to them

245
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,949
except the task now

246
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:28,850
I i'm really talking about a company
which went it up because stay a

247
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,600
at a huge fuckup of deadlock in

248
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,610
or or whatever I don't know of any

249
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,380
probably there are some but they're
quite if there are

250
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,779
term they can't be that peak so

251
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,589
all that talk about who your reputation
et cetera is

252
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,639
in my personal opinion overrated if
there's really something happening

253
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,550
is that you won't ever hear about that
or

254
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,790
from perhaps it hurts the the company

255
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,910
but after year to 34 don't know

256
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,620
that's probably a over and nobody will
ever remember it

257
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,970
when I'm 80 slight I thought about ito
ay anti-choice

258
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,630
you probably heard that story early
nineties I guess

259
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,839
that was a Tory them which is that

260
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,490
them Drupal firm to know how to call
themselves

261
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,520
just 'em artists something and that
there was the company toys

262
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,169
and that's that they want to sell at
their toys sent there was that pick a

263
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:33,840
fight

264
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,460
between each other Andy twice isn't
living anymore so am

265
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,650
that's the only company I remember it
which really went it up because stay a

266
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,340
Mehta a brown decision but it had
nothing to do with

267
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:52,340
anything security the third part this

268
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,370
well i i written their am transaction
180 ring but it goes

269
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,500
much for them the when talking about to

270
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,659
banking system our online banking the
authentication is

271
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,830
up authentication is not the only party
so

272
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,909
we're talking about we're talking about
term

273
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:15,040
transaction monitoring as on back-end
processing some

274
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,990
what not am so only because

275
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,100
the transaction RTT deadlock in

276
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,080
a.m. was cracked doesn't mean to money
is going out

277
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,649
to the to the attackers it might but
it's not does not necessarily have to do

278
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:36,640
you probably were phoned up by your
credit card company someone in your life

279
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,590
they asked you are you really sure that
you want to buy now this

280
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,409
whatever and term they actually to
exactly the same

281
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,510
as to banks are some of the banks don't
know T

282
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,690
the others and to it's just a.m.

283
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,840
having a backend process which does try
to to find out the

284
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,630
if they're attacked or not so

285
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,960
and in to talk about I was able to
execute

286
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,370
that at that location or take over that
looking for you

287
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,440
that doesn't necessarily mean to monies
away

288
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,100
and a.m. what's also appoint this a.m.

289
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,320
we need to 2 a.m. differentiates between

290
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,000
the authentication and to all dressed so
I am

291
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,480
if your authentication fails probably
have some

292
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,720
transaction signing in in the front
entry really have to sign

293
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,770
all of your transactions so it really
have to say

294
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,889
okay I wants to do with this transaction

295
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:39,990
I will come back to that in

296
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,990
a little late

297
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,440
now that on fails as well I could change
again

298
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,170
until it works again to go to this link

299
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,300
am

300
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,590
also II sets now these three points
about term

301
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,270
yet there are other systems or other
mechanisms to arm

302
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:16,140
to make a system secure and my personal
opinion is that

303
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,620
every Frank for every dollar whatever
day get

304
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,060
is set is wrong so and my personal
opinion is

305
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,320
also we do this calculation I'm also we
have to do that calculation

306
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,920
what's to do and what this a what has
the better return on your investment

307
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,120
Asian if they have get that one frank

308
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,460
day a day arm supported so today I am

309
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,860
can move on and be davilla compaq

310
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,350
when it worked once they will come back
for second time

311
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,650
and so on so I am don't let them win

312
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,470
well to points to consider

313
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,290
there is some

314
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:07,570
will this actually that's pointy

315
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,500
usability and one is

316
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,080
a.m. what actually do the USACE know
what they do

317
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,750
in

318
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,330
yes you have that their credential where
you are logged in we firm

319
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,610
graphic art you place it in some kind of
card reader

320
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,770
as you enter pin and then you get the
china's response

321
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,980
kind of the communication wish to thank

322
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,970
you lookin and everything's fine am if
you use the same deweiss

323
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:48,030
for transaction signature and the usual
use it actually has no idea what he

324
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,390
signs he can't see it

325
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,530
he has stepped Adams he will get some
kind of number

326
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,930
anything but his signs that but s no
idea what he signs

327
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,550
even if you have the

328
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,610
better or a.m. another um

329
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,400
credential an say you have for them some
kind to firm

330
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,930
display something an where you cannot
display it

331
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,090
the amount whom to pay to the

332
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,480
mmm whether use this

333
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,690
today really know what they do do they
really know

334
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,730
what they are sign to to really read it

335
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,580
a.m. if they have to do it every time
they probably just click

336
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,670
through because said they knew it from
the last three hundred times that it was

337
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,250
correct

338
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,190
why shouldn't it be correct this time
a.m.

339
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,610
there you don't have for the

340
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,460
the TV to proceed under your control it
could be

341
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,950
anything on there Miko at hats
disservice

342
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,000
example this morning probably there is
some a notice which service

343
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,110
behalf that contest send us your money
and you will win a Wii

344
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,200
and the use it then wants to submit

345
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,640
that money he really wants it thank you
will make everything

346
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,160
that the transaction will go through he
will even phone up

347
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,470
to say you stopped my transaction
transaction white

348
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,940
so even that you have transaction
signing

349
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,450
it does not necessarily have to work
because of the use is the heat

350
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,460
he isn't able to to it he cites on

351
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,260
on the information if im or his tricked
into accepted anyway

352
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,390
a.m.

353
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,350
so there's the them this seemed a
question

354
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,390
a.m. some banks to whitelisting which
means you have

355
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,860
you first transaction to account a and
the second time you you sent to account

356
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,540
you don't have to a transcendent sign
transactions anymore

357
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,080
am this is only because the

358
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,830
date don't want to to make its too
common for use it to

359
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,300
sign their transactions otherwise it's
it's too common

360
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,320
and they don't look at it any more but
them

361
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,380
yet again this isn't foolproof

362
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,660
so that there could be some them some

363
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,470
fraud cases as well

364
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,940
another another point is dis here

365
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,550
portability is for canales actually has
some guy at Microsoft at that

366
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,790
but that because of their development
thing but they're I found to

367
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,210
sentences saying nice what it's like

368
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,010
an on Monday summer financial Institute
will release a

369
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,600
complete mobile banking client so you
can a

370
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,940
to all your banking stuff if to mobile
phone

371
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,100
which means the you need some kind of

372
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,520
firm credential you can take review you
can take fifty

373
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,910
that solution you can use if that
solution

374
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,080
them now firm USB stick

375
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,970
definitely won't work the in

376
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,100
you could have some keyboard on

377
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm on a credit card that could work but
then you have to take the credit card if

378
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,610
you want

379
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,710
them this SEM this kind offer

380
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,270
move they don't like so if

381
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,660
if if ever you are at the conference
something's day show you

382
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,789
a credit card to be fair keyboard on it
just a to like this

383
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:35,890
a little bit and they will hate you
there

384
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:41,679
am you could have a efforts device

385
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,610
unlike term Tamagotchi like TM

386
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,940
calculator stuff something then you
always have to carry

387
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,760
a new device with you an an access card
like that the i-ten I shows before you

388
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,179
can have in your am

389
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:02,630
first that will probably work but then
again you're back

390
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,140
at that the i-ten which we actually want
to move away from

391
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,230
so talking about portability is really

392
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,990
problem what kind of credentials are
dear

393
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,669
you can take with you what kind of
credentials our date which still are you

394
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:20,130
support for the user

395
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,840
and still portable so

396
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,590
there are many credentials on the market
but

397
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,890
when talking about all of his points
many will fall out of your shortlist

398
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:38,340
or will not even trying there was
actually a talk before not sure how many

399
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,539
of you

400
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,720
were listening to it from Suisse com
twenty other am

401
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,530
just the room just before to stalk you
but it talked about

402
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,360
amo by Lady an again the you

403
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,520
you take it with you which is called but

404
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,039
them you have to same communication

405
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,510
channels like when in you do mobile
banking you have to same communication

406
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,130
channels for the banking

407
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,280
as you have for authentication assigning
which isn't ideal

408
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,919
it could work if everything works but
and it's not ideal so

409
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,580
really there is a is a problem what kind
of credential really works

410
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,350
and if you want to do a kickoff and you
have a good idea I guess this quite

411
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:28,680
much money to make do

412
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,820
them so

413
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,300
actually a.m. he could talk about
trusted devices

414
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,220
or we should talk about trusted devices
but then what is a trust

415
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,380
device am it should end

416
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,290
yes all session so it really is cleared
at everything you see

417
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,720
is a is legit make this is really art

418
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,720
I or itching from TD Bank and which
would be portable it should be a

419
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,470
user-friendly a.m. yet what is the
trusted device

420
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,700
probably you will will needs to update
that from

421
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,590
from afar as a you so you you need some
kind of firm

422
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,310
updating mechanism remote

423
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,570
access kind of thing which means there
is another attack surface

424
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,610
or at least a potential attack surface
if you don't make it updatable

425
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:27,240
a.m. probably will have to replace it
somewhere in its lifetime because he

426
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,020
found a buck

427
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,130
which you didn't find prior to the
rollout the

428
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,780
there were many ideas like a CD rom's

429
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,040
your you entered a CD-rom to your CD
Drive

430
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,080
and then you booted from that one the

431
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,180
at least you have to softer part assault

432
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,070
but term I'm not sure how many users
will use that you have to

433
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,140
shutdown your machine and two CD

434
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,610
booted again do your banking stuff shut
it down again

435
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,980
put it again if you owe us not very sure
if it's that usable

436
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,900
a.m. what they've seen is set this
that's twenty five dollar

437
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,060
or six British Pound now i guess its
dollar

438
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,440
a.m. computer a.m. could be a
possibility that

439
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,010
bank customers get the complete laptop
from their bank

440
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,830
just for doing am online banking

441
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,450
again you would have to to update that
one

442
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,640
so again another epic surface am

443
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:38,450
you see where this is heading to

444
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,640
so I am 2022 n that

445
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,340
a CNAME little bit or later now plant am

446
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,390
so you can have more questions than p.m.

447
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,000
this is really talking about credentials

448
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,800
is actually always because said it again
this morning

449
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,200
cat-and-mouse well there is rolled out
some when it's cracked

450
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,140
and cracking it isn't really wary much a
program

451
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,550
it's just a question of time and mostly
resources

452
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,950
and to probably knowing something about
it

453
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,830
so I'm at the end it's all this
calculating the risk

454
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,770
having a look at term at what this
possible

455
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,420
with what risks can you live what how
big will

456
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,940
the Los a speed and then the

457
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,800
you will decide which credentials the
rollout but every

458
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,710
credential I've seen so far is hackable
or the

459
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,200
at the end the user can be a can be
hacked

460
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,210
what social engineered into a submitting
to the TM

461
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,510
payment anyway so questions

462
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:51,510
this place

463
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:58,890
that the microphone

464
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,309
to post on the usability

465
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:05,510
and security office at bay City then
it's a business decision on how much

466
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,730
risk you want to take

467
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,539
as I want secure you tried to put into
the cost to an hour security due in the

468
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:12,480
back construction sucks monitoring

469
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,659
now if you look at the a lot of US
banking website still me ask for

470
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:19,919
username password don't have to stomach
which is top as you mentioned them

471
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,630
so Swiss banks most to make extremely
hard to login

472
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,590
for user he takes a lot of time but just
login because have all these additional

473
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,090
security settings need to wait for an
SMS into

474
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,030
you have ever types on challenge
response of which is extremely tedious

475
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,690
for users

476
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,280
so why is it that Swiss banks overalls
additional security

477
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,330
sings almost on that all sanitation side
if it in the end

478
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,470
so pretty I guess the same businesses
most US banks to

479
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,679
were apparently using password is good
enough for Citibank and

480
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,710
many others asked decision makes I

481
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,049
don't will you know I'm what I can say
is there was that term

482
00:31:55,049 --> 00:32:01,860
yep actually it was some kind of
research for a day I looked at them

483
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,159
at companies being attacked and

484
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,470
that usually you just want to be a
little bit better than the others

485
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,880
its its usually an arms race if you have
your house

486
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,750
you have or are a few houses in the
street a.m.

487
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,490
you have an alarm and some kind of all
our machinery

488
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,450
stuff and other stone you probably won't
get attacked but the others 1 Pittsburgh

489
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,090
licked

490
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,539
usually so at the end it's just an arms
race it's

491
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,049
I'm a little bit better than the other
so the others are getting attacked

492
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,220
and this is of course

493
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,320
a.m. one of the points as well to
consider

494
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,780
what have the others house TTT

495
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,950
the landscape of the attacks how many
attacks to be half

496
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,090
at at all and then it's just a calm you

497
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:55,360
to take that into consideration and this
user name password

498
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,360
suffers are too we have to have
something else thanks

499
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,610
so in the end it seems the good old
paper i-ten

500
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:14,260
isn't so bad after all are wyatt bank so
keen to get away from that

501
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,030
the of again my personal opinion

502
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,210
one is a.m. transaction signing

503
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,400
won't be possible if that one so

504
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,530
and the other one is them you don't
really know

505
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,179
who you state so you have to to them

506
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:41,880
paper copy something and you put
actually copy it

507
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,240
and your life but use it to Sun a.m.
wherever

508
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,260
and you don't really know who used it
sites that

509
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,230
attack to sell asked for all the numbers
anti-u_s_ has entered all of his number

510
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,830
still uses which status

511
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,880
and mmm yet if they have some kind of
time ago today

512
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,410
at least can only login once so I

513
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,919
it really isn't that foolproof I saw
their

514
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,369
credential types are how many attacks do
you see

515
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,130
the

516
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,000
asks which but on a comp sculptor

517
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,500
talk about numbers sort with yes some

518
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,659
comment for the first question in
america

519
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:33,179
as far as i know im kinda you only can
transfer money

520
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,540
money to the to account of the same bank
or two

521
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,840
bridges to it companies so you cannot

522
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,530
a transfer money to some bank account or
some other banks

523
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,550
its restricted as far as I know this is
actually a good point

524
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,179
the that's also a risk or some kind of
risk management

525
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,159
you say okay if you login with username
password you only have T's features

526
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,430
are you have that limit on money order
whatever

527
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,350
and if you look in with the with the

528
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,020
stronger authentication you have a
higher limit or you can

529
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:11,240
we have no limit at all but that surely
something which will I'm

530
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,450
income over here or or even more

531
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,020
that there are some some kind of a
mechanisms like post Finance has stepped

532
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,390
onto handy payment

533
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,160
only don't know a few hundred francs you
can submit

534
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,160
from two handy without any strong
authentication

535
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,380
am I guess this will calm with

536
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,600
that the online banking as well but
that's only a wild guess

537
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,140
to follow

538
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,289
on what you just said i've seen a Swiss
bank

539
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:48,509
have different type accounts there were
people

540
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:51,759
our account with read-only their
accounts with

541
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:56,529
limited at privilege to send money

542
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:01,220
endeavor accounts to to n3 transaction

543
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,619
but not able to actually executed and
endeavor accounts

544
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:10,950
buried you need it to loggins by two
different people into the same account

545
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,519
to execute transactions so if you think
a bit out of the box

546
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:20,099
there is a lot of more variance would
you can actually do

547
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:23,980
so you the problem is not solved so
maybe there

548
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:30,980
other solutions week which could help in
your situation

549
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,590
I'm are you allowed to wear comment on
the protection of your new model and

550
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,250
solution

551
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,550
sorry are you allowed to comment on the
protection of can you move on. solution

552
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:45,890
you're

553
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,920
rolling out you may also be in line

554
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,450
what are interesting in most how do you
protect it

555
00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:00,250
with these mechanisms we talk about this

556
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,880
later coffee or fear other accepted

557
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,180
but

558
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,920
place thank you the former

559
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,900
from a German bank account i've Eisinger
they have a very smart

560
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,799
a chance to sponsor meant to message
because

561
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:26,829
say that shares a in the input I have to

562
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,219
give to the external devices

563
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:34,809
a part of it is in receive your receive
a bank account number

564
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:38,960
and in -ism challenge and those bonds I
enter then

565
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,210
is based on that in Port so even if that
would be a man in the middle take

566
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,019
he could as it will not work because
people cause if you would in the

567
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,819
background change the recipient

568
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:52,739
bank account number the response I enter
would not to mention

569
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:55,940
but then it would fit right dusty using
know what he signs

570
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,950
yes it displays it it it to them

571
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,700
proms me to really check that what I am
entering is

572
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,539
his system what what system prompts you
it's the computer it's a computer I did

573
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,329
display I have to enter in the

574
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,170
external device a bank account number
sorus IP and a part of it

575
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,609
yeah but a.m. you know that does every
user of that bank no

576
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:21,950
that he enters the last few parts or
whatever of that

577
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,229
accounting number no as as example a.m.

578
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:28,420
you could have some kind of a screen
popping up after locking

579
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,200
which says a.m. this is some kind of
test police entities numbers

580
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,359
user angst is numbers makes

581
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,979
challenge response and your money is
away so I'll the problem again this

582
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:45,259
the user order/banker's no control over
to display of the usage so

583
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:50,569
anything could be written there and some
users

584
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:53,799
are believing it and RS sending their
money

585
00:38:53,799 --> 00:39:00,799
because of that and the don't even
recognize house would think okay I agree

586
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,600
you had a slight for you

587
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,460
announced hope the new talked about to
risk management

588
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:21,460
I could you explain please what they
wanted to say if that is actually

589
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,790
a.m. most of the discussions were only
about

590
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,369
credentials and only credentials and
their will to want

591
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,410
safe that this SEM the whole

592
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,160
store it's not only about credentials
credentials we can't really makes

593
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,590
secure or I haven't seen one credential
which Kant

594
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,770
be attacked in one or the other way so I
am

595
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,470
di hope must be coming from somewhere
else or to hope for is a solution

596
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,730
and the only a solution I currently see

597
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,610
is risk much so at the end it's just a

598
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:02,250
numbers against numbers just

599
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:09,150
just the second until to Mikes coming
but this is to a risk management this

600
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,130
sucks for me s

601
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,320
end-user because if my bank I Singh said

602
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,600
we take the risk but personally I get
the tech today

603
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,750
it sucks or my pay not not since a.m.

604
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,990
to do you know for offer customer

605
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,690
which has to pay because of the

606
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,740
offer for cup of the system or an attack
na and a successful

607
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,000
as she I know one person she had to

608
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,510
had to earn yeah mentions that she will
go to

609
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,180
cousins towards if if they don't pay it
back so only if gaza

610
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,460
when cousins towards came in C they pay
to take

611
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,510
but it was was a pin code on its a.m.
teller machines

612
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:54,510
okay hit you

613
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,280
I want to say a similar thing your
bottom line seems to be a

614
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,910
nothing really works because much are
two users are

615
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,310
early anyway just to interrupt you to T

616
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,670
did thing I want to say is it can't work
because there's always an attack

617
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:15,050
yep but a message from the other side
from

618
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,570
client-side so I think there are big
differences between

619
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,710
the system's because

620
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,930
love I'm not so much interested in what
the other customers to

621
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,260
I might be interested in securing my
transactions

622
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,720
because maybe I got the money back maybe
not

623
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,370
any case I'll have a lot of trouble to
get it back so I want to avoid this

624
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:40,530
so I have a system but get me some
information on

625
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,770
on a display I can say okay I want those

626
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,730
key and some sumpin not into the
computer but I'm too

627
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,840
class 3 card reader or whatever device

628
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,020
so I gets something out of that system

629
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,090
even if u from Mar risk

630
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:02,120
find a few may say okay this works for
ten percent of the user's

631
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,120
and ninety percent on other so i i think
there are a lot of differences

632
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,290
I'll which are kind of your

633
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:13,470
if you've just say at the end the usable
always

634
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,050
are break it up because he doesn't pay
attention

635
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,050
but let's talk about alternatives that
there aren't really

636
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,510
at least for me a.m. the owner told

637
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,790
alternative I know it's you take your
money if you you go to the next

638
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,250
bank or post the bureau and to half your
am

639
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,720
suitcase with for your thousands of
francs and to pay it like that

640
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,490
for me it this isn't really alternative
to electronic payment

641
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:44,710
if I have a system but dismay

642
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,420
good security as long as I pay attention
to what I do

643
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,420
that's a good alternative for me and
it's much better than a system

644
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,760
I say okay of like like though

645
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,990
credit card system so they say well we
don't put in any security or they used

646
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,710
to say that

647
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,960
I'm be just reimburse you if something
happens so I don't like that

648
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,960
so much as a system I say if

649
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,750
II pay attention look after my money

650
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,080
I won't lose the money souls I think
that makes a difference

651
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,350
and also the the other thing with the
there

652
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,850
of course after update any divisive

653
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,420
we have to be able to update it so don't
think that's

654
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,160
kinda for on arguments to

655
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,390
to roll out security out everything
because I think the big difference was

656
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,060
after update a PC

657
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,080
every day in all the applications and
stuff or other half

658
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,290
kind of card reader which might have to
update

659
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,610
once in a while and I think there should
be a pretty good solutions to

660
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,520
to handle us I'll that's it's much
easier to

661
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,280
to keep your or your card reader clean
trying to keep a

662
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,540
PC clean but then your card region needs
to be the end point of two that

663
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:07,430
to secure channel of course of us can be
done yeah I guess there was some

664
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,790
question too packed somewhere

665
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,800
or not anymore

666
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,050
no more questions then a

667
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,430
thank you thank you Adrian
