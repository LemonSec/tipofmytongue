29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,159
later kilograms per paper print it

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,530
the strong we had 200 last year

31

this year was one hundred we going green
sort of

32
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,760
but we're reading more emails companies
ask for sponsoring

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,680
from 150 we increase our 207 might also

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,750
your reason for the milf

35

37
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,130
I won't say which one but you'll find
out we have

38
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,000
a fun fact all love you registered found
out that we registered to take its

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,950
over Eventbrite but with didn't just
jews

40
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,510
Eventbrite because we thought it's the
coolest um

41
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,750
we tried other to getting come

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,959
applications ants in

43
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,040
March I registered for ticketing
application in draft mode

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,139
I'm so I made some are

45
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:04,049
ticket buying for 1300 Swiss francs
Worcester

46
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,699
Dhami credit cards to check out how the
invoice look for the ticket looks

47
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,030
if everything is done as week needed

48
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,359
finally we thought

49
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,160
well let's go with the been pried it had
more arm

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,760
options that we needed but the fun fact:
is

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,540
coupla months later they sent

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,780
as money

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,459
on a draft mode conference don't to
dislike

54
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,379
we thought we could raise money very
easily make make a short conference two

55
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,730
days 10002

56
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,959
was trying to take a chance just don't
get out of the draft mode

57
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,629
but this is don't don't do it but we
don't know who exactly it was

58
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,500
of course we race to this issue

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,400
at the company but of course but over to
support because support which they are

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,450
okay I will

61
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,549
just give us back the money we wanted to
have some sort of attention

62
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,519
and state Rep explained us that the air
processes and things in here and and

63
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
but finally we're on the way sending the
money back

64
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,620
they failed to give us the correct
banking income

65
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,799
yet I but we'll we'll get it done

66
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,359

just next to the door

141
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,370
assume also at the bar you have two
possible to smoke

142
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,589
outside important fact in Switzerland
were changing time

145
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,959
don't forget it I said it now

146
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,430

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,920
whatever you want or the flight leaves
an hour later

149
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,320
it arm we have our own GSM network

150
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,560
I last year the network operator name is
hades days

151
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,740

tryst

153
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,839
connect your mobile phone I'm let its
search for operators and then you see a

154
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:47,920
