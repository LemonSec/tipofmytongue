1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,820
good morning everybody for

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,310
for my part as well

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,600
it's good to be here saw been an
interesting trip for me but I'll wanna

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,279
I'll just skip all the details let's get
in today real meat of the matter

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:29,349
I think I finally made it

6
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:32,590
professionally after working twenty
years

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,440
in this business yesterday we were
looking at

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,780
some botnet command-and-control servers
and

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,200
I was not depart fire fellow researcher
to one of the

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,360
hostname study but that was connecting
to us

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,070
in kazakhstan sold top-level domain case
said

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,110
make got it but it sucks operational
right not to

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,770
at the IP address right right there so
good we haven't taken it down it's

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,630
idea how could I be angry about that
right to know

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,900
its most likely will a date raised the
same gang was operating Prado lap

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,689
earlier but and of course if you're
interested on who registered the domain

17
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:15,689
you can go and I'm check it out from the
Hui sits by Don Kodansha

18
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,720
from games will I didn't know

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,430
dung co lives in games will but so I
must have been doing something right I

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:24,920
guess

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,290
after working 10 years at f-secure I
gotta watch

22
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,870
Swiss watch Amiga nice after wrecking
twenty years at f-secure I get an extra

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,920
week of summer holiday my summer holiday
stuff I weeks which is nice

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,060
and of course the the logic for why I
gotta Amiga

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,360
is that the very first virus we ever
analyzed at f-secure

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,299
was called Amiga I know because I named
it

27
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,479
I analyzed it in 1991 and I've named it

28
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,869
amigo because it displayed to the Amiga
sign on-screen

29
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,689
and then we started a tradition that
when you've been 10 years with the

30
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,450
company you get an Amiga watch

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,510
so I know your thinking what I'm
thinking I

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,450
should up name the virus fair re: right
next time

33
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:13,860
but we all work

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,480
in one way or another with security

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,879
or computer security when we work

36
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,379
in security what we are ultimately doing

37
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,709
is that we are helping people people

38
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,829
obviously cannot hope to cope

39
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:35,019
with today's computer security problems
by themselves

40
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,799
I mean normal human beings can't do it
anymore it's way beyond that

41
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,319
if you look at just just viruses I made
up something that people used to know

42
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,109
that they were infected with viruses
would do something

43
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:50,590
no at the very least they would be
destructive people know that there's

44
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,529
something going on

45
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:54,739
because they are going to lose all the
files on their computers or the computer

46
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,419
keeps crashing or rebooting

47
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:01,439
or a virus plays music or shows funny
animations something like that well

48
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:01,999
today

49
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:06,950
nothing like that happens today smile
where world slow down your PC

50
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,840
won't crash your PC won't delete
anything will play music won't do

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,969
anything that you would actually

52
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:16,819
know it's happening you get infected by
something like the deal for

53
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:20,889
you won't be able to tell and even if
you somehow

54
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,659
learned during affected you will not be
able to get rid of it by yourself

55
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,999
so the end users need us that's
basically our job to help

56
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:36,999
the ones who called help themselves and
the best way for us to help the ones who

57
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,639
can't help themselves is to understand
who we are fighting

58
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,749
if we want to stick your computer's

59
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:49,719
sure we can run all the firewalls and do
all the backups and and do the patching

60
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,199
and

61
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,749
minnow whatever you you can think of but
thats actually

62
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:57,379
not going to make the problem smaller
that's like a band-aid

63
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,669
Mike it helps with the immediate pain

64
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,870
but dust nothing to read used

65
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,189
future attacks the only way to read use

66
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:12,359
future attacks is to understand where
the attacks are coming from

67
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:18,060
and try to do something to minimize to
the attackers

68
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,810
keep changing during the twenty years I
worked in this business they've changed

69
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,720
several times when I started

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,630
almost all the attackers were doing the
attacks for fun

71
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,790
for for fun for challenge for fame maybe

72
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,040
that's what they were teenagers hacking
servers for excitement

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,530
of course they are still at attackers
like that as well

74
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,900
but overall today I would group

75
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,200
all the attacks in 23 main group

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,490
we have first the wall the organized
criminal gangs who do the attacks to

77
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,100
make money

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,840
second a ball the hacktivists

79
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,480
and third attacks launched by countries

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,830
and nation-states that's where the main

81
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,060
attacks are coming from and I decided to
give you examples

82
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,090
of of each of these so

83
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,110
organized criminal gangs hootie

84
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,860
scarface right I do is cough is

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,130
are you are you there

86
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,880
good

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,389
this is not the kind of criminal were
fighting when we're fighting organized

88
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:32,979
crime

89
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,169
on the net we're not talking about
real-world of it we're talking about

90
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,680
completely new kind

91
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,210
organized crime in fact let's think
about organized crime

92
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,380
what is organized crime was organized
crime ten years ago

93
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,720
ten years ago organized crime loss drug
trafficking

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,180
money laundering smuggling stuff like
that

95
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,040
since that

96
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,070
over the last 10 years in addition of
that type of

97
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,580
international organized crime we have
suddenly

98
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,490
we're not only facing all this internet
organized crime which didn't really

99
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,169
exist in the sense ten years ago I mean
nobody was writing by rosies to make

100
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:11,600
money

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,650
ten years ago it started pretty much
around 2002 2003

102
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,850
and that means that the

103
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,090
overall a mild of international crime
house

104
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,100
just exploded over the last 10 years but
of the resources to fight

105
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,700
international crime have those resources
also exploded

106
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,120
not have in fact that pretty much
exactly the same resources we have ten

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,680
years ago

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,870
things like Europol and Interpol and so
we're actually doing a lousy job

109
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,880
infighting international crime when it
comes to online crime that's one of the

110
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,280
main

111
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,330
main challenges we have we pretty well
know what we're supposed to do was

112
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,570
supposed to use international law
enforcement to catch International

113
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,320
Criminal to put them behind bars

114
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,320
but we're doing a lousy job in actually
doing that although these guys aren't

115
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,210
real gangsters be like to look like
gangsters for tell these guys the box

116
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,599
website operating in some Petersburg run
by russians

117
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,389
specializing in buying infected
computers or buying access to infected

118
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,970
computers if you are a virus writer but
you don't know how

119
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,560
don't know how to monetize the computers
were infected can simply sell

120
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,840
the computers are infected to these guys
they'll pay you money

121
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,180
the money depends on which country the
infected computer is in

122
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,860
yet another one this is sad iframe based
called used to run in saint petersburg

123
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,640
its

124
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,510
it's been down now for a year or so but
it sort of gives you a good impression

125
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,580
of the kinda file

126
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,760
lifestyle these guys would like to try
to impose

127
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,419
virus writers you know right by receipts

128
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,570
make money buy a BMW

129
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,180
impress girls in of that kinda flushed
but is it really

130
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,250
like that is that really how virus
writers live

131
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,360
do they really make money with viruses
well here's a photo

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,340
which was found during for into
extermination of a drop site

133
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,969
a server which was used in operation
related to banking Trojans

134
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:17,460
while doing forensic examination that
this deleted folder just found

135
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,610
and that folder hat budget images taken
with a digital camera

136
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,900
one of the images this we try to
estimate how much money there isn't a

137
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,880
photo it around

138
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,010
one and a half million dollars yes that
looks like a lot of money but we have to

139
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,659
remember

140
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:39,659
but the value of dollar has been going
down so if the lifestyle of

141
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,800
online criminal tomorrow's writers
really like this well actually yes

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,510
it pretty much piece/pieces Albert
Gonzalez photographed

143
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,800
at the penthouse suites

144
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,900
of I believe the W Hotel

145
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,589
which is one of the most expensive
hotels in New York arm

146
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,839
this is his partner in crime mister
Stephen what

147
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,430
known online us a UNIX terrorist if you
actually go online you'll find

148
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,760
video of his Def Con talk from def good
Las Vegas from nineteen

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,329
I don't know 2.2 maybe something like
that he was the Aries photographed

150
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:18,160
partying

151
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,709
at the private pool of our

152
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,100
another expensive New York Hotel

153
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,089
of these guys of Fort a lifestyle like
this

154
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,450
of course they're not paying these bills
with their credit cards they're babying

155
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:33,910
them

156
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,940
with our credit cards to these guys are
america's

157
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,600
but majority of the attackers actually
are not in fact if you look at the

158
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,750
hotspots globally

159
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,920
of course russians all Russia Ukraine
Kazakhstan

160

bill Irish here in Europe maybe Romania

161
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,740
are moldova produces much more moderate
and that they should for country of that

162
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,970
size

163
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,709
arm China Brazil so on

164
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,230
curious to meet a callable from Ukraine
Rex next to being

165
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,480
Ludhiana chechen from the city of Botox
in Estonia

166
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,540
examples of the kind of guys who are

167
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,970
behind the attacks and of course the
mechanisms vary

168
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,630
but they are basically typically in the
range of

169
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,250
Roque under fire is ease rogue registry
cleaners which are

170
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,220
push to end users keyloggers to steal
credit card numbers

171
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,940
banking Trojans to move money around
from online backs

172
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,060
here sa the Swedish yards and Dean
together with his partner in crime

173
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,280
much article by jane from United States
these guys were behind

174
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,120
the IM you operation so the actual

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,860
coder school were writing the model
where these guys were using to become

176
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,589
rich we're all ukrainians

177
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,449
but these guys were not great news they
were running an international crime gang

178
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,810
where the actual code River ukraine by
themselves were

179
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,680
mostly in USA these guys are still on
the run

180
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,490
this picture is from Interpol pages from
the 13 pages

181
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,930
nobody knows where they are but the
secret service from United States froze

182
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,020
a Swiss bank accounts belonging to
Charlotte by Jane

183
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,980
around two months ago that bank account
had 14 docked nine million US dollars on

184
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,040
it

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,890
so the amount of money these guys are
making is significant

186
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,470
last statistics from Brazil

187
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,560
say that the Brazilian banks

188
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,449
lost 480 million US dollars

189
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:38,829
to banking Trojan attacks during the
first half of this year

190
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:42,939
for the somebody walking around on the
streets of Sao Paulo

191
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:45,949
width 480 million US dollars in their
pockets

192
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:49,620
think about that that's a lot of money
especially in Brazil that is a lot of

193
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,600
money

194
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,100
in fact quite surprisingly brazil is the
number one country in the world in

195
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,650
producing banking Trojans

196
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,829
Brazilian banks have pro the best
security mechanisms i've seen anywhere

197
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,270
else because the attacks are so bad
uneven

198
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,319
those mechanisms are great they are
still broken all the time

199
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,949
regardless of what kind of mechanisms
they've tried and they've tried pretty

200
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:12,650
much everything including

201
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,949
of course want i poss birch challenge
response bearish

202
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:20,390
arm up custom-made

203
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,189
job I interfaces for the online bank Jul

204
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:29,620
they've also tried secure ID chips
they've tried SMS old authorization

205
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,620
older and everything has been broke in
fact we saw last

206
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,439
spring one really really clever attack
against that Brazilian band called quake

207
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,000
struck

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,060
and that attack is so clever that

209
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,430
I actually cannot figure out a way on
how to stop

210
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,400
I can't imagine any authorization
mechanism

211
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,510
which would fix the problem and the way
that particle or

212
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,240
banking Trojan worked is dat first to
get infected

213
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,560
as usual you get infected by surfing the
web with your Windows computer you get

214
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,819
hit by a drive-by download because you
have

215
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,949
but on Patch I do get PDF Reader plugin
inside your browser or you haven't

216
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:14,640
touched Java or on patch to QuickTime or
something like that

217
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,170
but Munster infected the only thing that
the Trojan das

218
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,850
is that it waits for you to look into
this bank's website

219
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,459
once you login the bank's website it
doesn't modify your payments

220
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:31,240
it doesn't change anything it just
displays extra one extra page

221
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,430
between the login before you actually
enter

222
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,110
the back and that page what advertisment

223
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,270
advertisment which look like internet
British but from the back

224
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,230
it had the bank logos different
animations very well done was likely

225
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,850
done with

226
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,949
some at ages at the add

227
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,030
told the user that we have now launched

228
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,850

229
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,560

230
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,800

this week

231
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,690

232
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,980
investment account you get a free
Nintendo Wii

233
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,220
now there's an image of intend oh and
Mario animations

234
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,579
and that it continues to start investing
into your investment account please move

235
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:21,899
at least 2,000 Riaz

236
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,389
to your investment account number keys
and this

237
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,149
to people rate this and they see that a
great deal

238
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,420
as a good return that's not too much
money absolutely I want a Nintendo Wii

239
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,070
so now the user himself really watched a
movie

240
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,690
his money that is a cup

241
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,329
for the new owners click OK to continue
now they are in the real bank and they

242
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,190
really believe

243
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,430
it's a real thing and now day will be
themselves

244
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,670
going through all the hoops table be
using their secure ID chips are

245
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,370
answering text messages whatever to bank
is trying to do

246
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,690
to prevent back intro to need all goes
through

247
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,500
how do you fix that I don't know I don't
know

248
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,519
how do you fix credit card theft

249
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,980
I'll first we have to look who's
actually paying

250
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,370
for the credit card fraud in most cases
it's not

251
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,100
the credit card companies in most cases
it's the online Americans

252
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,370
who get get food with the bill once

253
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,209
keylogger steal people's credit card
numbers and a card numbers are used by

254
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,750
stolen car but buy goods like iPhone to
sell them further or used as credit card

255
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,370
numbers in online games like poker games
to move money away from the

256
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:43,779
accounts

257
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,970
one more example of banking Trojans post
bank in germany

258
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,570
introduced text message a all the

259
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,940
of the cation around a year ago and the
reason why danger dues dist

260
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,449
SMS text message on occasion is very
clear banking Trojans

261
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:04,079
seeing on the computer can change the a
college you think you are sending money

262
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,510
to

263
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,779
so you go to an online banking you think
you are sending 100 euros to your

264
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,029
electricity company to

265
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,420
debate your electricity bill at the
Trojan on your computer changes the

266
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,720
account the different number and

267
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,949
of of your goes of the money goes the
way they

268
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:21,670
decided to fix that is that every time
you send money it sent you a text

269
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,779
message to your phone

270
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,959
and that of course on your text message
you will see the real account number and

271
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,160
you'll figure out that you know

272
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,130
there's something wrong because the
account numbers don't match that's a

273
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:30,920
great idea

274
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,660
exxon foolproof can't be hacked right

275
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,130
wrong this is what the real page looks
like when you go there from a

276
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,180
claim computer when you go there from an
infected computer to page

277
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,459
Changi turnout explains the you that the
bank has introduced

278
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,959
another new security feature which is a
mobile security app

279
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,560
please give your mobile phone number
here so we can send you say hi to

280
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,199
control a

281
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,519
a security control program running on
your phone and they have a version for

282
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,880
Android for Symbian and BlackBerry

283
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,420
and then when you install this on your
phone and continue

284
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,560
doing banking from the infected Windows
computer when it triggers

285
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,990
a text message to your phone this to hit
Heights controller will intercept a text

286
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,639
message and reply back at yes

287
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:17,189
please move the money and the user never
even sees the message

288
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,300
so the game of cat and mouse whatever
obstacles we can throw in the way of

289
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,379
these guys take a bigger a way around it

290
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,780
just like I mean lockpicking exactly the
same problem even the best

291
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,060
mines in the world whatever locked they
can imagine

292
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,070
of course it can be picked everything

293
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,889
can be broken if it it can be hard but
it can be done

294
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:44,600
right

295
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,890
so what about

296
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,310
group number two online

297
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,890
social activists groups like an animal
scripts like LulzSec

298
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,130
I'm in charge at

299
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,140
f-secure for what we call trap a threat
assessment

300
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,030
program which is where we tried for a
custom future try to try to see where

301
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,390
we're going to come up with

302
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,660
to plans on how to how do how do be
ready for future changes

303
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,870
and this was one thing that I missed
overall

304
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,760
we were trying to think what could
happen in the future we didn't really

305
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,150
see this happening this has been a
fairly rapid change

306
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,150
a year ago of course anonymous existed
but they were not know where nearly as

307
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,760
active

308
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,370
and visible as they are today a big part
of this of course is related to

309
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,190
WikiLeaks and just like other than us
Weekly has been around for years and

310
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,470
years five years or so

311
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,030
but they'd word really very visible
under un until they started leaking

312
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,350
information related to US government
including the Iraq war files and the

313
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,450
embassy cables which we made them a
high-profile

314
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,100
operation which of course cost: into
problems after Visa and MasterCard stop

315
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,990
money traffic

316
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,330
in donations to WikiLeaks as we know

317
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,490
very quickly and in a must took offense
in that and started to large-scale

318
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,350
denial of service attacks against

319
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,290
Visa and MasterCard and quite
surprisingly shutting down

320
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,610
at least briefly but really dumb anyway
both with a dot com

321
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,110
a Moscato by the way was I dot com runs
and above aka by

322
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,590
so it's it's actually pretty interesting
that these guys were able to china doll

323
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,100
with fairly simple attacks

324
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,280
there's also one lesson to be learnt
their

325
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,690
at the same time when the develop
service attacks were

326
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,750
targeting is a common MasterCard com arm

327
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,680
the same attackers also try china doll
papal papal dot com

328
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,260
this paper had also shut down donations
to WikiLeaks

329
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,000
a papal the comp didn't go to their
system for good enough

330
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,360
no problem so what did the beat the
attackers to

331
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,100
well they look for alternative targets
and they found papeles

332
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,410
block which is running at Pay Pal block
dot com when Pay Pal

333
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,890
had been securing their systems they had
made

334
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,630
the conscious decision that the crucial
resources Pay Pal to pub

335
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,910
that's what we have to protect our block
is not crucial

336
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,600
and of course it went to and of course

337
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,020
that's not too bad but that's not the
way

338
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,130
the media sort if you go back

339
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,910
and repaired lines for February what the
media was writing that

340
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,550
be sup boss to cart and Pay Pal were all
down

341
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,660
because papal block was to and there's a
lesson to be learned here like when you

342
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,210
are securing your systems

343
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,740
you have to secure even the even the
business which

344
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,180
art actually important or otherwise

345
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,560
the public and the media will assume but
you were taken down even though you

346
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,150
weren't really taken down but was taken
down in this case

347
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:46,040
wasn't crucial in any way so this is
arab are

348
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,050
who used to be the CEO of HB Gary
federal

349
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,740
security company which was specializing
in producing consulting and

350
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,290
products for US government and

351
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,700
one thing they were specializing in Los
intelligence-gathering

352
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,870
from social networks soul

353
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,950
me to bar got interested

354
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,010
animals and infiltrated Adam Walsh

355
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,110
which wasn't really that hard when you
just find the discussion boards and the

356
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,700
IRC's a new goal there is one of them he
had multiple different personas and he

357
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,280
was there for several weeks collecting
information and

358
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,520
intelligence nicknames IP address the
stuff like that that he goes

359
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,710
a given interview about the topic to

360
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,170
forbes where he explained that he's done
all the senate gonna

361
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,540
give a talk about this at the b-side San
Francisco

362
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,140
in at the same time with the RS a
conference in March bad idea

363
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,750
he gave the interview Friday he was
supposed to give a talk on Tuesday

364
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,040
he never gave the talk because during
the weekend between these two events

365
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,530
his Home Server was hacked

366
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,690
his Facebook but act his Twitter was
hacked

367
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,860
is gmail was hacked HB Gary Federals
website

368
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,960
was defaced HB carry Federals I

369
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,990
file server was hacked and their email

370
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,870
server was hacked and the attackers

371
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,370
published the whole five-year history of
the email

372
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,360
server in fact they published on a
server here in Switzerland on I don't

373
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,080
leak stop ch

374
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,890
it still online today right now anybody
can go and search

375
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,230
the whole five-year history of this
company for anything to interested in

376
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,080
including

377
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,640
all the private emails all the
confidential emails

378
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,560
all declassified emails all the email
exchange between the US government

379
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,530
and HB Gary Farrell is right there and
that's a pretty devastating attack

380
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,000
that's good example how ruthless

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,370
a group like this can be when they feel
threatened when the attack against

382
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,630
somebody day perceive on

383
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,190
as a threat

384
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,230
his photo I took at the RC conference
for HB Gary were supposed to have a both

385
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,280
they didn't they canceled their both and
he do in fact here it says that to

386
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,460
they are gonna have both because in
addition to the day the theft aid

387
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,760
its bigger individuals have received
numerous threats of while its

388
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,600
so they had to cancel double

389
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,179
so who r these people

390
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,960
well there's been quite a few arrests in

391
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,880
I think six or seven countries I think
the total count is low 160

392
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,970
people arrested arm this is from Spain
was spanish police arrest date:

393
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,810
like 16 Adams activists and they
basically get a press conference that

394
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,730
you know

395
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,800
an animal has been arrested no problem
is now over

396
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,380
and the next day for some mysterious
reason police ya

397
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,040
dot ES was crashed with denial of
service attack so

398
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,960
wasn't that simple

399
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,800
but if you look beyond just the fact
that there's been a rest and have a look

400
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,910
at the okay what do these guys look like

401
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,740
so here's some of the people have been
arrested in United States and it sort of

402
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,240
the kind of guys

403
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,350
arm or USA and UK and it sort of the
guys you

404
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,370
you're expecting like you know angry
young men right

405
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,860
but that's not the whole story here's to
more much upstate is such a crazy and

406
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,290
Valenzuela and its Mercedes rene hofer

407
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,250
she's 42 she's 20 not the traditional

408
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,080
angry and Matt at all

409
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,460
select a seven day is like this they
themselves sa we are all

410
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,590
and so we roll members about animals
anonymous

411
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,340
are members of an animal and this is

412
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,169
it is the next generation that's growing
up and it is D

413
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:50,070
this is the way it is protest thing has
changed

414
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,679
and it's not going to go away

415
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:57,690
for the last group we are criminals

416
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,269
we have hacktivists been we have
countries launching these attacks

417
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:05,669
when will

418
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,970
talk about attacks launched by countries
a nation states there's

419
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,519
a range of things like espionage spying
spying has completely

420
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,580
almost completely moved but the online
world because but what is buying

421
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,539
spying is collecting information what
information information is data

422
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:25,779
of course it is data now spying used to
be

423
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,250
something where you had to physically
enter a building to poppy papers because

424
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,460
information what on paper

425
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,899
now it is not on paper now it stayed at
which means you can reach it

426
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,720
at least in theory from anywhere in the
world so espionage

427
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,129
is one thing then we have a tax like a
government attacking their own citizens

428
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:48,000
examples from Iran examples from Germany
buddhist trojan or starch trojan or

429
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,179
whatever you call it r2 d2 and then we
have

430
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,789
for the lack of better word things like

431
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,870
cyberwar or or lime warfare

432
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,789
of which we haven't really had the ring
very good examples yet but we will

433
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:08,350
military has changed

434
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,809
at a great weapon

435
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,049
like troll tanks at your enemy that's
gonna do

436
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:18,250
I can't explain day which I just found
it online but I your

437
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:25,210
I'm fascinated by the mechanisms of this
so

438
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,929
espionage is both a dumb but targeted
attacks and targeted tax means that you

439
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:31,120
receive an e-mail

440
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,740
which is commencing you receive an
e-mail from your friend from your

441
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,889
colleague from your customer and it
contains

442
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:41,909
attachment which is relevant like this
example that a PDF file which were sent

443
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:42,529
to a

444
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,919
a technical engineer at a defense
contractor

445
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,190
and the PDF contents are about
high-efficiency dc-dc converters

446
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,450
which is what the guy was working with
but its Trojan eyes by the time you have

447
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,960
it on your screen you've already

448
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
been infected by a back door which
connects from your computer to an

449
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,909
outside address

450
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:04,169
whose whoever is at that address has
full access to a PC

451
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:07,509
a full access to everything you can
access in your local area network

452
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:12,289
and we've seen a lot of these have
another PDF Converter Pro John

453
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,730
in another PDF contains a Trojan yet
another PDF

454
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,850
called it a Trojan yet another PDF
contains a Trojan

455
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,860
another one well he's actually a word
for us not all of them are PDF

456
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,919
believes are the most common one still
this talked about some units have

457
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,789
meetings

458
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:29,830
contains a Trojan here's an excel file
contains

459
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,539
fairly realistic looking content but it
contains a Trojan

460
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,009
another one here's another PDF file

461
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:40,220
is another one sent to an Air Force I'll

462
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,179
general this is a Word file we found
this

463
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:47,250
like five days ago that we have these as
well like this

464
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,029
this cont was not all of them are like
business content

465
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,389
I don't know who she is but it was one
of the files we found but two weeks ago

466
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,730
contains a Trojan and so on and so on
and so on

467
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:05,470
to PowerPoint for and we do see the
whole different languages

468
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,960
fears Russian this is German spike in a
system

469
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,220
lies to smack Mar toward a star of

470
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,159
my German is rusty but look fairly
convincing to me

471
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,450
I don't speak Arabic but I'm convinced
that's

472
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:29,450
fairly convincing as well so who's hit
for this is Alfred noble

473
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,759
of a noble d-nev the guy we have a date

474
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:37,940
dynamite and

475
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,690
because dynamite ended up being used in
wars he

476
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,759
got a bad conscience out a bit when you
get older so we created this Noble Peace

477
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,240
Prize

478
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,360
so who won Noble Peace price

479
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,960
a year ago last year must

480
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,070
a guy called lucia both this guy right
here

481
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,960
a Chinese dissident who were not able to
pick up the best price

482
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,919
in person because he is under house
arrest in China this here

483
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,169
is Noble Peace Prize to orc which is a
website running or slow

484
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,519
at pretty much exactly a week after

485
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,019
is peace prize was announced this
website was hacked

486
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,269
was hacked as somebody inserted a
drive-by downloads

487
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:27,190
with one lot of JavaScript to every
single page Noble Peace Prize dork and

488
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,919
that

489
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,179
one might have JavaScript launched a
attack with a zero-day against Firefox

490
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,389
so if you with the Noble Peace Prize
with Firefox

491
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:40,919
you get hit by a back door which get
access to a computer

492
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,750
one of the administrators of this
website

493
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,000
investigated the case found out about
what happened

494
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,269
cleaned the site did for a sec
examination analyzed how they were

495
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:52,600
breached

496
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,590
fixed everything unless the exploit he
did a great job overall

497
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,889
in fixing in fact he did such a great
job

498
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:04,609
on fixing the problem that he got
invited the Noble Peace Prize ceremony

499
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:10,220
he received an email

500
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,480
an email sent by Alex Gladstein from
Oslo Freedom Forum in New York which is

501
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
a real organization and Alex Gladstein
really

502
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,100
exists in fact my I called up mister
black but I spoke

503
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,030
about this with him and he confirmed
that yes that is his email address

504
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,170
yes that is signature nope he did not
sent his email

505
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,930
and the attachment an invitation and
Noble Peace Prize ceremony

506
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,430
doc pdf if you open up the attachment it
is a real

507
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,610
invitation to the real Noble Peace Prize
ceremony

508
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,730
and mister class then confronted yes
that's a real invitation and

509
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:49,190
yes it has an exploit and it has a
Trojan so weird that the attackers get

510
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,880
this file

511
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,420
great question I mean these files don't
exactly flowed around you get that

512
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,910
Google for an invitation to the Noble
Peace Prize ceremony

513
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:01,250
we don't know where they got it from and
even better question who's behind this

514
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,170
attack who launched his attack which
country

515
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:07,150
launched his attack I dunno

516
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:13,650
Denmark maybe because China has

517
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,160
always denied any involvement in any
ESPN Arsch

518
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,910
or in are online attacks on my wall for
any of that

519
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,570
but they did run into a slight problem
earlier this year

520
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,330
this AM TV channel called CCT 7

521
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,850
in China which is TV channel run by the
government

522
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:38,350
for topics related to agriculture and
military they published

523
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,400
a documentary about online warfare

524
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,380
earlier this year and it's like a 20
minute propaganda documentary where

525
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,210
too general to explain the concepts of
cyber warfare and and how to defend and

526
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,630
how to attack and all that

527
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,870
fairly normal document but there's one

528
00:31:54,870 --> 00:32:00,290
interesting part of the documentary most
likely by accident

529
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,750
they ended up leaving this one snippet
like a bee roast me but in there

530
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,930
which very briefly show someone opening
up

531
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,160
a Chinese application choosing some
settings and clicking a button

532
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,440
is lasts like five seconds but we have

533
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,570
that translated what does the
application actually say the

534
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,070
applications says at the top

535
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,580
it says Papa right people Liberation
Army choose a target

536
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,929
here start at least he too was one which
has an IP address and click the button

537
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:29,510
which is

538
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:36,160
attack and the IP address is in United
States of America and that this is

539
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,330
my friends what I call the smoking gun a

540
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,240
know better what they say the fact is
they have written a program like this

541
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,610
and it is copyright pela and a show

542
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,220
is themselves on and propaganda
documentary they make themselves which

543
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,970
was paired on a government channel

544
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,000
when we found out about this

545
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,020
be we put it put it in our block we've
be

546
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,820
guess that it's gonna disappear if the
document is gonna go away from the

547
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,410
website

548
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,510
I did disappeared from the Chinese
website two days later

549
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,000
hasn't returned so most likely these was
some sort of a goof they weren't really

550
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,440
supposed to make this public

551
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:19,440
but they did so what's happening right
now

552
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,700
well last year was the year of Stuxnet

553
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,270
which is the most complicated milder be
ever seen and as you've read from the

554
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,580
news two weeks ago

555
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,970
and you Trojan called ducal must follow

556
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,590
a ducal shares a lot woodstock

557
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,590
chairs code but even more importantly I
think it shares

558
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,250
techniques including the fact that it
has

559
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,820
speed uses signed kernel drivers which
have been signed

560
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,020
with real certificates which have been
stolen

561
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,170
from companies in Taiwan Stuxnet

562
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,190
it this do go dust is in fact one of the
drivers used by Dougal

563
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,330
arm is

564
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,810
to has been published by company called
Jamie crown which is a real

565
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,100
company in Taiwan and Jamie Kerr was one
of the drivers

566
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,250
signatures Houston started as well I
believe

567
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,840
80s connected if not done by the same

568
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,540
party well one theory we

569
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,970
we do have is that if stocks it was done
by US government

570
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,870
it's like that they didn't write
themselves the out started to a defense

571
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,450
contractor of some sort

572
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,350
maybe it is that company or maybe these
individuals from the company who

573
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,030
participated in stocks the devil open
doing something on their own

574
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,889
maybe its debt we don't really know but
it

575
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:42,050
isn't shredding duco is not a word
stocks it was

576
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,169
were made for spreading around the world
to go isn't spreading

577
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,800
be found only a handful of infections

578
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,940
one of them in Hungary arm one of them

579
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,470
are in a country icon name 67 of them in
Iran

580
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,480
which is interesting one of them in

581
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,870
this country that Iran this is

582
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,870
shugart in Africa

583
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:14,680
so we have and you Trojan with links to
stocks met which has infected

584
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,450
servers or computers in Iran and should
I

585
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,600
what is the connection between Iran as
to dock

586
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,290
well if you go to the US Department of
State of list of countries that support

587
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,300
terrorism

588
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,080
this four countries on this list cuba

589
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,900
Suria Iran answered on

590
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,220
now this is probably a coincidence right

591
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,980
so that's the enemy we're fighting

592
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,590
we have big organized crime

593
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,840
we have activists then we have
nation-states

594
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,690
and while it's fairly clear that you
know to fight crime you use police

595
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,630
it also has clear that to fight attacks
launched by other countries you don't

596
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,080
used to police that's not the task of
police if you look at the real world and

597
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,040
one country goes into a war against
another country it's not the police

598
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,130
but handle step right it's not a crime

599
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,520
its war so we probably shouldn't be
expecting these nation-state attacks to

600
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,900
be handled by traditional law
enforcement either

601
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,930
that's not their job

602
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,590
but one thing is clear: we've probably
seen

603
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,750
only the very beginning all of these
problems

604
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,820
and it's highly likely the situation is
gonna get much worse before it gets

605
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,070
better

606
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,920
and that means for us working in
security

607
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,150
well there's job security in securing
thank you
