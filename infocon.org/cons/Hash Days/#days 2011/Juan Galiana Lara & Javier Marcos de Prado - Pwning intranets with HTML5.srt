1
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,610
well hello everyone and my name is how
it might cause and this is my Cali hare

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,470
Hong hell ya know

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,560
%uh spent a stir fry BM and to we or
talk is set to

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,000
the title is spawning internet sweet
html5 prayer basically what that we are

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,470
going to percent is said his agenda for
date for their for the presentation

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,640
hold the attack works and what to wear a
whole we are going to discover stuff in

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:34,989
your

8
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,300
in your network and what eat right type
of information on what resources are

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,739
we're going to distract from your
infrastructure

10
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,420
and we're going to draw some diagrams
that your network administrator we'll

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,519
ask them for us

12
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:51,059
we'll ask us for them and we are going
to

13
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,549
once we have located stuff in your
internet we want to access that

14
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,580
at those those machines and we are going
to exploit some

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,710
some some services there on we're going
to show you the damn

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,740
and then we're going to some conclusions
if you have any questions just

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,030
jumping and we we try to as for them so
basically hair whole day

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,079
hold at that works am well and that
start of

19
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,580
with their diagram of what we are trying
to do adjust their

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:29,580
the sky here what's he's got here

21
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,870
want to extract information from the
security internet which are

22
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,260
some clients connected to that te secure
Internet

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,080
on he's sick or into farce at those
clients to

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,840
visit some weapon web sites that he
controls to run some coat

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,940
on with that code that we're on within
the Internet

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,110
he will be able to a.m. an hour

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,290
work around their firewall I D S IPS all
their passive hair

28
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,500
protection systems that can be in danger
in it because the internet the

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,720
securities in it and so

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,590
he is going to do so that through the
internet so this is basically there

31
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,030
they do. of this presentation we're
going to do that

32
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,989
let's start off with their what's html5
everyone is talking about html5

33
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:19,010
so well dis some of the reasons that way
you would use html5 from

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,299
of or any other users and want to use
html5

35
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:26,720
sayre ass backwards compatibility with
with HDMI for

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,569
and it's just on you set of their new
doc says some tax are deprecated to

37
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,580
indexing you talked out a with a new
edition singer I was keeping you APIs

38
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,630
on New York sess contact

39
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,560
it has also Newark or futures like come
us web-dl

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,180
your location an active media support
you you will you won't have to use hair

41
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,170
anymore they're flash talking and then
you will have you can access them

42
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,599
all the domains air from a different
domain

43
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,200
you send a Corsair the show starring am
requests

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,470
Arsenal escorts on what you will have to
eventually because the modern browsers

45
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,660
now they are shipping

46
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,830
their own their roses with their with
support on them

47
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,780
and this is their futures of the html5

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,620
with what we want to focus on and we
want to use WebSockets

49
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,020
course we want to use a web workers to
paralyze some just go out

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,379
aren't we all we want to air run and we
use in the new am

51
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:31,790
futures of their and David L scheme APS
now what we have

52
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,910
an html5 of saas-based of the attack

53
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,239
we are going to focus on beef n enuf and
if you know of

54
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,989
beef well-baby Phys said like cared it's
time for process gradation framework

55
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,599
is have a nice way to escape thing to to
scare developers when they are you tell

56
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,030
them you have a cross-site scripting

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,170
and they say yeah it's an annoying
pop-ups but by what had happened then

58
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,980
you show them what can you do with beef

59
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,300
its it's too can do really cool things
it works just like among

60
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,920
con control center for a hook Prosser's
the grocer acts

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,569
like I the so me of a botnet and there
with their beef you can run coat

62
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,769
on that machine and it has sausage on

63
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,989
at 70 their models talk to run stuff on
that weekend

64
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,079
stuck information from the row so you
basically a control air

65
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,229
their the brochure of the big dicked and
we are going to air focus on these

66
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,530
was said first session of that was
developed by the way dalkon

67
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,569
2005 it was developed using javascript
I'm

68
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:35,449
PHP the new person is beating in Ruby on
at the modus everything basically just

69
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,120
now we have html5

70
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,570
on them beef well how we're going to
kick off a dock

71
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,600
where what we want to do is just a spot
%uh person

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,160
a pass access to the Internet but
disconnecting the Internet

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,389
and then we are going to force him to
base its our web set a week on top

74
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,840
at that we can just run or call it that
or we can just use our

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,389
facing a pack to do that and that this
from social engineering and no which

76
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:03,169
forms

77
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,240
the guy visits while he's in the office
weaken their kickoff back from there we

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,400
can use and

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,449
you're in a short the nurse that decent
tweet their

80
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,470
Facebook any social a.m.

81
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,910
media or social engineering techniques
come can work for these the dead the

82
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,229
point here is to

83
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,800
to make the guy who he sweeping the
Internet run the code that we

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,810
we control and we are going to use beef

85
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,479
as the common control air center for
that and they all the tools that we

86
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,479
wrote for these

87
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,680
their being im their part of the file
ready as models

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,720
you can grab them and their next wrist

89
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,660
release which will be that temple
November

90
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,900
under was those small use wheelchair on
with the html5

91
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,410
I'm now what now we've with we we
decided we'd share which to set that we

92
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,530
going to add

93
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,280
use what what are we what we do

94
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,020
bad on

95
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,389
so well and we're going to use a hint
what

96
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,060
works here and into a footprint in that
Vick's release

97
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,680
im get as much information as you can
I'll and

98
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,009
about a network so we want to know a

99
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,710
in we aren't want to locate and it will
rent

100
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,720
a to what their victim is granted to so
once we have they

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,759
that network rent we will identify the
they have active

102
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,120
paid machines on the network and
internet host names

103
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,150
then a and we want to extract
information oldies

104
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,430
a machines so we will discover the open
ports

105
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,360
not then to the service running and well

106
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,550
and try to to obey seek a

107
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,900
a patent system painting and printing
and then

108
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,230
cryptography come up data network well

109
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,190
for but we are going to use beef pay the
process position framework

110
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,780
be passed to main a components

111
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,960
its oversight for this weekend and Ruby
and they

112
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,120
client-side that is run its roots in
their victim

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,500
hand well its miss you too a set of
models

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,270
here we have fun image that we can see
they're the least a foot boxers

115
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,330
we have week look we can see that we
have a big Tim

116
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,270
and its Benin five folks we a

117
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,990
inc's police came off at compartment to
manage who

118
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,240
brooks' when it comes out of the box
with a set of models

119
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,750
and we can see their their military so
we have different categories

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,600
exploits limit the spread display an
integration

121
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,290
network brosser and I got their earliest
I went you can as well

122
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,390
develop you know model what

123
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,470
its model has three fights air the first
one is so

124
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,300
conflict fight in which we said their
name

125
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,930
the car they worry I was basically their
conformational

126
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,770
for that mall the process in which that
modern rooms

127
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,560
the second one he sa refile here we have
to define their

128
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,940
and thereby meet us for that model
always sunny but on

129
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,530
fine because decor I'm at the ceremony
start fight to

130
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,700
to run and then that the last 58 is that

131
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,250
diverse group that was quick ok in which
we can use

132
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,180
all a.m. in features of a team in Fife
and use the code

133
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,960
is going to ruin into the victim brosser
so that is the important part

134
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,370
but face the for loop

135
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,020
and the sophomore who mmm cialis going
to network

136
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,919
that we can use to get day internal IP
address

137
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,180
of a victim so if we run

138
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,040
that modem eighth uses yes good to get
the internal IP address

139
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,670
and we can get here on the bottom we can
see an image

140
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,730
that the model that wants and a internal
IP address

141
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,250
have that big dick what another modem

142
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,770
we develop works is dead at the moment
what

143
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,490
this job like the pink one there will be
no script we're going to see no

144
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,700
how it works we can define I am

145
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,280
IP address hit with a couple of examples

146
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,930
it we read don't see if they is machine
is a life or not

147
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,140
well it and they will have the Moultrie

148
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,850
so it's been in all day network at every

149
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,950
what it works

150
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,620
and a call in from JavaScript to
identify started

151
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,670
effort but and heat

152
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,890
not it do not reply to this use index

153
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,910
to know many when we you when we have to
move

154
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,110
Dakota Prosser Lake Ablett we need to
use it to accept

155
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,950
but and he was touring debit but in this
case

156
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,390
in Asus haha adela so that method

157
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,830
a these interaction is not required so
we can draw on that cold

158
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,830
and this could we pruning depicting
brosser

159
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,230
without any pop-up or other so here we
can see that

160
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,740
we not only can specify arm on

161
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,839
a single machine we've gotten as well

162
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,930
be far aint so weak and is gone

163
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,520
I will look classy network in this
example

164
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,220
so in the image week and see that they
the model we didn't Raton

165
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,190
police might active licensing day in a
network

166
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,640
in

167
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,670
the time on a call in transfer printing

168
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,950
that this page was too this call
webservice

169
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,410
in the board eighty or eighty 80 so that
more than the scans for

170
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,730
up I T I had his unknown DRO the some
printers

171
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,449
well when we do our

172
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,209
ATB request from a brosser if he's
crossed my mind we can't

173
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:08,650
read the response so how it works

174
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,240
its it traced to

175
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,420
to load an image and then 100 and a
low-rent

176
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,910
on note event it text this ice of that
image

177
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,100
so the more the model has a database
with no new witness

178
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,520
on this basis and then tech support
that's nice

179
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,459
and if it's the same so and

180
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,199
didn't it knows that these for example
about to do because

181
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:42,390
that image was only in about 2 him

182
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,300
but will if we take this gun

183
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,720
all the possible should networks that's
not practical

184
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,160
we need out of time so what happen if we
have fun investing caused

185
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,400
in unknown IBX for example

186
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,160
I had known almost like internet the
company the calm

187
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,530
if we don't do to scan every to network

188
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,130
we can't acres that decent that AP right

189
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,459
so we're going to use a different
approach here

190
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:15,610
we're going to use a.m. in

191
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,240
yes enumeration when the in this
information is a known technique

192
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,780
that this around for a while I will use
space

193
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,890
on to key ideas

194
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,079
and it def is one is that must've the

195
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,250
important service high-fat the necessary
to dem

196
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,880
however the second one the most
important is that if we tried to do so

197
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,540
for example internet

198
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,220
you know we're brosser they were
bristling up n company that called

199
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,380
because they had the cooperation of the
DNA asked tombs

200
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,560
so what we have a program that in da
school cannot

201
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,060
resolve a DNS entries but we can try to
make russia

202
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,230
it to my request and with

203
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,890
custody in vessels sharing WebSockets

204
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,480
& wilts a huff have a look to the time
that

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,640
the request thanks it takes to come back

206
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,949
and depending on the time we can see if
thats Haas Texas or not

207
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:22,920
so it for example going to do resolve
known

208
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,680
them close like FTP internet

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,630
web survey or something it up so we
define addiction are you

210
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,720
that what in that case the tomb and

211
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,850
us one by default but you can and

212
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,060
provide another one so that it doesn't
but protesters to

213
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,380
try everyone every home in

214
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,640
and we'll get the least of the ones that
takes

215
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,449
more time to tour South so that means
that they the hot sex it's

216
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,170
I was thats common weal come up with a
list of

217
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:04,350
on their cognex so what now that we know

218
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,100
which much into life and cleaned up

219
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,829
being sweep or do Indians animation
techniques

220
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:15,880
we're going to try to accept more
information about this horse

221
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,140
so the next step is and

222
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,740
try to see which what's up in those

223
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,560
and a hard nips

224
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,520
so now you know we are which machines
are alive from the network

225
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,829
on even if they are you you didn't
figure out what was AP but you know that

226
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:34,569
but the machine

227
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:37,949
because the name is there so now that's
right to was gone what

228
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:41,209
parts those machines have open it's
their pups connie's

229
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,100
kind of are looking at what the building
what's the purpose of a building looking

230
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,079
at the door

231
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,430
is you see a very secure door in a bank
probably

232
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,810
when something is space securing their
its the

233
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,880
dollars should be and secure enough so
is something like that

234
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,190
the most known airport this country send
meh and then my peace I

235
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,180
great tool to run when you lie within
the network but when you are outside of

236
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,870
the network

237
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,130
it we are trying to kick off this a
docking are in a secure internet

238
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,470
so I'm up is not a is not an option so
we want to a get some

239
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,240
basic information makeup basic a less
fingerprinting or

240
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,370
service proving to see which services
are running in those machines

241
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,439
we are going to to use these and
sometimes

242
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,970
air when you find a port that appears to
be opened its

243
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,660
filtered that's also some formation
means that something interesting is

244
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,319
there

245
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,449
of I will come the protecting doubt so
it's its also information even if you

246
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:38,470
if you cannot access it's place also no
to

247
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,490
good to know on their but that that that
the

248
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,030
the point here is to get as much
information as you can and then

249
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,449
later on you can analyze that
information see which ways you can take

250
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:48,839
to

251
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,390
to kick off the attack and think that
that the interesting thing here is set

252
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,660
most to the internets

253
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,410
they are not filtered because they're
running test their developer training

254
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,300
call their performance tests their
reliability testing going on

255
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,370
say they if you start air the blowing
fire was alright yes

256
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,670
then they would they will head start
having perform any issues so

257
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,679
most of the internet they are not field
that's that's good for us because means

258
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,370
that there we won't have any problems on
anything

259
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,929
stopping no request on this is just
playing HTTP

260
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:25,689
an air-traffic so is to go to a disk or
services that they're

261
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:29,380
are there and then if you want to kick
off i pt then you you have about

262
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,740
information

263
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,030
the basic airports can we implemented
and we'll tell you is there the party

264
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,760
see their

265
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,939
open or close to you can enable our more
verbose mode

266
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:42,630
an hour knowing if it that the parties
said feel territory talk

267
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,939
too long to discover but that's a you
can you can do that

268
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,760
I we are taking their three different
approaches to %s counterparts

269
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,079
and we are going to use in their clap
clap in a classic approach

270
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,309
air which is set using am am

271
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,420
image and I from and attacks using the
source attributes

272
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,260
you can name you can specify where which
IP on which part you can there

273
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,870
you can know the source from and their
dots

274
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,850
bear complemented with JavaScript you
can name and process all the requested

275
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,829
based on their

276
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,250
is timing that there the whole thing is
is based on time so

277
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,410
based on their a dense on on

278
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,480
load unknown error then you can figure
out things

279
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,970
and then the html5 approach its use in
court and WebSockets

280
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,280
which they will let you and do basically
the same

281
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,640
and with Dallas give us where to handle
the Vince and that some problems

282
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,970
there to these approaches because well
WebSocket some chords that they have

283
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,780
they too they took some at those sums

284
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,070
things into consideration when the sign
that the thing so there are some

285
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,510
security measures for that so it you try
to add

286
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,809
to notes are known parts makers SH 22

287
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,650
it with that you know you cannot access
that because I'm pretty sure that there

288
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,370
is no

289
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,679
I thing there that you are looking for
so it's is blocked

290
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,780
and in Firefox as well not really can
block you

291
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,230
and to do that but that's not so problem
because said was set

292
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,690
discovered that was said explained by
Jeremy across min back in 2005

293
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,799
using a different possible down HTTP
then you can and work around this

294
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,220
protection

295
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,299
and add their in using Wireshark to see
how their

296
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:29,750
the parties can we are running looks
like it's a sucky este and my pet the

297
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,150
CPS can which is the

298
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,860
their simplest Scott you can run in in
in an map

299
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,150
so here as you can see this AM you can
you will have got

300
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,840
a.m. that image a Firefox if you try to
lower debt twenty-two part which is

301
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,780
known to be

302
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,890
for a different service you see an HTTP

303
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,510
and calls last class air IP or hostname

304
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,370
Kong 22 and let's look at some cars we
raise an exception on won't let you and

305
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,380
I know that content

306
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,530
but if you say FTP then

307
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,640
you got it and you can i still access
that scene

308
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,140
i think im it was still Firefox 3.6 it
let you to use their protocol go up

309
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,860
there

310
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,429
its now is not longer supported but and
it works really well using the Internet

311
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:15,250
Explorer

312
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,700
and Firefox Google Chrome and Safari on

313
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,820
as they said he sits pay some timeouts
there we we provide their the values for

314
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,929
our

315
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,580
and normal the internet that the they
work out of the box in different bro

316
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,230
searched but

317
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,010
you can confuse those for your own am
internet

318
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,780
so this is how with their their demo de
looks like it will be

319
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,549
under their network integrity and then
you can provide this con-

320
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,679
at their IP to scan or hostname then

321
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,290
you can provide their their specific
port to scan

322
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,840
if you put their default string it will
it will take

323
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,760
I the Follett least of parts of 180
parts

324
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,730
taking from their most used parts that I
and map uses

325
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,670
and it's also I am correlated with our
list of known services for those parts

326
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,520
so it will

327
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,679
if they're the part is mapped to a known
service it will tell you as well

328
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,210
on their am then you can view the timing
for their

329
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,940
their what's what respect for a close
part what respect for an open port

330
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,690
and then what suspect that what what
time to is but if I between

331
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,030
request because you don't want to run
all the whole thing at the same time

332
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,120
it will may be too it will erase some
suspicions

333
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,730
and the default least of the parts and
which is higher than 80 parts will take

334
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,049
to a scion and around five minutes so

335
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:42,970
a.m. is not a bot on their if you'll
provide

336
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,630
if you put your script in a website
which hair on sa

337
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,970
I V deal put up on I am cut is great
because sluts like seven minutes

338
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,490
so it did well why the depression is
watching at that video

339
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,330
and you can't start you can run your
scans the background and

340
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,130
is really really works well

341
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,720
so her now we have which machines said
we have connected

342
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,309
with said I am all the machines are
connected as well and we we discovered

343
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:09,860
them by

344
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,160
domain and which parts they have open
now we want to put them together and

345
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,660
then

346
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,200
really air provide the said diagram to

347
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,470
and it but sunburst some people that
bright Myers

348
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,250
mostly they don't want to see a list of
numbers and names so

349
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,480
you they want something graphics on my
candy to see you in a quien a quick look

350
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,669
hole where hole to hole to see what so
what's going on in this can so this we

351
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,410
just

352
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,470
added these to the just to make

353
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,559
that's just a may go to look good on AIM
it's a it's also based on their part

354
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,240
patterns

355
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,140
it's not basic OS surfing a painting as
well for example the

356
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,400
the party is 22 is detected us open is
most likely that I would that would be a

357
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,720
well in his box on if they're at your
best to be so open that would be most

358
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,410
likely I

359
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,540
a windows box on so on so this is how it
looks

360
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,429
its air but about like I'm glad it's all
based in the UK

361
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,929
JavaScript and CSS so it can be air
impact in any web sites or

362
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,190
beef as well as Common Council so

363
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,260
now we have located to the machines that
are alive

364
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,030
and the ports the services that are
running now we want to

365
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,740
start their having issues fun here so we
want to

366
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,059
have communicate with that and starts
biting things

367
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,669
okay so with and here we are

368
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:38,929
extract enough information i loading
internet

369
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,400
a but what we got they acted machine
sports

370
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,610
save his running and now we're going to
show

371
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,750
I a technique who that the cedar produc
'em

372
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,660
that that technique and permit us to
launch

373
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,260
HTTP request from my web browser but

374
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,220
29 SEP web service well 90s TV

375
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,120
and him so says so holla willing to let

376
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,520
and what what playing with balls forms
so what

377
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,809
when we grade up was formed been going
day peace

378
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,270
a by the fall UN-guarded but the

379
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,290
if you are this lake plain text Orton
will depart from the to

380
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,580
look good but we depart from the top
isn't couldn't they be used for file a

381
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,410
bloody

382
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,880
so well we can put whatever we wonder

383
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,020
and so we're going to who long to
request from the grocer

384
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,799
to our our service on the terrace

385
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,340
will ignore the lines they'd a CB hairs

386
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,270
but will execute a commons they'd they
are mister so we're going to put out an

387
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,650
example here

388
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,909
like when this and a led to many will
have fun assi rent

389
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:54,190
and we create we put in their post bail
old

390
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,899
ISA comments so if I E and talking here
about a SE

391
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,950
that can be whatever on their protocol
we

392
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,230
want what the server well every move the
bike build a CB he has

393
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,409
here we can see two of them the server

394
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:13,440
depends on their implementation on the
dollar per ANSI

395
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,700
a will ignore that a CBS

396
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,000
but then as test wants us to process it
to

397
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,950
proceed each line but when I rights
today I A siegel months

398
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,460
they has this ever will start to execute
that comment

399
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,399
so a say is that we're going to chain to
wreak

400
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:35,100
well into June joined a tunnel and then
send a message

401
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,480
to attend well I'm not going to leave
monitors here because we're going to

402
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,820
show that nap in a demo

403
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,580
later but we not only con

404
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,759
communicate with non STP mmm

405
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,450
to recess we as well can try to exploit

406
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,289
so as we have seen before we can trade
to recognize

407
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,380
if we are in front of our by

408
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,049
ever and we can do I

409
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:06,850
aborts come in so we can not that horse
to know what service upbringing

410
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,419
sorry for example we discover and
asterisk

411
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:15,340
or nighttime of saris and we have a list
of known

412
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,289
known able nobody's we can try to send
them

413
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:23,389
to a service to see if that would have
it the

414
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:27,820
a three cuz so what they be a hideous

415
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,850
and we can see that if there

416
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,649
so what that occur a.m. Hutton they had

417
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:38,309
that has access to this evidently
because he's in the Internet

418
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,259
but it controls a website that the clay
in these

419
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,620
and Bros so it can control that

420
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,110
the brosser of that victim that I could
force the victim

421
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,230
to launch a request to the to a server

422
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,220
with the piano and if they will have it
you getting sober

423
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,019
it will execute the show go there and
the shell or the shellcode can be

424
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:02,659
whatever

425
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,960
that I mean what's if it's about
connection

426
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,399
when they will know it because they're
the back on a show we conduct that

427
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,029
occurred

428
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,880
and Africa will have full control over
the server

429
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,440
and over there Internet so that's the
idea behind

430
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,509
but I was there a couple of

431
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:26,360
a in working exploits one of them

432
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,490
and developed by the way to corn a

433
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,149
we def in we see I am

434
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:36,779
at the sever Alice quite cool earth

435
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,669
and pecan exploit and get executors

436
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:44,700
I shall called a in the ethics ever

437
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,850
the he's not talking SDP

438
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:55,850
so what now sam for a demo

439
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,400
but this whole he went 19

440
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,270
launching beef the boater position from
work

441
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,590
hey well if provided with a

442
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,280
you I love the Ivan Bunin so what

443
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,940
this is that mean but and this is the
the website that that the carrots

444
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,700
a we see here on the on the left we'll
pass

445
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,600
they the victims now we're going to open

446
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,730
I basic demo these stop

447
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,870
and im in axe

448
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,640
as the we know of the victim so

449
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,090
in the Admin but in with a pair a new
big team

450
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,040
a few seconds there well what

451
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,900
and here we can see the information or
the victim

452
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,840
what the in we can see that

453
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,740
well their presence is them and the
brosser we can says when they didn't

454
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,280
they

455
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,610
ruins that brought us then that now they
be on its way early for us

456
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,900

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,150
but the Sun a second victim that we
connect

458
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,610
that is running into fighting in mock
and

459
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,480
what same approach weekend get
information about that big Tim

460
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,090
with so same as there are like brosser

461
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,190
begins is concise

462
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,700
custom enable hands-on

463
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,290
so well and if we go to the top

464
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:43,030
go months here week of all those small
ones we were talking about

465
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,940
and there's between different than what
is the

466
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,600
the broker one in horst Internet
Protocol category

467
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,110
the duration with Metasploit that what
its main developing right now

468
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,309
network at every there what the

469
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:03,730
a secretary for persistence few months

470
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,000
to try to and force

471
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,960
the victim connected I went for each

472
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,160
yet well and if the module has the brink
already it means

473
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,770
that this supported by in this Prosser

474
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,290
and if his red means that is not
supported or will take up to replace

475
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,120
using text so far for each beginning
with her father

476
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,840
up there so we can control individual
victims

477
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,840
and will launch

478
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,840
common to them so it would willing to
show their

479
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,960
the network contains took it so it fits
the fall this is their

480
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,760
disco internal IP address so what we
send that common to the victim

481
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,500
they're a big team executes to just too
cold

482
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,580
and then Redlands back that the string
to their to that mean but it's all here

483
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,919
with her and a beer this indeed

484
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,660
in this case and where every night in
the same machine but

485
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,780
a without peace there de beers of the
victim

486
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,470
then we come to it. two-room the

487
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,610
beach sweep a Mon for that we need to

488
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,150
to know before today in which network
east the victim

489
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,960
so we we said and for example 50
machines

490
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,980
and then yes he to execute

491
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,230
and what if we wait 20 seconds with us
to receive

492
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,630
there the horse that are a life

493
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:39,419
so his the least from

494
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,559
now and we're going to

495
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:48,030
room then the DNS

496
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,890
animation Madhu so well edamame

497
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,929
comes with arm the full did Charlie of
course names

498
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,210
but you can provide and what about you

499
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,240
you want so it same idea

500
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,419
it takes away to to launch day dick

501
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,390
more they come on but what you know when
we start to receive

502
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,520
that BNs entries that

503
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,960
are in the in trend of the victim

504
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,130
so what now one if we come back to the

505
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:28,130
to have been sweep comma we can get the
full list of

506
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,600
they host that I hope so well into BK

507
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,740
Lake went bad these one

508
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,150
machine I'm going to see you it

509
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:44,929
22 reports coming up on that you want
okay so now in airport scanning thing we

510
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:45,730
have you provide

511
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,909
day I P their list of parts I

512
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,630
we're gonna have removed the default one
going up right just a list of of ports

513
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,450
to I want to scan in that machine then
the timing

514
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,040
that I will leave five said default
values on

515
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,750
toward well it's a it went wrong in
their in the victim

516
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,500
and so I will start getting what say
what's where does values

517
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,000
it's important to note that the AM their
method where you see he has been seeing

518
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,610
in our

519
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,700
other tools percent it in our conference
is like for GS recomm

520
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,179
and which was set up performing I
WebSocket support this Connor

521
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,399
but that those tools where using only
their website it's math of or dick arts

522
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,220
math of

523
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,130
I we are using the three of them
combined for example there some time

524
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,250
said the WebSocket say results are not
very reliable and then you want to

525
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,700
to use in our technique to double
checked out so we are using these three

526
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,760
methods to

527
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,059
to check that 3d and that port is open
or sometimes

528
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,570
the classic approach will tell you that
that port is open then you hear on their

529
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,630
website gets

530
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,120
a will tell you that part is filtered
because it can access you can access it

531
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,909
this way it's a bit more a great

532
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:53,110
so that starts that's interesting and
then it will it will give you a bit more

533
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,140
of information

534
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,480
his hair well as you can see there it
gives you there the service which is set

535
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,340
if sport 22 its know he saw the 21

536
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,240
so now we know that that we have %ah set
of machines a number of machines that

537
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,140
are alive

538
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,780
with their few ports are open on the and
other machines that we want to just

539
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,360
and show them in a nice background that
I was talking before so

540
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,540
is that there you can name back there
the diagram that

541
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,890
and then just put that in your report
for your pen test

542
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,630
it is it's not about like you can yes to
and move it around and then make it look

543
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,440
assess you like

544
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,040
yesterday be happy to fight on the idea
as you can see you can see different

545
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,370
icons that there was because of them

546
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,570
the port sick and they always say a
basic finger painting

547
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,620
said the talks said his plays because
they're 22 is

548
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,909
he's there and us opened so

549
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:48,820
and that's their the basic OS am
fingerprinting that

550
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,320
them you can I just see with that with
these

551
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,380
diagram on but where does where there
too that we had developed

552
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,659
as markets of be fair for today

553
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:02,239
them for them for their mopping your
stuffing the internets

554
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:05,690
I now I'm gonna show you their whole
damn their

555
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,250
interparticle looks like a just the
Senate some commands to their

556
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,460
iIRC we we picked up their buyers you
protocol there

557
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,829
but Airways check that they all their
protocols depending how was the

558
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,139
configuration of the server

559
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,909
on how is there what's there what to how
many Command said run commands with a

560
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,379
low

561
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:26,550
an FTP lets you

562
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,599
around these things sense mmt pS Where

563
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,200
but it will have to be nine on some
important on there

564
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,190
there's still wear a.m. protocol that
with swallow all that to all the

565
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,839
heathers

566
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:43,500
so which is good and now we just
provided there there

567
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,750
the China that we want to send a message
that type of message

568
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,230
and

569
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,450
and then we just connected using RCA to

570
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,139
that server to Seafair and nothing works
on their

571
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:57,630
depicting will connect on his that thing
is legal because you can use

572
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:02,359
and have what is being used in there
with some but let's IRC to control their

573
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:05,550
which big teams they have hoped some
nice concede connects

574
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,960
it sends a message to this we already
know that that guy and he's being

575
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,050
I hoped into their into anything and

576
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,609
well that's pretty much it is is all the
paint on their beef

577
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:22,640
you can guess there get the coat on that
ride yourself is it will be the next

578
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,990
table with sickle traces the 3rd of
November so it's

579
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,060
10th of November day release and dust

580
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,150
the road it's on if you don't like it or
if you don't own the

581
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,260
if he doesn't work just give us a shout
them will probably fix it

582
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,670
and Afghan beef is sir quite I'm testing
tool dunno

583
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,790
very nice because it already provides US
without common control thing

584
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:50,109
on you can extend it and there it's a
it's it's okay on the housetop

585
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:54,630
buried long set of modern South already
implemented done with the Mets both

586
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,410
integration

587
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,590
it's quite %uh powerful tool and their

588
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,720
well and the good thing is that they all
this thing runs in the background of the

589
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,660
website done

590
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,210
is just JavaScript so known where a

591
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,609
anti bio so right Yes or anything will
race in your arms

592
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:15,840
and it's being a.m. already there some
concerts of sysadmin as we know that's a

593
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,170
good time we feel that these

594
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,990
and we had set rules to that and yes you
come

595
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,570
there because swear that the client
connects to the beef not the beef

596
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,010
connects back to the client

597
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,119
you can still cut some traffic coming
back from there but we are ready

598
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,470
are working on some a of education tools
to make

599
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,859
there the co 2 not be recognized by our
by

600
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:40,109
rules or not be recognized house I

601
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:43,180
the server so make it look like a
harmless

602
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,270
apache server that is giving you some
mac some information and

603
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,290
well the yester run the command to

604
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,260
ready at the user to that the URL and

605
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,590
well and okay

606
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:04,109
okay some conclusions swell

607
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:07,859
a.m. the internet surfers mean to be
secure but they're

608
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:12,480
the must've most the time the companies
rely on their the fire was that protect

609
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,720
the internets but they're

610
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,430
they give faxes to everyone who is
connected to the Internet

611
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:22,810
and Tween the whole internet so they can
access and forums that their members or

612
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,030
Facebook or tweet error Google account
or anything so

613
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,030
at many session can be picked up on

614
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:34,670
make them run coating their grocers and
you can also communicate with the

615
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,950
machines that are within that

616
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,150
I and their well we found that and one

617
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,320
right-wing good way to protect is just
running no skipping your

618
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,550
in your Firefox to 10 air not a low
Winnie

619
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,790
and have not known jobs could go to run
into your grocer but that was the only

620
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,330
way we found that these things can be
stopped

621
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,460
and this is the new futures of html5 so

622
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,590
well I with we we would really like to
abuse them

623
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,380
and where they're trying to push these
things forward without taking their

624
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,930
what's their consequences but

625
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:10,040
that's good fun I named my opinion there
also should block this kind of request

626
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,000
to spot

627
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,580
you know sometimes they don't and they
don't care

628
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,410
and wet am now is it

629
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,920
the here you have for at Twitter handle
so

630
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,940
of any questions give us a shout or Mia

631
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,380
near what has a question yep

632
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:35,380
yep

633
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,770
like the kayang kaya it's having a
distributed te thing to

634
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,290
chaired the session between with eBay
between different thinks

635
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:58,800
this is one of the things that we we we
have to look after its intended to end

636
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,630
it to the least using web workers

637
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,420
to paralyze their request so instead of
relying on anyone

638
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,750
website that is infected yes there there
to break it up

639
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,100
I then send it in the friend to many
time Sun you can do that but at the

640
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,740
moment is

641
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,460
only relies on if you have the top open
a window anywhere on

642
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,830
if the guy leaves obviously need
conditions lost

643
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,880
but there there are some argue some beef
for to a person make their pack

644
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,620
persistence

645
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,460
I K hiding that I could name the thing
in phnom in OMM

646
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,050
even

647
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,510
iframe or a kind of adult but not being
or

648
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,460
clickjacking to just two took the user
into he doesn't know really what's going

649
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:36,950
on

650
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,290
but yet that once the things that there
we are looking to

651
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:47,290
to implement was no question here

652
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,070
life now it's blocked 25 is blocked on
their

653
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,010
and that's pretty print that's not easy
to work around that you can for example

654
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,750
that work around a limited the meat of
their

655
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,859
and 22 but to the 25 seems to be blocked
everywhere

656
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:11,990
because of the spine issues so a fair

657
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,670
SMTP protocol will swallow then to
probable theme but the fitzco viewing

658
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,790
unknown stand apart

659
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:23,890
the and I was the only one that we
couldn't and workarounds the owner said

660
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,210
there's some long say if you go today I
am

661
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:29,300
went there the pot scanning how police
of parts

662
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,440
we just found them brute force in we we
have like

663
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,820
we put from co2 and 65 536

664
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,070
the maximum number of body can you can
configure and we yes that checked what's

665
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,859
the response was

666
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:46,280
and that's the least of Brockport we
know they are for WebSockets on course

667
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,750
and then five folks at the first or
because they're blocked its not too big

668
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,880
not named Natalie

669
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,150
so it says smaller but still we are
taking the biggest one

670
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,320
the bus then if it's blocked we notified
that the ports blocked

671
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,890
but still eating at the airport is
blocked for WebSockets on course

672
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:08,890
you can still run their the classic
approach

673
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,920
yeah

674
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,450
yes yeah it's a base that on there

675
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,760
obviously you can detect the response
but their

676
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,090
guests if you have their timing event
saying

677
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,930
the actor was raised because they have
short was not loaded

678
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,050
then you know that the commission was
not made so that's a close part

679
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,460
I dang if the connection attempt and was
opened

680
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,940
and that best on this there is no
question because that the protocol

681
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,660
conned

682
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,830
an SDS data communication open and come
close the connection but the the bottle

683
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,990
won't miss much

684
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,250
so they communication will stay open but
you can then control that using

685
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,750
WebSockets

686
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:57,750
course no no it's sad because it won't
connect with TP

687
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,850
the particle if you take if he wants to
connect to FTP than the protocol with

688
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,380
Matt's

689
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,150
and then it will ask the user but this
time is loading an image

690
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,940
which we'll land send you into our
research that these

691
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,000
the image which will you know try to
wrap it or not if its notes

692
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,430
then and it with then you can then
captured a

693
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:23,850
even for open port on if the parties
happen if it doesn't then this on a run

694
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,700
then you can capture that the sack
closed

695
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,390
so about no questions

696
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,700
wanna be around so if you have any
request in some or anything just give us

697
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,050
a shout

698
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:39,560
right thank you a good way
