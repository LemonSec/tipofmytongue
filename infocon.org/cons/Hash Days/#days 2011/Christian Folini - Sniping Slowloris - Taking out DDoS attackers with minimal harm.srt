1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,190
so I'm going to talk about
application-level the US

2
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,599
take their couple of network guys in the
room that problem is somehow solve

3
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:24,720
I'm not an expert network level

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,039
ever can get vacation layer and assured
a problem is not solved

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,739
for restart

6
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:36,420
the boring part my name is Kristen
fellini

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,500
as you can see in a photo of a
background in people his three

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,910
a try to are my money defending castles

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,350
been broke out in practice so I turned
to service and that

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,429
and turns out that's a lot easier to
make a living I defend web service for a

11
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,749
living I configured M&I repair damn

12
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:01,519
that much of I'm very based in Bern
Switzerland than I do

13
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,850
lots with project so

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,729
application-level the US 2006

15
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:12,830
we encountered and you

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,020
what we thought was very new I've attack

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,140
that you could do slow you could slow
down a web server pretty easily

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,850
from a single oath that thing a notebook
nowadays I

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,880
a youth smartphone and use very slow

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,810
request the 2006 we tried to raise a bit
of a Baroness

21
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,130
the Apache mating with we talked about
in democracy ready-made myth

22
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,760
people with the yada interesting thing
topic

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,910
but there is no business case involved
we will mention

24
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,310
activist political protest destruction

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,830
and the year interesting new topic

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,500
so with nobody relief from developer
community interested

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,310
and being and we were not willing to
make a big announcement

28
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,790
to release codes proof-of-concept attack
own

29
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,009
stuff so become been

30
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,170
continue to watch tootin see how did
developed

31
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,300
than a couple of years later as

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,930
toolkit name Flores came out released by
American hacker Arthur

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,910
make and ironically I

34
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,280
a talk to him about this as well but I
was not really mentioning to real

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,390
concept behind it too

36
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,040
this could be a thing is that at not my
dad it's not my topic at

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,690
yeah and then somehow stumbled over it
himself he really slow loris

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,660
again up now things are going to get
interesting we're going to see that in a

39
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,080
while

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,880
and yes we did not a year after its

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,709
this came out this is the financial
brand

42
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,250
Smith post making a press release saying

43
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,440
they're going to end their business
relationship with WikiLeaks Julian

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,940
Assange

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,550
and when we read this

46
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,780
mean you it's going to be fun
surprisingly

47
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,850
I was in one of those servers at bay in

48
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,500
just with both his money my customer so

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,620
after four years of thinking about this
problem

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,090
I finally saw the attack there was a
highlight in 2010

51
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,560
so

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,230
within minutes with both been attacked
by anonymous

53
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,250
court yesterday yeah make go heap on
Form

54
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,900
Finland he talked about the the pacs he
mentioned bees I he mentioned

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,170
american express men to pay Paul Bui for
adults with post minutes affairs with

56
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,650
both been on CNN to

57
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,700
at your

58
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,340
and has been at least with Flynn all
over the media

59
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,689
and a let you watched this photo for a
minute

60
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:02,099
think this a explains

61
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:08,239
quite a lot about this group this is
very chaotic

62
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,930
at Regina lot of different people

63
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,959
they seem to be somehow anonymous

64
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,320
somehow not really but a bit

65
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,729
and then they dress up as you can see
there

66
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,590
their suits and that ironic

67
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,789
evian their him you for the farm

68
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,389
is not a business case they're here for
fun they've

69
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,820
they want to enjoy himself and if this
band or this gang is coming up to you

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,530
this going to be quite a party

71
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,889
and Barry chaotic

72
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,610
and if you have a big corporate website

73
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,919
and a chaotic dang coming off to rate
seeded

74
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,900
whatever they do they will be able to
harm you somehow

75
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,130
some way and you'll have a hard time to

76
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,599
being clearly made of this party know
the true with you

77
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:10,300
of course this is the modern age

78
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,880
anonymous is fairly open their
recruiting worldwide

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,430
their true team your Twitter they
invited to the IRC

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,380
so we went to chat with them this is
what they said

81
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,949
think the Firth statement crucial one

82
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,449
they're not here for the money all they
want destructing

83
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:32,690
your money your defender they wanted
struck your business

84
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:39,690
with all they have

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,090
and this is how it turned out I'm not
able to tell you too much about

86
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,120
with both Saidapet but this graph

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,289
went through the internal censorship so
I can show you that one

88
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,139
this is network link with both

89
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,330
is a standard a they

90
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,330
clearly there's a daily recommended

91
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,320
business with Salam the local customers
they sleep during the night

92
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,780
with goods within are supposed to do

93
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,780
then you have a calm weekend than your
standard Monday

94
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,910
and then at three o'clock in the
afternoon yet the press release Savannah

95
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,650
traffic supposed to go down

96
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,479
it goes up and

97
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,669
then what I think is a fairly nice

98
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,340
move by anonymous doing tonight

99
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,340
they slow down but then after the
Tuesday morning they hit with both with

100
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:42,930
all they had

101
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,620
and there was a extremely busy day
important here

102
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,650
this the baseline this is the total ban
with

103
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,370
they hit the top with the attack

104
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,020
and one note here

105
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,389
this is the remaining 10 percent what
you see

106
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,409
ninety percent of the attack is already
filtered out

107
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:08,440
by the ISP that's the network guys

108
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,389
they note how to handle this stuff but
the remaining

109
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,630
10 percent hit the third and they
consume depend

110
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,199
stale within the big picture of the
attack

111
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,130
yes please yeah dad callers are
different parts

112
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,900
at

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,320
within the big picture of attack most
def the attack

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,900
I think most US attack now if they're
still met with me

115
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,570
but application-level the US

116
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,740
is on the rise within the big picture

117
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,099
and within the big picture

118
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,930
application-level the US most the vid

119
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,159
is flooding HTTP requests most of it is
hammering your reps on

120
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,260
a lot of it is people clicking reload on
your website that works for large-scale

121
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,360
and if you do this with SSL and have a
big political group behind it

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,450
that's a lot of requests but I'm
focusing

123
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,620
on the small part within

124
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,650
that's the request delaying slow loris
type

125
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,919
no hammering but fairly smart

126
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:25,919
will request yes

127
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,160
yet here we had a good defense

128
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,220
here we took down the shield again

129
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,130
because with annoying in practice and
another guy tried it out

130
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,430
put up the shield again for helping our
he went away

131
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,940
them thing with federal though

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,060
Lori or request to me

133
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,570
you know the situation here in shop

134
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,910
during the Q somebody in from is paying
the bill

135
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,750
very small coins a lot

136
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,180
of a very small coins and the bill

137
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,290
the bill can be big and you can provide
it with

138
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:18,290
literally as many small condoms you want
their three characteristics you

139
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,480
birth

140
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,980
the lady hear it from consuming 1q

141
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,980
his hand in points she can do to

142
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,330
is it illegal what she's doing anything
that

143
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,920
anybody think that's illegal no she's
perfectly allowed to do that

144
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,450
this is protocol Compline

145
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,150
second characteristic

146
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,730
lady here is in few bit

147
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,560
if somebody's doing this on purpose to
you

148
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,600
you're at the cashier then you'll
realize

149
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,120
hey somebody's trying to slow it down
and then you escalate your alarm about

150
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,140
talk to people

151
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,480
you can solve the problem killed

152
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,080
lady at catcher she's not stupid

153
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,160
I take it your server is you

154
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,890
based my servers are stupid

155
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,140
and is happy third characteristic

156
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,050
you're not killing a big shop chain

157
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,200
with this attack you slowing down

158
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,000
cue you slowing down Penn cues is
slowing down the shop

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,580
but you're not able to raise a
nationwide

160
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,090
attack on shop chain or worldwide the

161
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,120
and if you do there people around to
help you

162
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,440
with it let's go

163
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,020
to the online world Smith

164
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,290
sopped angel let's take me cross for
example they have a lot of shops

165
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,910
but have one online shop Smith both

166
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,470
one online banking admit

167
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:24,470
a lot accuse but saying no URL and the
thurber

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,040
what very stupid but the same thing

169
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,870
as in the real world loan request our
protocol compliant

170
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,970
but I mean

171
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,500
with this is with the protocol
compliance low request

172
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,800
you can do you can have a catastrophic
effect

173
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,480
on an online server mileage standards
city in

174
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,140
at a bang or in the shop is harmful

175
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,160
bit of media attention but is not really
a problem for us

176
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,740
for to come company behind not like that

177
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,020
the online world with single webshop
you're pretty much screwed

178
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,930
this happens on your site there is why

179
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,430
this is the Apache web server

180
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:19,430
status page that's not status I tell you
can the lady at the cashier is not

181
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,080
stupid

182
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,040
that's Apache in default configuration
he is pretty stupid

183
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,150
you but question marks

184
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,740
are and the reading this is about
information should be

185
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,650
their name for Mason he doesn't see it
is blind

186
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,300
this is my get talk starts

187
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,420
side five seconds afterwards there is no
page anymore

188
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,440
is no longer able to delivered

189
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,070
they dispatched to you so it for Earth
you see

190
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:57,070
fairly nothing afterwards you completely
blind one thing you see here this is the

191
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,250
CPU call

192
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,450
0 no CPU happening

193
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,800
if you look at the i/o on the server

194
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,450
not a let know I'll

195
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,740
to look at the log files off the server
nothing no request to me

196
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,240
the only thing the gifts a clue is next
up

197
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,930
he's begun action yet a lot of these be
connection

198
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,130
nothing happening in a slow loris case

199
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,460
and slow loris only proof of concept you
see a lot of TCP connections from the

200
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,330
same server

201
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,530
on the same Klein the what IP address
2000 connections yet

202
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,930
sure did at the fair game but in the
distributed case the chorus

203
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:49,790
you have no word attack you with more do
with repeat the connection

204
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,030
and that's why points very difficult

205
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,230
you by picking be good the bad guys

206
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,290
so this is the base problem and that's
what people tell me about it

207
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,920
even dressed it's a fame in the patch
security guy would tell you

208
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,900
his big book patch security one
paragraph above a

209
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,610
the cage level the US very difficult

210
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,630
thanks Yvonne

211
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,150
fun but too much that at our snake and
in a bug report

212
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,579
regarding slow loris to Apache they
would say yet we expect that

213
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,050
thank you and Apache actually has a

214
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,280
at the US I'm page

215
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,720
other when I read is the first time 2006
it's a dead thats

216
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,910
that's the thing your it tried to do
while you watch is over die

217
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,040
but nothing on the page helps you so
much

218
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,079
slow loris it's your debt for an Apache

219
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,390
at least in slow loris told him out
meanwhile

220
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,730
there's been a bit of movement a a
complete of the word

221
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,160
so back to the core of the problem we
have

222
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,390
a problem 3 from creation here a repeat
the quote

223
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,290
defense is about telling good traffic
from bad traffic

224
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,980
and bad traffic makes looks like good
traffic

225
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,610
and your bride difficult

226
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,579
and three of the German term is bit
better it's

227
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,860
when chef you divide good guys

228
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,230
months i'd the bad guys on the other
side clear-cut

229
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,440
without cutting the feed of good got
false-positive

230
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Armenia and false-positive are big
problem

231
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,899
so defense

232
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,899
you have to note to self I did in a way
that's a medieval quote

233
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:53,310
for me the list in the room you have to
know yourself

234
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,490
for you can defend you have to know your
architecture

235
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,639
the US attackers will look for
bottlenecks

236
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,819
in your set-up you can wait until they
found the bottleneck

237
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:11,209
are you can try to find a bottleneck
yourself you have to know the prodigal

238
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,800
here we're talking about a HTTP which
EPS

239
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,360
a everybody knows HTTP

240
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,480
but you really know it by heart HTTP
looks

241
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,550
like a very simple protocol but it is
not

242
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,959
ATP really really complicated

243
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,870
in the details take for example

244
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,709
HDB keep-alive most people will tell you
that

245
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:41,470
edge to keep alive is a good thing been
now think about the attack type

246
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,470
h2b keep-alive

247
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,940
makes TCP connection last longer

248
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,689
HDPE is a stateless protocol where you
would say ha

249
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,810
request response gone and now it's
because people I've transformed is

250
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,899
in to a protocol with opens then
connection

251
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,329
HDB keep-alive

252
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,579
makes this book makes a a good

253
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,120
customer look like a slow loris attacker

254
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,199
on the network level it's pretty bad

255
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,610
I'm of renovated to keep alive fall

256
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:23,520
other reasons as well would want to say
DS even if it's too simple protocol

257
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,870
you have to know it by heart if you want
to defend itself because the attacker

258
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,330
they will find a weak spot in your
set-up in the prop you have to know your

259
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,140
application

260
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,880
the problem here is nowadays people
don't know application they installed a

261
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,260
it used to be difficult to integrate
applications

262
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,570
and during the integration process you
would learn your application but

263
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,210
nowadays when things are so simple

264
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,909
you just install and birth and then get
acecomm

265
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:53,440
and then you start to learn your
application you look at the log files

266
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,730
probably for the first time

267
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,570
and you not even sure what is the Packer
here

268
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,900
and what is by the customer so you need
to know the application

269
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,220
when is the mint condition

270
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,530
when there is no attack going on and
them in the attack comes to see i

271
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,280
this is bad behavior this is not
supposed to happen don't

272
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,570
start to to make friends the replication

273
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,740
during unpack know your customers

274
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,610
you've seen the network wraps with both
with post know if the

275
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,840
the customs Bradley Bell one thing I can
tell here

276
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,470
their Swiss thats thats

277
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,690
that helps because their local customers
that local IP addresses

278
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,080
big big advantage if you're a

279
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,429
operating worldwide globally things a
bit more tricky

280
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,980
with this post of the new customers work
doing today

281
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,940
they go to sleep in the night so we can
repair service tonight

282
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,380
and tomorrow we have a new game know
your allies

283
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,309
and the phone number chances are that
you're not confronted with the US

284
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,820
attacks every day there are people who
specialize in that

285
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,500
you should make contact with them if
you're a big Swiss Corp

286
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,890
melanie is your friend that the federal
sides with them to help

287
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,659
big sites unfortunately they are not
helping the small fights

288
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:25,700
but that's a financial problem on their
behalf

289
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,530
but you should know a phone number where
to turn to

290
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,330
when the shit hits the fan you have to
know your tools

291
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,000
in the end you defend

292
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,020
with tools and a selection of tools
you're not defending with

293
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,690
support contract you defending with
somebody

294
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,200
on the server who knows the application
who knows the setup

295
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,210
and who knows how to combine things

296
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,020
to build it but defense there is no
silver bullet here there's nothing that

297
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,179
installed months problem solved you have
to be adaptive

298
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,040
in your defense you have to analyze the
attack

299
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,580
and then try to build up a defense
against it

300
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,760
and the is in means in the end that you
need an expert

301
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,500
onside and he has to know you

302
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,649
decide very well and then of course you
should have a defense plan

303
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:24,309
prepared as we have found out about this
attack back in 2006

304
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:29,320
we had ample time to build up a defense
plan

305
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,600
there management most not very

306
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,820
on of the defense plan but at least we
had it in the drawer

307
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,260
and when the attack came we could pull
it out

308
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,280
present to management and his help too
big to you because

309
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,860
without a defense plan what I call

310
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,700
the a headless chicken mode kicks in

311
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,600
anonymous is already a very chaotic and
if you're a very chaotic to Dan

312
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,830
elk Campbelltown at the know your
enemies

313
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,149
indian aunty with case this is easier

314
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:05,500
than with other threats their public

315
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,320
they announced their a pack to earth on
Twitter

316
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,899
look I'm I'm launching Flores now I'm
doing Rudy

317
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:16,860
I'm doing boy please join

318
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,470
that help

319
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,520
so yet the motion I'll

320
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,210
let's start with the basic defense think
about using an event-based

321
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,669
web server point with Apache is that

322
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:34,830
Apache Bynes a server process

323
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,159
a rather a server threat to PCB
connection

324
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,169
for the number of PCP connections

325
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,280
defines how much so rip thread or rum
you will meet

326
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,409
how much RAM going to be consume

327
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:54,659
that is not very smart nominee that's
the way I bet he works

328
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,040
the event-based Apache branch is
experimental

329
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,210
and doesn't do SSL that's not an option
you could turn into a different web

330
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,049
server

331
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:06,220
was handled this in a more SmartWay

332
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,720
anjing flight HDPE me maybe even ISS

333
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,830
but they have other limits of course I'm
still on the patchy

334
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,500
at the different evolved

335
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,159
then of an option think about routing

336
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,040
through an external specialists the
people around who know

337
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,450
the US very well

338
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,690
chances are if you're a Swiss bank
you're not supposed

339
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,820
router Traffic to an external
third-party

340
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,840
but it's an option for some people then

341
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,780
come back to HB keep-alive understand HB
keep-alive

342
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,240
know what it really means your side and
decide if you really need it

343
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,530
are you to say we don't need it and then
somebody comes up and say we absolutely

344
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,570
needed

345
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,280
because the application so crap and then
be enable it

346
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,610
lower your time outs the apache on a web
service come with the huge

347
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,690
barry big time out for me three seconds
like

348
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,299
sounds like the smell you not 300
seconds like the default

349
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:18,700
reach sec this works in practice re
second is all it takes

350
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,809
then use mud-brick timeout comeback that
after birth

351
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,450
standard Apache module now more break
time out

352
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,770
the Apache response to slow loris

353
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,260
look at deal mark US that the Swiss
smart you'll

354
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,260
but possible been there that's cool mod
QS

355
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,169
if there is something fairly close to
feel the bullet it's more QS

356
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:47,720
think that's the most versatile thing in
this regard

357
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,950
deal I P their IP

358
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,320
bomb if you look at and

359
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,530
nets that the newer upon the IP
addresses there too number

360
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,780
but adding the country the location to
IP address

361
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:08,290
its so much more information if you know
where we customers sitting and suddenly

362
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,389
you have hundreds of connection from

363
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:14,490
that's all Malaysia then you know that
something is amiss

364
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,530
Gail I P so easy but a single package
and the database

365
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,559
the great thing down to the basics nets
that he should be done

366
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,139
even if it is and trip the traffic these
two tools

367
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:32,070
help a big deal there IP blacklist thing
that's what you want to do

368
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,139
in the end it turns out you want to
blacklist on the server

369
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,860
blacklisting on the perry made her shut
up people the good thing

370
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,010
but the big corporations the not so far
that's difficult

371
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,679
setup did service should be able to
defend himself

372
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,770
we were /url reluctant first

373
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,790
but even in this the pack in yen this is
what worked

374
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,389
very nicely the server has to be able to
attack you and defend himself and then

375
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,129
you can propagate the IP addresses

376
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:04,369
somewhere out into perry made ISP
probably

377
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,610
look into what security even if it is
not an anti-us

378
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,800
to it has a couple of interesting
directive

379
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,309
at looking to mod back towards another
interesting model

380
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:18,850
which might help and general

381
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,260
idea coming back to age pp

382
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,850
Brett the bottom known fortunately for
it so

383
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,059
think about the architecture think about
replication

384
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,369
and then you realize a

385
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:38,629
for unauthenticated users all we have
are small request

386
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:41,909
but within the application once they
have authenticated

387
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:45,500
wi-fi ludlum

388
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,379
different there is no point in accepting

389
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:55,510
big post requests beyond 100 bytes

390
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,230
foreign on the pen to paper users all
who you can accept for a non up

391
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,480
indicated user

392
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,550
is the login form with 100 bytes in the
post

393
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,700
but a kid most service will actually
accept

394
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,710
up to the limit like one megabyte
because the file upload

395
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,710
but few bit you to try did

396
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,230
separate listings not authenticated user

397
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,629
talking the whole world my good users

398
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:24,240
they have potential that house

399
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,470
bill you sir so

400
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,790
basic defense nowadays you worked with
my security

401
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,820
limit the number of connections into had
to face

402
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,600
we accept 5 connections for thing like
your press

403
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,450
in the body phase accept another five
connects

404
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,710
so if we have flown or is the Packer who
will always

405
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,240
they in the head and face he's out

406
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,970
but slow loris only prove concept that's
not distributed

407
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,860
against a distributed a pack this won't
work and another problem

408
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,960
corporate proxies don't show individual
IP addresses they do net

409
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,200
of course saw your FB corpse

410
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,820
connecting to your cooperation they all
use the same IP address

411
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,070
you shut them out with this doesn't
really work

412
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,770
practice so well Modric timeout
mentioned that

413
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,510
that Apache standard defense nowadays

414
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,909
I think that's better this is number of
connection

415
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:32,820
this is Leng a connection

416
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,490
he would say but had to face one second

417
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,100
body face thirty seconds in total

418
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,149
and afterwards there are more correction
this command

419
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:48,669
what they after every 30 seconds we want

420
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,010
the so in so many bites problem here

421
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:58,990
a dedicated and Nana 10 pk did users are
in the same bucket

422
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,129
second problem low more about lines

423
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:06,679
began the customers the biggest problems

424
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,919
at the end of the world the very slow
connection

425
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,860
they need your support and not being
locked out from inside

426
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,480
so these tools problem is

427
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,159
they're putting all the customers in the
same bucket and everybody gets to have

428
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,800
the same length the number of
connections

429
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,980
now you combine lot of different tools

430
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,119
their one good thing for example to the
hint

431
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,690
yet said you have a lot of net stuff
connections but nothing in taxes lock

432
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,710
Isabel time between if somebody does a
lot of connections with you

433
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,710
but never request chances are that he's
in the Packers &

434
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,970
but you have to do is combine

435
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,330
the 22 and this is bird

436
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,840
circuits in up to now you could say yeah
we do this on the firewall

437
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,649
et cetera et cetera now

438
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:06,850
the server the only guy who knows the
access law he's the only one

439
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,899
who knows what is actually happening
here

440
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:16,090
and if it is in cryptid that even more
true

441
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,020
other deals tools they do full request

442
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,889
but Ben they don't fetch follow-up pages

443
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,929
anonymous like to look like that they
hammered

444
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:31,100
the index page all the time but somebody

445
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,149
question the index page not getting the
CSS file

446
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:39,559
that not about the customer maybe a
crawler

447
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,669
another nothing else JavaScript image
file don't like

448
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:48,700
that gives you an indication that could
be an attacker

449
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,169
you already see that could be false
positives but still that's an indication

450
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:56,879
general thing and for me that's a very
good indicator

451
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,360
you take the lifetime apologies to be
connection through replication

452
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,580
and ending calculate the medium and if
the median runs out

453
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,129
then you're under attack because as I
told you you very blind

454
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:11,809
20 during the attack but that's a value

455
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,369
which held you usually BBC four seconds

456
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:18,470
a lifetime and if we had 35-second

457
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,990
charms are under attack but otherwise
very difficult actually

458
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,990
tell if you're under attack

459
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:31,169
good and then get bounced off money poor
I'll be locked together

460
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:35,119
combine them and then

461
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,080
identified the attackers

462
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,450
and kill them failed to ban is your
friend here

463
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,000
or any sort of all the blacklisting
threat so and I'm presenting

464
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,139
to you a script

465
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:56,510
stuff that called flying frog if slow
loris is already a very stupid name

466
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,270
I came up with something even more
stupid

467
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,480
imagine flying frog that animal actually
insists

468
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,799
exists like a slow loris that actually
exists even if like prague this

469
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,990
and he who is over it is because actions
and the log files

470
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,049
and then he identifies something he
picks it out like a frog eats a mosquito

471
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,240
very selectively

472
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,429
features a frock

473
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:31,230
has money pouring too thin requests so
he built up is all nets that table

474
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,770
problem is more than you on a UNIX
system

475
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,940
it will not tell you how old a PC
Connection its

476
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,340
police not me so

477
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,429
if you want to know th of peace between
action

478
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:51,790
you have to do your own statistics

479
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,799
and the Frog always call kph of he's
begun action that these

480
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,399
enabled the money to re-up a vindication
lock the access log

481
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,320
the application see who which IP address
is able to provide credential

482
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:12,320
these are my customers abadi elders
under suspicion

483
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,830
and enable the said report to meet in
connection lifetime

484
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,909
overall global leave mood sifting

485
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:23,809
median connects like I'm goes up alarm
we could be under attack

486
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,200
or not people report

487
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,580
blind eye peas maiden with more
connections

488
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,119
than the limit allows

489
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,179
you do the same thing here

490
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:41,290
but

491
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,740
is limited is configurable

492
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,340
come to that and then you also report
IP's

493
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,159
with connections there Alderden to limit
allow

494
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,630
that's the more direct I'm up

495
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:04,450
again you're able to do very granular
configuration to this

496
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,429
so these limits and conditions can be
configured

497
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:12,130
easily as the config file though

498
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,190
we say basically you get paid
connections find IP address you get 10

499
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,960
connections

500
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,370
but if recovery Switzerland you get
twenty and if you're attending Katie you

501
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:20,820
can

502
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,570
100 corporate proxies will help
indicated

503
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,980
and felt they will have requests
professions with authentication

504
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,289
and immediately the IP addresses are
allowed one hundred

505
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:37,480
he's be connection the chance to look
big corporate out

506
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,440
for my corporate reduce without actually
knowing who the carpet or

507
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,440
and individual time out he would say

508
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,450
you get five seconds for your request

509
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,000
yes the cell I give you 10 if you come
across with lynn

510
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,549
I give you 20 seconds to fulfil your
request because we privilege

511
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,710
local customers if Europe educated

512
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:05,630
bed you can do your file uploads the
52nd and if you attend to get at you

513
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,830
come from Switzerland I give you 100
seconds to

514
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,270
the finish your your connection

515
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,299
a request an EC now now we get granular

516
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:19,000
configuration weekend

517
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,989
divide our customers or clients

518
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,169
at this is what helps like this we can
do

519
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:32,190
strick different Jason at this has to be
done

520
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,950
on the server because only 2 Thor is
able to look

521
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:42,950
into the application and see who is
actually up indicated and who's not

522
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,510
yet at this script this is very can
download it

523
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,510
today is the first day of the release

524
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,899
and I consider it all for code quality
this been pestered

525
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,520
this is already a

526
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,240
been youth during a penetration test as
a defense

527
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,609
help and

528
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:10,089
if some of you guys would download that
and brought me some feedback

529
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:13,230
that will be fun

530
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,529
and the yeah that's it from my part

531
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:22,839
and still I've announced in the in the
program that I will also talk about

532
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:28,850
medieval costly fence so for him the
list amongst you

533
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,589
footpath and their cases within power
than people Cardinals are usually

534
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,220
clockwise anybody know why

535
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,560
day

536
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,650
yeah the and you have to visit homepage

537
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,430
of your shield facing outside

538
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,140
that's the point so that should be
covered by now

539
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:58,140
and i'm open to questions and feedback

540
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,580
so the first arm the birthing your
thinking about is Matt of course

541
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,890
and you already Corrib ap a gf problems
with

542
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,820
whitelisting Nadal IP's like I don't
know GPRS

543
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,830
a gateway to the south where you have
both indicated and

544
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,660
potentially malicious klein's and how do
you

545
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,120
you just assume the dish you enough for
those

546
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,760
which have both um good and bad plans
behind them or

547
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,910
how do you country that K at

548
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:37,730
the pack with all individual attackers
were not the problem so if a couple of

549
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,340
the Packers sneak into Switzerland we
could happen theoretically

550
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,040
with still not indicate European
communion but that could be attacked

551
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,810
with the monster

552
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,640
actually be a 25 had and

553
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,660
add but that's not the problem problem
is

554
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,420
anonymous operating globally and they've
been thousands of them and a few

555
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,160
individual

556
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,350
warmth a it's a individual

557
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:08,160
all negative are usually not the problem
if I see somebody with one thousand he's

558
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,200
become actions

559
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,200
that's fair game isn't it more questions

560
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,980
a group another 10 minutes

561
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,720
global banks no yeah

562
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,450
no an a

563
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:39,349
is say here you need to combine

564
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:42,450
his tools you need to come up

565
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,900
with the individual approach try to
think a bit

566
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,150
me today I P is very very strong

567
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,670
if you take this

568
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,200
and flew to Gail IP stuff

569
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,890
still very good to make it

570
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:09,089
to put nah not indicated users not tend
to Katie user in different bags

571
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:13,000
is still very very strong and people not
doing that

572
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,380
mean DIDS viral not able to do that
server has to do it the server

573
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,450
has not been instruct them up to now a
days people are not using

574
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,680
these agents on their servers and

575
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,060
mean maybe application-level DDoS is not
the most

576
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,060
imminent problem me to race

577
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,079
of somebody being hit by that extremely
small

578
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:43,079
but then the we would not have had
anticipate that

579
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,369
you never know when

580
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,990
you suddenly hit like Obama's and then
you have to pack

581
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,180
so it's with a at to preparation of the
defends

582
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,200
is not high priority because its battery
not very risky

583
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,220
but when you're actually hit that it's
really bad

584
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,020
and that's that's a really that's a mean

585
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,160
risk situation know tom's

586
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,750
big impact hard to get money for

587
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:19,750
situation yes

588
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,400
again there's mmm there's been work

589
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,200
trying to fingerprints a ATP clients
based on their

590
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,710
arm the avail what headers

591
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,869
breast terry has a book in which ordered
a are in arm especially

592
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:42,220
people claim they are I E have been
there not do you use something like that

593
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,660
too

594
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,859
try to differentiate good from bad
customers or good from bad request as

595
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:46,420
well or

596
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,460
has hasn't this been necessary at I i
am.

597
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,950
I did a similar presentations with cyber
storm

598
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,589
in in May and there are mentioned that
march through a food

599
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:00,680
at the other talking your session did
something like that

600
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,810
even with their chip at security guy and

601
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,220
initial develop promote the curity he
does SSL client fingerprinting

602
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,650
at all if things are far as experimental

603
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,270
but a mean

604
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,520
yeah that kinda works %uh on

605
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,530
obviously should work Lloyd attack tool

606
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,700
will happen on fingerprint but then

607
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,920
i think thats that's a a dead broke
pretty soon

608
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,960
a half-court the attacker can imitate
and brother

609
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,280
and the modern tools they're running

610
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,109
inside the browser so the next
generation Lloyd up going on with

611
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:45,700
network is to have a script based and
that were in practices books like

612
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,520
joined the attack your you're on their
rep

613
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,310
on the website your part of the pack
immediately and JavaScript in the

614
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,020
background executes

615
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,500
the attack we r

616
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,040
a remote distributed structure you're in
there in the

617
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,089
voluntarily botnet by clicking on the
URL

618
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,319
and then there is no fingerprint and
more then you're down to

619
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,740
stuff like or have it here

620
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,819
than don't fetch follow-up

621
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:24,119
CSS JavaScript image files and bad
request

622
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,940
structure other ideas are get request

623
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,480
in relation to post request in an
application there should be a standard

624
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,349
ratio

625
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:36,310
between the two if you know the
application like ninety percent should

626
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,270
get request

627
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,950
but if the kindest doing only post
requests that about thats

628
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,190
very special Klein isn't it maybe their
fault positive

629
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,109
of course but a this is not to defend

630
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:52,810
defends which you always active this is

631
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,220
when you come under attack then you fire
up shield

632
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:02,140
and then you accept the couple a false
positive yes please

633
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,270
you had a question no pueden

634
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,780
within get requests and post requests on

635
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,849
like modern like for instance Google Web
Toolkit applications

636
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,560
which usually handle all the Ajax stuff
where POST request so

637
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,670
that might not be the key issue to
distinguish

638
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,210
that she pens on your application and
you have to know your application

639
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:34,210
somebody that he is barred somebody's
mom really depends

640
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,779
you have there is nothing else say close
at

641
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:45,589
thanks for listening
