1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,780
I hi everyone so that's me

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,770
I work for Lars an

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,160
recently we talked about very secret a
pen testing in Derby Conn

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,820
I capability to and contests and not
beat up on or call for a while so much

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,039
that I'm bored a bit so I know you guys
are bored with it

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,989
client-side stuff open source
information gathering stuff

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,390
so we're gonna talk about I

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,680
why we're here is to talk about and
over-reliance on his boner body scanners

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,080
and commercial contest from work so a
lotta times

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,670
we throw arrange into the phone scanner

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,620
we import at and Metasploit pro our core
impact or whatever and if it comes to

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,050
happen nothing like up good

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,850
clients get to go I'm so much said a lot
of times a girl I get it doesn't say

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,280
exploitable then we just don't try which
carry on with her

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,969
weather day on and I found in my
experience that clients can fail to

16
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,530
remediate a lot of those low

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,149
in me and things and so reasons I mean
to can open to suggestions what I've

18
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:13,970
come up with is you know they don't have
enough time to do it cuz if it got 500

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,520
highs and 3,000 Lowes Home something I
take care the heights person

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,569
by the time I get no the highs the next
month's come around a new giant stack up

21
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,000
on ability results has been displaced on
the desk

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,349
but I think it's more so that people can
training conditions not to worry about

23
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,289
losing mediums

24
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:34,810
and so that's kinda what I'm gonna go
with and so what I'm talking about is I

25
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,170
think

26
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,950
organization should focus on had a
million things out there that can get

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,539
the moon

28
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,239
not ano de an course SF exists but

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,590
when you have glaring own abilities hang
out there than anybody can exploit

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,140
that's kinda the important stuff so fix
the old pics or hanging fruit

31
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,229
I you know generally no idea signatures
exist for aluminium stuff

32
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,750
or they've gotten to the point where
their condition and ignored you know

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,259
oh yeah I know that word as enabled I
need it so the sting or allow that stuff

34
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:08,530
so bottom line don't rely upon scanners
to tell you're going its own

35
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,860
that's a horrible at Penn testers need
to investigate your lows and mediums

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,660
is thoroughly as they do the highs and
in turn your clients need to go ahead

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,980
and do that as well

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,940
and then you keep a human in the mix so

39
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,379
I'm a firm believer the password suck

40
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:32,420
and think we're gonna show that wanna
these almost always works

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,459
anybody ever thereby see those on my
every single parent s wanna is always

42
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:38,549
company 123

43
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,890
yeah now couple people alright

44
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,150
one of those always works for me

45
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,790
yeah I am in that case look expert so

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,650
remembering the password suck DNC with a
password and no password gets you high

47
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,670
where a BNC with the passer to pass
forget you low

48
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,670
right so that carries on to

49
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,439
same thing for SSH Telnet all your data
bases so the fall creds unless you

50
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,939
configure standard actually check for
those two talk Reds

51
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:11,769
don't and therefore see it database open
access

52
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:14,859
or you know the service is listening but
it's not really oh

53
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:19,650
weekly protected service a great week
they're gone scanners to actually check

54
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,650
for common passwords

55
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,319
nobody

56
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,280
not even Dale iraq and so

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,739
so first come thing we talk about admin
interface is a

58
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,959
Chris nickerson is the ninja at taking
an admin interface

59
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,989
and breaking into an army I so now I

60
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,400
after starting working with him I've got
a methodology to finance stuff cuz it's

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,439
always a race to find it before he does

62
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,790
and so apostle methodology for that is
to you

63
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,930
in Mecca range take those results put
him in a medically

64
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,620
because it does the database went inside
and that is where you can actually pull

65
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,279
out all the services into like a

66
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:02,029
a CSP and then you can use ass in Ruby
to make an HTML file

67
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:06,200
and Winky which is a Firefox plugin so
that's in map services

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,230
are you can go through and when she
import everything you can I

69
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,730
actually search reports if you just
wanna see 80 443 you're just wanna see

70
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,919
22 you're just wanna see whatever you
can do that

71
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,880
you can just up for checking your kind
options to actually

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,190
output that stuff so kinda looks like
that so

73
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,520
the poor rains at my blog my website
looks like it scanned all the time

74
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,450
but yes there's a whole bunch a host
there's a whole buncha services

75
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,010
listening

76
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,590
we can take some really neat actually

77
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,780
take this CSV file they get output in

78
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,310
yes if it's 443 you're 80 443 I know
it's an HTTPS link

79
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,180
inside to show up that portent IP import
in there if it's 80 80 80

80
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,420
I'm pretty confident that it's going to
be HTTP

81
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,650
and sell venue that inhibits wanna if
anything out I'll go ahead and give me

82
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,330
an HTTP link in an HTTPS link

83
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,370
answer then when you do that you get
well you slinky

84
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,780
when you do that you get a can have a
HTML file that looks like that

85
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,340
and then there's a a pretty nifty
Firefox plugin called linky

86
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,000
which allows you to you open all the
links in a tab

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,380
San I can open all its for now these
magic interfaces start popping out for

88
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,690
me

89
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,000
useful now

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,740
go to hell alright cool

91
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,620
are so moving on

92
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,440
ColdFusion who's got ColdFusion
Enterprise nobody

93
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,110
and Exide alright well ColdFusion

94
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,300
is awesome for me not so much for
everybody else circle fusion typically

95
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,210
gives you a risk factor at nine

96
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:49,380
and slow there's a lot I stole this from
barricades talk

97
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,810
I so one last time I searched her was
$455 million sites using ColdFusion

98
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,540
so enterprise and there's not a single
person here that uses it you're lucky

99
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,870
on so what's the problem with it

100
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,450
so cross site scripting is abundant a
sequence actions pretty common cause

101
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,680
people fail to do

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,290
the the proper parameterized queries
want to devote its closure path

103
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:13,980
disclosure

104
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,540
professor messages just miss
configurations listener necessarily

105
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,710
you're taking your opponent but you
certainly

106
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,410
useful for their poor more this talk is
to

107
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,420
to bug that came out in the last couple
years you have the lookout reversal

108
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,680
directory traversal exploit and then the
external entity in

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,570
XML injection explain and as the two CDs
for those

110
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,860
and so almost every time I come across

111
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,300
a cold fusion box know it's Boehner will
to one of those things

112
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,860
that's kinda looks like with the locale
traverse so you basically

113
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,800
directory traversal back keep all the
password file for ColdFusion

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,220
and then if you check out the new
citizen link there's a whole thing on

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,710
can burn at the shop on you can
basically just past the action log into

116
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,930
the admin interface with that

117
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,260
from there you can set up schedule jobs
and things to bring coder

118
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,700
a body shell or do whatever you want I'm

119
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,630
inside this one is Ian D injections up
at the top right

120
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,120
I is the path that you wanna Paul it
says is kinda say and you can do the

121
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,610
same thing and pull on the

122
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,140
password hash be the XML injection
vulnerability

123
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,720
and so it's right there but at the XA no
injection vulnerabilities can't count

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,390
because

125
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,290
it will actually do direct real issues
for you and so this guy actually had a

126
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,760
cold fusion patches

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,930
boulder but it wasn't really doing
anything with it

128
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,140
so I thought I was kinda funny and
tripwire

129
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,680
and some other things so so also useful
now you can indirectly licence if you

130
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,720
have a hard time finding the files that
you're looking for CSE

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,130
for some reason it's not an in OC
coffees in a live

132
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,150
password up properties you can actually
start looking for it if it's portable TX

133
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,930
injection

134
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,990
book useful

135
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,520
cool so a problem

136
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,190
tomcat server so

137
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,780
server setting ready come across is
something tests yes was kinda fun

138
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,790
you know we all know that the on/off the
you know

139
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,380
deployer web console the player thing is
cool you know there's a

140
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,120
there's an auto acting a mostly for that
and I don't unfortunate not come across

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,040
that too often at least externally

142
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,360
but when you have service status new
year that full legal strewn you get off

143
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,880
for two things like all the publisher
applications that are on JBoss in Tomcat

144
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,200
urals are easily accessed include
session ID's

145
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,970
so what time he can just take that
string that's right there on the show

146
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,840
that right you're browsing your login

147
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,840
which is handy on then you can find all
the hidden nap so I don't necessarily

148
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,810
have to totally interrogate the apt the
Apple actually

149
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,810
tell me that stuff for me so

150
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,360
this case all the applications that are
on that server on a

151
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,040
i think thats JBoss are published for me
so I know the URL co2

152
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,760
I know slashing slash I Pegasus I know
that JMX consuls deployed at least

153
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,140
on so helps me and then you have all
sorts if you know this is all the GET

154
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,850
request that

155
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,170
things making so had in years manual
poster

156
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:16,170
you authenticate requests I can just
pull those in same thing for tom cat

157
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,810
there basically share the same bones
where I can see

158
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,730
versions and applications that are
deployed in one

159
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,560
so you can also use it to find common
stuff

160
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,860
and so I was gonna do in some slight
doing the pictures for the slide ins

161
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,200
like hell xD what is

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,620
the you command that's weird says okay
let me browse to that and so thankfully

163
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,950
director listings is turned on like okay
that's weird

164
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,690
well who am I had snack n and so

165
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,250
you know that that actually been on
there for quite a while you must step in

166
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,110
that box was from 2007

167
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,570
so it's useful to find olds buying poon
stuff

168
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:00,080
while you're doing other stuff I'm

169
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,700
so I browsable directories

170
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,440
so index I love can be your friend same
thing with when marion software engineer

171
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,090
but you can

172
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,850
sup down the whole website which usually
includes useful stuff

173
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,210
you know but a lot of time you may use
this one a lot like this once

174
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,370
totally a low yeah and

175
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,610
like we've we've completely own people
because

176
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,990
index I was on say can you call stuff
like find you know all the release crawl

177
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,100
the web configs

178
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,630
and everything which is always handy

179
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,420
on web.config so this is going to go
back and take that was there

180
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,910
a chat passwords and

181
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,540
Big Daddy right which also had database
passwords and

182
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,140
this is about two seconds like working
on the way an answer is one

183
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,630
up less antacid enough so we're actually
kinda stuck on those contests and I was

184
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,660
like man

185
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,490
how Mike so he's got someone already
broken and we knew they'd broken and my

186
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,960
how these guys get an answer I found
this

187
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,600
and so the top DB SQL one was a database
backup

188
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,280
and so to their to their credit they
were encrypting all the database

189
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,070
passwords which issued

190
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,200
on but unfortunately Live dot heart was
a backup to the site and so that had the

191
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,540
actual PHP running the site which had to
be creepy function and

192
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,830
and so I was able to take you know three
lines PHP to dis deak ripped all the

193
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,400
your credit card columns that we've had
so II

194
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,870
that was a good win I like that in they
also had other issues because directory

195
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,080
listing was turned on a other logs were
there which had to encrypt the data but

196
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,600
you know these guys had all

197
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,630
all that stuff so that response I got
that one don't get a big success

198
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,890
the government paycheck that day

199
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,500
so resume and we're doing a

200
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,060
SharePoint me as got your point near
prize

201
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,150
II a couple people using SharePoint has
told us live from the minded security

202
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,440
guy cuz it was neat and I couldn't come
up with anything spree

203
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,570
but we see a lot a lot of places use it
I

204
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,370
a lotta places miss configure it

205
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,650
and so its usual for using a user and a
man

206
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,940
im enumeration and a lot of times we'll
see

207
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,070
you know the all all document shared out

208
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,300
which is usually a misconfiguration for
most places

209
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,620
on if you've got of SharePoint

210
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,680
its always useful because there's always
our router configs are alarm code or

211
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,780
something and that's

212
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,090
ask Chris about that if you wanna talk
about that's he's

213
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,950
he's also the ninja phone fine and all
that stuff and so

214
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:46,080
generally that whole like low Microsoft
SharePoint is in the low category and

215
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,440
not have to remember to find and
interrogate at is down to bottom in at

216
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,430
least media nasa stuff

217
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,480
it's gotten it's gotten good stuff you
can find so

218
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,420
finding it plentiful on the web you can
use Google dorks the stack and you guys

219
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,340
have like

220
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,690
a hundred Google dorks define various
SharePoint things

221
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,760
so more so if you're actually looking at
particular clients that are trying to

222
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,840
find somebody disc

223
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,320
randomly they have the SharePoint
hacking biggie project which is my gurl

224
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,400
zina

225
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,450
perl script it's been converted to an
EXE to

226
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,590
run through an just check out the rails
against the IP

227
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,990
pass it or you can roll your own there's
a buzz lists and then you can take my

228
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,490
spleen write a quick oxo remodel to open
that lists in

229
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,810
ripped through the IPOs in any fine
useful stuff

230
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,090
and is having a little mini Necto thing
and I run

231
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,310
answer open access kinda looks like that
where

232
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,440
you just got all the files and groups
and lists and things just kinda hanging

233
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
out there

234
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,610
useful not useful

235
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,440
k useful awesome user name is if it's
this is a

236
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,860
a pretty significant misconfiguration
but if they have misconfigured at you

237
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,880
can actually

238
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,589
you see your ID Eagle 72 you can issues
burn

239
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,449
and is ripped through you no wonder what
a thousand a router big you think the

240
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,839
organization is now you've got

241
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,410
email name I in the top line is
definitely

242
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,790
you know Active Directory credit what
you need to pass to login somewhere

243
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,180
on dance else another example tissue

244
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,040
poor not domains put out the admin

245
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,760
and you can also abuse Assoc also

246
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,760
you need to have a vindication for this
which is arguably hard to come by

247
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,000
the you know but you can pass

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,680
a simple post sober questionnaire this
is basically the cookie need so you can

249
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,790
use burp to set up

250
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,230
of sort of sorry time for you and
basically

251
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,120
you can say hey I want to get all the
eighties Sony get all the A's

252
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,520
for the organization when the my results
2010

253
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,690
the result to that is all the A's in
Active Directory

254
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,920
appear thousand and you can obviously
did

255
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,820
abcd and then pretty soon you have a
giant XML file

256
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,589
full love all the users any enterprise

257
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:16,589
so that's SharePoint 2010 at this one
works on SharePoint 2007 below

258
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,570
basically the same thing you're doing a
SOAP requests and the result is a giant

259
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,730
list if users

260
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,160
things back useful

261
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,410
so want to have that lets users I go
back to password sock

262
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,940
and I go through and tram I know 15-20
passwords and I use every time and

263
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,790
generally going to get one of those

264
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,800
excess usual

265
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,089
call

266
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,780
its so I'm you guys run across

267
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,930
webbed after surgery she put something
tests

268
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,750
when was the last time someone had a CDP
will put work

269
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,890
II I've seen it once in my life

270
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,230
Web data actually on quite a bit if
things work so

271
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,550
on typically wear dad comes back as a a
low

272
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,970
on it's enabled by default I S five so
every time I see it again really really

273
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,060
excited that my cock wrap it I S five
which means just enabled and they

274
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,660
probably didn't mean to enable it

275
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,199
on the game have you know doing where
Dad is at its

276
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,959
almost never writeable at the Weber you
have to actually find

277
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,370
if it is enabled the rival folder so you
taking deer buster in some Ruby

278
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,680
to like go ahead and find ballad folders
and then go back around and try those

279
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,040
with you know your web where dat script
choice

280
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,230
discounted the methodology for going
after that stuff

281
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,350
anybody having people have our own staff
with writeable were def

282
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,680
couple yeah I mean it's

283
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,400
its common enough that I have to make
sure that I remember to check for every

284
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,140
test

285
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,150
but I don't obviously get into it every
test

286
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,300
so that's kinda like wow this is gap
test put out by the scenario guys

287
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,839
basically this you give it the path and
a surge trying to play

288
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,390
various file types an extension types
there's a there's a mess wit module

289
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,350
written by rhineland does

290
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:19,000
something similar on inning as cake what
can I put calling all these succeeded

291
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,540
I'll let me go and see now if the ap
goes hand allows me to

292
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,190
exact those files as a lot and you can
write a text file that night executed

293
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,470
labs you wanna

294
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,540
exec something that's execute PHP JSP

295
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,060
ASP something like that Iron Man NES an
impact or shells in

296
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,360
do anything also please

297
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,750
so they should be put in a sheepy search
stuff usually gets shoved into the

298
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,520
the me allowed methods and you can I
gotta go through one by one and see if

299
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,940
anything is useful

300
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,080
and search like put is

301
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,140
a lot of times in is enabled in the
options but not necessarily enabled and

302
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,290
I as Sir

303
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,590
I athletes and I S only think so not
necessarily enabled and I S and working

304
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,880
but you web skaters better about finding
puts with an early test

305
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,820
cuz you have the same problem up finding
that magic folder that you can actually

306
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,250
put two

307
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,820
I search can be fine if it's in a book
as you get a directory listing

308
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,430
very thing my my body raft alerted a
blog post on that

309
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,660
you can check out later but it looks
something like that is

310
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,070
use and a a valid XML first ballot post
a question

311
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,550
box in your list everything and Weber

312
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,130
that's pretty handy on useful

313
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,220
going to use it later on Pinterest in my
search for that neither

314
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,860
now awesome night CS gas and I'll talk

315
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,870
I'm

316
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,740
problem

317
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,120
a lot II waste so much time on it cites
9 time

318
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,410
it's bad schedule in my secret vector to
my business partner

319
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,520
so who's heard this news is this

320
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,500
and he has got max

321
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,990
I know at least one he better raise your
hands and looking and now you have one

322
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,470
I it's owed this is enabled a lot I
think by defaults on my car crack me I

323
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,900
see a lot on internals

324
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,870
on so I get too low

325
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,420
you know when your skin and stuff its
lowest at

326
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,850
Bowser's so what can you do with it it's
kinda like NFS in SMB

327
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,280
I hear he's attacked by seven runs stuff
that you have read

328
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,090
re access to files and folders for sure
and then sometimes been and how they set

329
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,570
it up you got right access

330
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,260
I'm finding it is in map

331
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,490
has a ton of scripts for looking for
that stuff I looks like that

332
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,980
so you can the server in tony tells you
user name in

333
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,980
you know who the server is I think the
next one has

334
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,850
so here's all the the folders that are
actually shared out so desktop

335
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,680
downloading

336
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,320
on up stuff Dropbox attendee

337
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,500
so

338
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,170
to get a Mac it's like super easy kick
taken after this stuff you basically

339
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,680
just like connected at and it will do it
for you

340
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,910
and I'll have a Mac and poor

341
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,660
so this guy as Gossip Girl season 4

342
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,190
you have some useful stuff keep keep
your Katy Perry

343
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,800
nothing overly sexy there but you know
you get the idea that

344
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,990
you there's a potential for finding
something useful to you

345
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,410
can take continue on with your pen test
with with this

346
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,490
method down you

347
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,660
I caught up on my Gossip Girl after that
contest if you got 1x

348
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,450
I I could find no windows poor Windows
utility to do but we think you got a FPS

349
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,440
in G I which allows you basically missus
all the stuff

350
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,190
and then you can just connect to the you
know the remote host

351
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,900
much like NFS everyone's pretty familiar
with NFS and open in a fisher's

352
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,340
there wasn't a slide in the night to
call us about your most people have

353
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,880
heard that has been around since before
I was born and so on lanix

354
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,330
links lani kinda looks something like
that so the of no user

355
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,370
of that so pretty sure the

356
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,590
if in if in mak- ing give you some
results are things it's it's often

357
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,220
without

358
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,390
a username and password so that I will
know you can't do you need of tact

359
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,500
access to stuff

360
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,210
basically we're often this her Nasser's
box in

361
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,170
Iran and checking out I was downloading
a test

362
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,480
Gandhi your okay

363
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,570
so again you know in download Katy
scariest %uh Fisher on my ex

364
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:49,090
and check out Dropbox another pictures
and stuff

365
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,050
I was all excited cuz need a net sounded
like something useful and it wasn't it

366
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,890
was like pictures of flowers and
butterflies

367
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:01,890
was pretty disappointing about this

368
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,850
who looks for this stray sixty one guy

369
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,010
Haasan it was pretty money on

370
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,830
there's a lot of words up there it
basically is a debug function for ASP

371
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,120
and so just logs everything you do if
you don't wanna read all that cuz it a

372
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,530
lot

373
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,780
apologists so hi

374
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,600
next post will tell you that it's a a
severe Eagle's medium in expose land

375
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,640
nestle and it's a medium down there at
the bottom

376
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,000
and hacking eric says it's a medium as
well

377
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,810
so I think we're sure it's a medium so
what can you do with it

378
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,830
you can read all the variables in data
from HTTP requests

379
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,190
it and it's configurable how many its
doors at the bottom there

380
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,970
post requests are awesome and then
finding it bomb scanners are

381
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,090
pretty good at finding a and Metasploit
has a model for

382
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:07,120
so miss what module looks kinda like
that give their path

383
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,780
you know how you gonna know it's km 40 I
plan on how you define that but the

384
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,490
first one you might be able to find
that's the

385
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:20,490
you know website path entry sixty

386
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,150
that's kinda what it looks like so when
you hit it you've got a

387
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,440
you last 10 requests and then when you
can click on the

388
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,440
view details thing to see what was going
on with it

389
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,730
useful yeah I thought to

390
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,130
muncie I think we busy man on the next
line so

391
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,650
this one actually had creds to the app
in the POST request

392
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:56,650
useful

393
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,370
you know Citrix

394
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,510
and he has got Citrix by Citrix

395
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,790
alright so kinda looks like that you
login

396
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,440
get access these maps Citrix ketzel
onassis

397
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,180
for a it's there secure looks like that
you know if you're if you're

398
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,880
get money to spend you've got
multi-factor off on it and then you can

399
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
log into

400
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,040
the website and see if there's a couple
citrus type B clients or usual you just

401
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,420
log in and play solitaire all day

402
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,000
letter that's a good stuff

403
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,550
might be harder to break out a solitary
in so many other APs that they actually

404
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,670
a plan might be a recommendation

405
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,930
so what you can do with it on

406
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,210
lot on access to publish applications on

407
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,940
escaping from those public's publish
applications which is always fun

408
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,180
on and like lotsa discovery so let's go
through how to find some that stuff

409
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,470
so again in matt has some really fun
scripts for identifying

410
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,320
and so a new rates and as much as a new
marine servers XML

411
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,640
and see through it and I P and it shows
the

412
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,380
various Citrix servers that support that
I P so this place had actually 5 a.m.

413
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:19,100
kinda sporting moment like a
load-balancing Citrix in new maps

414
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,510
actually pulls out all the published
applications at the box is misconfigured

415
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,590
and so this was pretty handy because I
got a whole buncha

416
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,080
like user names right useful

417
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,200
like JR JR M Myers like that's useful

418
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,400
I now have like happened when I need to
log into the app

419
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,120
useful menu that was a reminder that was
there

420
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,340
yeah act that's that's they are

421
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,080
yeah you gotta use that so talk I gave
us rob for Derby Conn we talked about in

422
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,980
maps group in

423
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,890
I'd really highly recommend making use
of those in bringing it into your pen

424
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,090
testing methodology

425
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,820
because the best ones like this don't
actually fire off when it sees

426
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,660
you know 443 open yet to tell it to go
after to look for Citrix stuff

427
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,970
on lots of useful stuff they're so when
you take a bunch a user names in any

428
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,470
remember that password sock

429
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,410
you've probably got a pretty good chance
if getting into one of those

430
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:18,110
also works over 1604 DP

431
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,510
so in this case at any rate it all these
random I don't speak Spanish so that

432
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,950
profits and I speak Spanish probably
mean something but

433
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,250
you get a whole bunch of other apso same
thing

434
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,580
on the UT P science is typically you'll
see this more on the older Citrix

435
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,300
environments

436
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,720
again

437
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,250
enumerate the Citrix server you wanna
come across ICA files

438
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,110
the in many planners and that's how
users get into your price:

439
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:51,260
1 okay as a pretty useful cuz you know
they're basically text files in one sir

440
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,250
associate with the sexes client you can
change the properties insiders text

441
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,270
files to you

442
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,500
to do stuff so you know once you log in
and click it now looks something like

443
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,130
that

444
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,550
but you can also take all the difference
absence Union rated

445
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,290
answer changing your ICA file to
actually start connecting to the

446
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,000
so you know it's one of those gives you
that

447
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,980
you no change in the ICA file gives you
that right useful

448
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,080
you might find some app that's not of
protected or not

449
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,710
a grocery cart it seemed

450
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,710
its and then

451
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,450
I think there's been a lot of talks in
research on escaping from those

452
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,740
applications so

453
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,780
once you're actually logged into those
applications pretty trivial to get out

454
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,340
of them

455
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,910
I did a couple blog posts in: it's been

456
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,260
that's that's kinda been talked about
quite a bit so can command shells can

457
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,920
export IDEX Ian

458
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,040
you know navigate around in the network
neighborhood and see what you can see

459
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,320
from the Citrix server and doing other
things

460
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,520
Ryan I cat is super awesome for that

461
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,990
your body is a yeah it's the bomb for

462
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,190
if you're doing is Ricky are stuffed in
someone's gimme credit to some Michael a

463
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,170
kiosk it will

464
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,570
it'll say on the Linux unlike someone
does and start trying all the various

465
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,080
Linux Windows trickster

466
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,080
to escape out of that its automatic
which is cool

467
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,690
so and I zoomed through slides

468
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,050
so to recap

469
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,240
don't rely on your vulnerability
scanners to find all your important

470
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,870
stuff

471
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,290
I'm you guys eaten any conditions to
have couple

472
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,280
I and yes gonna make sure that we also
focus on we collectively cuz I forget to

473
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,930
do to you

474
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,070
I'll focus on those lows in the ames
invalidate that

475
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,200
they're not to you know I missing
something good

476
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,410
with that's hitting a low and medium
clients in to do it and keep you human

477
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,940
so thats all I got

478
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,270
i guess im open to questions I was easy

479
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:12,270
sure its tail

480
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,710
Africa

481
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,690
all so in general the stuff you
discussed but many the six at the end

482
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,159
how noises and those

483
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,659
scans meter unanimous Matassa for the
XML want that's

484
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:40,380
up one post request I think the hardest
part of that one is actually parsing XML

485
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,789
comes back as when you get a called
giant lot of XML like

486
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:50,630
from from that's a lot of info that came
back

487
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,750
that a single post request that's all
the ups in

488
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,210
I and at it's a similar query

489
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,159
I for the UT piece i the house to so I
don't think very noisy

490
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,549
any idea sailors could let me

491
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:09,970
correctly please like to know if it's
like San of Lake

492
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,980
fiery eight after me when I do that I
think we've seen a lot and I have a name

493
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,940
and no one ever since

494
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,500
seen us doing it anything else

495
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,419
it I'll advise bringing at

496
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,480
and I had they don't ever put at the
beginning like

497
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,789
I don't necessarily think these
vulnerabilities are mislabeled I think

498
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:34,549
for the most part they're correctly
labeled as Lausanne mediums

499
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:38,179
I think it's just important to realize
that you can

500
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:41,710
abuse those in certain situations so
much I had

501
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,450
quick question arm

502
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,830
was make sense to try to brute force
obligation I these

503
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,320
to find known published on some

504
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,320
I am a or try to at least the

505
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,080
somehow discover I'm not by brute
forcing but kinda brought forth but that

506
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,130
okay so to my knowledge on

507
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,899
it has to be allow

508
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:14,700
to be credible if it's allowed to be
crippled and it will just give you that

509
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,590
information

510
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,240
and so there was and I don't think you
could actually in america someone can

511
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,289
correct me if I'm wrong

512
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,270
that make sense like they have to enable
the discovery of that stuff

513
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,320
and if they've enabled it you could like
pass for gas against it

514
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,380
or application guess against it but I
think

515
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,370
if they've enabled it then it would just
be turned on and we just give you that

516
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,500
information if you asked for she's gave
it the right

517
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,590
request there's one on the front to

518
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,789
or did I answer it is coming

519
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:48,909
appreciate asking questions so I did and
like super super early

520
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,149
can you go back to the last chair point
slide yeah

521
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:57,700
I think in one slide you mentioned that

522
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,740
you need to be authorized for the
enumeration

523
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,179
and the status yeah here

524
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:07,909
use it to cook in the next slide yep
don't see the Cougars I mean

525
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:11,490
unity you don't have to be author
nineteen are I you need offered at

526
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,860
for yeah on sided ember

527
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,440
and burps can I can do in a XO in the
burbs tabby can say do of

528
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,000
for me and it's kinda magically doing
that and

529
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,179
I think the cookie it comes back as you

530
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,159
least on this app that we're testing the

531
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,260
the cookie was in the at least a right
and they would

532
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,399
the cookie the cookie diet the top said
like authenticating it like a 60 minute

533
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:38,380
when there's something

534
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,870
and that was in the response Sep so yes
it does require authentication

535
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,299
okay yeah I couldn't I think all the
SOAP calls

536
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,309
require off to my knowledge

537
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:54,309
for that kinda stuff okay

538
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:57,730
so it so that's good I mean that's
that's correct behavior right so now

539
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,610
you're just on

540
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,179
you know did you know HR HR get me into
the app

541
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:05,470
rhyme in an ounce

542
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,500
thanks for coming

543
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,039
so I got
