1
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,620
eg with morning everyone

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,850
there my name is Andre my personal

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,890
Inc making printers ten years down the
road

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,800
well I'm glad to be here

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,990
now let's turn and at this conference
were nice so

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,690
let's get rolling so first who was about
myself

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,129
if you II am generally interested in the
security the

8
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:39,260
RFID the few played with my for classic

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,610
you must have probably youth out faulk
which is my pic logic an official give

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,720
Sherrod and then I'm off to

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,220
to printers I am okay small disclaimer

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,309
well with here too just make sure but

13
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,150
my own views than come whatever you do
with

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,239
whatever is planned he is your own risk
or your own

15
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,530
breaks him printers okay so

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,700
does with services that gender which
will go through will

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,320
will see some bit over his three
imprisoned about the

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,299
I making printers well we'll be taking a
motivation yall

19
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:20,330
with someone the 12 take printers

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,850
I am will fancy the market profile what
is there to be back down

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,969
what are the revenues and then we'll
will go to

22
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:32,619
I wanna wear like revenues and picnics
on

23
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,979
taking printers and then we'll course I

24
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,630
are open up with some some summary some

25
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,670
solution possible solution on questions
okay so

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,039
is doctor our own 2002 at least publicly

27
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,320
but with those public researchers done
by family

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,750
about FedEx basically disclosed some

29
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,820
a job on the route is a which are still
there like 10 years on the road

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,200
and the because it's become particle

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,899
vulnerabilities well but they if their
search was mainly

32
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,960
the done on HP printers on though

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,290
well a lot of tools on a
proof-of-concept presented them

34
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,560
though was another article by someone on
the most of it from

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,710
I also had discussed like um you know
bro there are

36
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,800
percent I'll the

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,980
vulnerabilities in their printers like
call their

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,530
being program all how they work whether
about

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,130
the article always mainly a.m. that
hiking

40
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,740
cartridges okay and basically

41
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,400
where ready every time this article was

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,950
just do it quite cut it is but anyway
it's a with everything from

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,660
so-called into them missed you say the
OK key printers

44
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,200
somehow went down and then it appeared
in 2006 by ironic

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,560
apparently put keep without what though
come that some

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,560
up why well

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,800
page the discussing there is a specks of
security of

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,560
printers at it covered like before
passports

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,480
film at SNMP FTP HTTP and whenever

50
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,630
things which you usually are better in a
printer which you

51
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,820
might not think about this right so been

52
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,430
basically it here so put put put a lot
of light

53
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,040
on their both aspects of our printer
which should

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,150
think is just printing paper has much
more inside

55
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,360
them again four years

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,670
it goes into the shadow I'm again after
four years

57
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,540
this topic appear like in 2010 when I
started their search

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,160
I and some up the guys from France

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,600
presenter some topical I am picking

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,100
and reverse-engineering you know where
from Lexmark printers

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,350
basically if the song Lexmark's are

62
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,280
I linux-based operating systems and

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,570
medical officials note that about how to
find I

64
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,720
a string and buffer overflows gonna
build is in other

65
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,500
one of them all those I am them

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,900
in 2011 two guys from US to start them

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,570
completely different approaches to print
up making

68
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,009
basically one of them has been a long
while

69
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:26,930
well which basically it tries to abuse
soaring

70
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,090
sorry that price thought to abuse the AM

71
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,920
BDL specification I'll go about the jail
and all their

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,400
their knowledge a little bit later
basically it tries to do the

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,680
include that this to be the file system
over publicly accessible

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,950
bring those or privately accessible
Panthers basically what it does

75
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,250
printers have their own filesystem the
IOC's

76
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,530
accessible for Joe basically all that
does is

77
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,280
take your file and then spread to the
printers right and encrypt it

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,290
so you can store your confident
information on

79
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,600
there is better as a man who resembled
back and best believe has like

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,710
some tools like brink FS is the core
model

81
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,660
because like bring the bus come there
and so on let's take a look at the

82
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,220
interesting

83
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,720
them

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,790
a a completely different

85
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,980
I think no that they can buy peace

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,840
I'll the and I basically a

87
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,920
price put together a clip the with her
which tries to carve is the information

88
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,630
stored on the printer because for
example Panthers

89
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,240
a a lot of them have cooperation for
Pope re

90
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,860
the emails L LDAP

91
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,100
press towards and so on and so on and
they're basically it has belonged there

92
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,139
admin interface

93
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,830
and water them are stored in cleartext
so basically with Miss

94
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,090
the book it does when is it identifies
their model

95
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,130
just fire bear both Pacific to it goes
grabs

96
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,870
the the pages bosses and it gives the
best for so come

97
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,160
basically is like first step of
penetrating the network because

98
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,800
you want LDAP bus was 40 the mana so on

99
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,170
and sometimes for free but sports like
who

100
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,389
much user pass for that's what I saw on

101
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,630
like their instinct implications of
thirst they just like

102
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:19,790
on printers

103
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,600
okay so Miss Cleo why would the
motivation

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,690
but I'm picking printers now why would

105
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,610
someone pic Brendan medley event is but
when you have a break the right view

106
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,900
most people don't think its it it's
about the only like

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,940
a piece of a equipment but which

108
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,910
bring some sheet of paper right but it
like a full-blown computer on even more

109
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,760
because

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,530
it usually has the like there is

111
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,889
a proprietary or number by three another
extension but

112
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,740
in the same time is like a full board
with IOM

113
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,350
more or less conventional I'll on that
they're like power pc's

114
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,200
the arms and so on and so on it has the
nethercutt says

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,810
it has memory it has parties because
they were from a significant its

116
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,490
computer

117
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,830
which you you can play with some even
run

118
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,120
the Obama shan's and all kinds of weird
softer which is there

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,850
from late eight years I think

120
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,180
like when the the printers a in this is
the

121
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,910
developing pics this then there's like
the GOP's Hill postscript

122
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,270
and so on and so on

123
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,590
so nowadays they they keep evolving be

124
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,940
made of exhibit security problems but we
keep involving

125
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,240
ending and newt new stuff was new
technology comes out

126
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,410
they add new stuff to the printers like
a swipe cards RFID cards

127
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,199
fingerprints held up boss wars and so on
basically

128
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,300
user very interesting good security home

129
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,540
details which for example harvesting
them with

130
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,000
will give you like a lot of a
information as that

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
after an attack on printer and given
their printers are

132
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,940
all 0 usually overlook from security
perspective on

133
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,500
security assessment and penetrations yes
okay

134
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,110
not leave is not the Pooh to be them but

135
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,479
in journal speaking so it's a very good
with an easy target

136
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:22,479
to get everything in one package week no
Knollwood arkansan

137
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,100
him so another example be for example if
ever

138
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,190
the into espionage or whatever or and a
banker is

139
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,839
into is benazzo why taking the trouble
of

140
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,839
well bypassing several but network

141
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,479
for security 30 with urs a.m. accessing
to include the

142
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,810
file system one somebody's computer
trying to get the

143
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,420
included file the cricket when you for
example can

144
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,709
mahler a printer and occasionally
documents even confidential they get

145
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:52,579
from the right

146
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:56,069
so one but printer

147
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,470
the plant is being sent to the printer
taking it from a printer the elected

148
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,279
directly

149
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,449
on created plan takes like its you

150
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,509
you avoid the lot of red flags and a lot
of trouble

151
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,999
does byee going to the to that to the
right target right to you

152
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:14,860
avoid everything and it's not

153
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,170
thanks because eventual at the end of
the day like even

154
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,649
being created doc man Steven the ones
which use

155
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:25,399
secure extensions and are being created
over the wire

156
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,709
were so they cannot be sniffed we've
Wireshark at the end of the day they get

157
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:29,350
the group that

158
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,649
your printer right to be bring the so

159
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:36,410
you get everything on his body you would
like several

160
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,230
levels of encryption and protection does
play

161
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:47,230
putting your yourself in the right place
in the printer

162
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:52,869
okay so

163
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:56,930
a number motivation is is not know

164
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,170
there was not so much information
publicly available

165
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,129
and they're still not so so much
information available regarding

166
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:08,439
printers or well protocols

167
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:12,970
and moreover for for proprietary or
private political

168
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,149
so for example if if you try to

169
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,899
to search for biz keywords: which year
basically appear very often

170
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,869
in their printer fair-weather you'll
find not so many results

171
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:27,529
for example you find six results
Missouri result I result

172
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,369
and all these the Commons are brought by
the Commons over VP Joe

173
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:36,110
political must be there used to a grid

174
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,199
the him I want to control go in more
details later

175
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,889
in Comber them for example the PDF
laypeople

176
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:47,980
thought the searching for this but if
launch

177
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,480
and the Dr Stephen that so on but you
find a lover's also

178
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,860
mean for their is very high and in in
some degree a lot of

179
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,100
woes security issues not the other day
%uh the rest

180
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,600
or are being addressed or their issues
are being raised already

181
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,639
however for the printers the visibility
is still there though

182
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,660
okay so what what we're talking about
here is like the printer market that

183
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,619
somebody was a

184
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,990
gave is not so many printer but I love
it is worth it

185
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,889
okay for think about the a user-level
where he has like a cheap

186
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:25,550
the my printer a 450 hero you're not
very interested in his pornography

187
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,089
he prints right but if you are thinking
about like big or transitional

188
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,009
government

189
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:33,809
or I enterprises or multinationals

190
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,619
or a murderous other big organization

191
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:40,709
they have like fleets fleets of printers
like

192
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:44,009
falls in love em hundreds they're being
managed through

193
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:47,290
I'll flee the ministration leg a special

194
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,730
Sato which help them minor the printer
because it's not like a piece of laptop

195
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,759
you can carry

196
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,970
its very your very heavy so basically im

197
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,569
bed is there a lot of bring those out
there

198
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:05,300
and where we are talking about like
production of 24 million per year

199
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,449
of why I would say perfectly exploitable

200
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,029
and easy targets in and the

201
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,509
Vadis at you you get a lot of them

202
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:19,550
out there okay vanderbur mythic speak up

203
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,230
the problem is have a rocket picture and
operating system

204
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,739
and they are hardware and so on is very
fragmented so

205
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:30,119
with this was like the

206
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:33,420
in in a complication the exploit the
build of them but

207
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,989
medis bed Vestil a chance to you or you
might

208
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:42,069
I own on organization because you live a
goal for uniform vendors

209
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:45,540
so if you own like HP printers you know
but

210
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,779
a given organization have like 200 HP

211
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,709
and hold multifunctional you you on them
alright

212
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,819
the medically some all

213
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:01,079
quit misuse and I was like the mile
where a post or jus

214
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,709
an example here you so the

215
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,230
I'll print the FS talkin II

216
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,110
talkable I'll you you you have like
unclean a bill common control because

217
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,800
that is worth both printers are not
being there are often based or

218
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,129
their pitches are not they will finish
with okay I have a vendor they're not

219
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:21,889
really 600

220
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,989
on the benches have because they don't
know how or don't want to thank them

221
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:29,569
the on and that is the

222
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:33,110
basically I'll better

223
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,309
they're not being very well managed from
it's a good perspective

224
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,259
and so you can go pro cut corporate
enterprise and chill

225
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,989
intelligence a said that the fifth or
the whisper mouse or

226
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,649
the okay ago whatever this tomorrow

227
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:50,670
I'll you know you might want to think
this it was his

228
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,839
permanently does it like brick it and
the

229
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,600
you archie achieve on the a a few of the

230
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,269
a or to provide that what you put the
achieved if you

231
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:04,559
when a with most of his get the pics

232
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,970
but its simpler to permanently does it
so

233
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,230
I'll raise no fun in it

234
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,629
okay another idea which the from

235
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,809
I I am I wanted the present is

236
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:23,019
their ok ive from another perspective is
like

237
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,290
Joe location over a mouthpiece what is
that the kind it

238
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,549
is your liver Emma he is in love
organizations

239
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:34,029
aren't like very very

240
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:37,339
I am non movable assets like visit

241
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:40,660
somewhere embrace it very well right
have because

242
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,929
weaver it's very hard to to move 100
kill or two can't kill

243
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:48,549
vendors ok but they overpay here and
there so

244
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,239
I have introduced some minor some
specific for the calls or

245
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:55,489
expressions like Microsoft printer
location tracking

246
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:59,199
inactive the them Active Directory

247
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,100
or their different their different fare

248
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,629
in further a brother calls or
specification like Dennis lock which

249
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:07,790
another used

250
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,459
I am their annual scheme by a

251
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:16,639
the low by eight ish ATF I am bed is

252
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,429
given what you have access to the data
out the location they thought the

253
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,290
printers

254
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,619
is like you you can very well no way or
Muller is

255
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:30,399
at the given point price so I you can
see if their printers as

256
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,529
good reference points geographically so
for W

257
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,360
when you somebody would spreads the

258
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,529
mall where I one IP address space

259
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,689
he doesn't know where he physically is
but a

260
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:48,160
sometimes you want to restrict or you
want to know where your Mike Muller

261
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,929
physically is

262
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:52,420
right up for various reasons so printers
a

263
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,290
very good indication where approximately
you up so just an example

264
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,029
is to were based on Microsoft

265
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,549
up bring her location tracking the for
the well

266
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:06,809
on be the definition for now they have
an example

267
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:10,329
where they show how how to set up what
were your appeal teen

268
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:13,829
ample time to give Victoria thirst for
north east corner

269
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:17,019
and for example in is you don't know

270
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,239
what is Victoria Milano second floor but
that is

271
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:23,660
for example air a computer Bismol were
in

272
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,670
did getting access to is why use a PC

273
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,199
like can do the a simple search

274
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,639
and basically they get the exact other s

275
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,519
and their days like you know where your
mulberries

276
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,999
right a but what's the

277
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:47,879
an interesting idea which might be
exploited

278
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,279
and you'll be surprised basically home
annual

279
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,769
these things like our on the Internet
and

280
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,970
you see they have like red beans of his

281
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,199
receptionist office so the army %uh

282
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,959
ministration building %uh so-and-so also
you you know wake think you are

283
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,000
and you'll be surprised if I show you
missus like

284
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,569
in termination I'll Fermi National

285
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,439
the up on the cover laboratory right

286
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,709
this is from them for some security
laboratory

287
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,010
some educational again and

288
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,889
okay this is from sir okay so

289
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:32,840
basically the you you get some some
point

290
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,409
and thought some some of that means that
they're even put

291
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:40,200
yes of Intermezzo you exactly know where
the printer flowers

292
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,740
so you don't have to do the job I know
exactly

293
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,269
where what kind of printer is there

294
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,330
okay so I've I've taken some

295
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,830
publicly available Google dork some some
other certain engines

296
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,919
results a title put them on the map

297
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,580
and in as you can see for example

298
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,740
is like a big number of

299
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,380
at these what they found publicly
available printers on the internet right

300
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,289
and you'll be surprised all my nan

301
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,779
are there is Lake

302
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:21,860
at some point Google your just come up
handle it right

303
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,919
so and you have everything from

304
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,990
the feel where levels and so on and so
on

305
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,529
so you get my point

306
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,860
so okay this Mysore x4 very
well-developed infrastructure companies

307
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,919
because if a goal for example to rush or
siberia biz

308
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,260
not so many things on the map but for
them for taiwan

309
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,250
for Japan US Europe is like for them

310
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,049
I saw you you have everything here amp
is like

311
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,049
big scary number of publicly available
printers and some of them are very

312
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,070
expensive

313
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,899
and some other them are very exploitable

314
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:08,409
so okay you

315
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,529
okay YouTube you get the point there

316
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:17,850
everywhere basically

317
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,330
okay now but to the printer jobs that is

318
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,929
for example they'll many many ministers
in like

319
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,970
I'll menaces ish about printers

320
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,039
a you can go looking of everybody came
with his own

321
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,559
with his own every vendor came with his
own a.m.

322
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,340
language for for example how to render
on how to receive

323
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,130
the stream of data how to print so but
there are a couple of

324
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,700
for the well as that was possible some
specifications

325
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,500
I'll which is you yell basically one

326
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,429
use and the printer job the to to a
printer when it sends

327
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,809
basically puts peaceful is like a small
Heather buko

328
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:03,899
is called universal exit language in
swung that one common language basically

329
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:04,510
it's

330
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,250
days get shorter X followed by this made
extreme

331
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,059
I'm this means but a new job is
following

332
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,529
in Mitchell specification so whenever
you want to start the new

333
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,059
a.m. be jail Kaman

334
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,200
basically you have to the use this year
in

335
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,899
video is printer job language is the low
by HP

336
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,769
and basically it controls their job
separation

337
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:33,399
you've Iron Man about the through the
back device abandon them

338
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,029
file system commands which on the most
that they them there's also

339
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,299
printer management languages like age
more HP proprietor

340
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,190
a language it's used to a query SNMP
values

341
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,919
over their in printing stream

342
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,309
okay so for example if you have a USB or
effort to connect the printer

343
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:57,809
and I where you've got mister Disable
Bit

344
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:01,500
SNMP you can use that p.m. I'll so with
Luke read the print job

345
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,710
which will the actually get those below
for you

346
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,509
which also or something there's also
postscript which you know

347
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,990
well by language to describe graphic
things

348
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,269
in there's also PPD is like

349
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,799
an extension to eat yes miss you too

350
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,990
make easier for the look on the Panthers
began with PPD files

351
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,019
which you was busy if I E whole earth

352
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,250
how bender specified how specific
printer

353
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,909
or what are the specific postscript
operations but printers

354
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:37,120
or so it's the is that the right drivers
for

355
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,299
will bear big mall multitude original

356
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,139
bring those in is also this sale but but
the post with antibodies are

357
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:48,269
Adobe's at their action in the printing
and

358
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:51,769
BC LNG it is is the conquer alternatives

359
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,330
the developed by page be so but why you
leave have

360
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,669
but drivers you have like PCL or PS
imbera

361
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:01,700
the suffix or usually on the PS so

362
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,340
go on without from anything is a
PCR-based

363
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,700
and go on with PS laying in the diver
manual it's both groups

364
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,659
so what it means but the driver was your
biggest you are installing

365
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:17,210
will be creating if ur poor scream

366
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,429
possibly per month or this he'll come
ons

367
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,570
witchy it will in bed into a.m. be chill

368
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,320
well roping when and sent to the printer

369
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,299
late why is this all because some
printers support on the bus keeps up

370
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,970
something to spot on a bit still in some
printers sport both

371
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,840
will get that is about the gel the lake

372
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,059
gonna build this myth it doesn't have

373
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:46,880
the built-in encryption it doesn't have
a crucial also everything is

374
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,340
percent in cleartext and usually the

375
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,799
any anything which is a good thing later
I event or

376
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,230
takes a initiative and implement their
own

377
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,970
in college people or office cation and
so on and so on which

378
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,480
you see if their old for trouble and is
not very good

379
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,870
on security perspective so for example

380
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:13,039
you can secure a a job for example II
joe says but you can secure a job

381
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,769
her not to be able to picked up by
anyone on the brink they're so

382
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:21,690
you can set the PM one print think

383
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,919
and one but job goes to over printer
which has a key both

384
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,669
it will not print the job until you
enter the correct

385
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:32,809
the end goal but first think is

386
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:35,889
cleartext you can skip it second

387
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:39,539
if you cannot see fit you can like brute
force its

388
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,850
only downfalls in combination right

389
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,490
so again miss not real security is like
security in

390
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,860
a diesel okay

391
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,580
now well what they call the PGO alright
is like

392
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,870
at a demonstration of how everybody
tries to

393
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,669
I'll Scholl there own glory

394
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,570
every vendor tried to show their own
glory in p.geo programming

395
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,940
so they come up we have there is
non-standard

396
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,230
turkey wars which are basically an
indication value

397
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,340
but a lot of obscure and I secure things
Eva printers in

398
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,259
am I'll bizarre the basic for example
operate come on it's from HP

399
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,220
its it follows binary as a file or

400
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,509
whatever provider form up of I feel
where upgrade right

401
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,730
in other not very secure an

402
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,379
Lexmark like programming Bay engine

403
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:41,580
or author image processor

404
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,789
but these ones are access think we're
reading for all right thing

405
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:49,669
the what specific you have proper
printers in their

406
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:53,460
pics others right well so you can

407
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,740
go directly to their other physical
address space or but specific printer

408
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,049
for print job doesn't miss song

409
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,049
interesting by you send the print job
for printer and cope

410
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,409
in now vez also love

411
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:12,370
over well secured like super user
password superuser all

412
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,669
a shutdown printer config brother few
know where Futenma ready filler check

413
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,679
in and so on and so on

414
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,809
I you can do the box by status while
askance and so on

415
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:30,200
well and all visa non-standard them it's
wrote for trouble again if you

416
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,210
start dissecting the feelers will see a
lot of these and

417
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,450
is our only the people that because if
you start following

418
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,320
well love this section in a film where
you'll see a lot of other cleartext

419
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,149
things or the the boxing world and so on
which gives you an indication of

420
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:49,940
with Lidstrom okay

421
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,519
some other things wake Fox models we

422
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,519
the very interesting

423
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,070
so now shop show shown the

424
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,179
theoretical part like now

425
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,559
ok I'll to actually get through to to
the printers &

426
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,799
how to length but the job printer job or
call to crafted

427
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,990
so you can actually do something with
the printer would

428
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,009
different phone printing a document
right missus

429
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:21,370
alt what interests is utmost do
something with the printer so with their

430
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,269
former nixon

431
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:25,590
which is non-printing action and usually

432
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,649
we want it to be malicious because

433
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:33,159
if we 12 title protect ourselves

434
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,990
and the deck both kinds of streams
coming in right

435
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,509
so medically the hell to approaches

436
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:45,980
the some we have remote initiate the
printing

437
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,809
local initiate the printing the
differences

438
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,330
some other printing is being they
initiated by a remote part is like come

439
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,590
up with or a page

440
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,299
and local initially the printer the is
like their printing is

441
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:03,570
in shape on local machine by the local
user consciously or unconsciously

442
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,029
right and fuel few others

443
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:10,759
in details which only show way that
people

444
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,389
so the brink I call it the brink lol
exploit

445
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,779
is the Java a double up let's have

446
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:20,779
printing functionality built in so you
can

447
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:24,399
brindisi are from Java and basically it
gives you

448
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,409
surprisingly access to for to form I
think they're

449
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,370
print job the way you want basically

450
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,789
you are like you you can write your own
kind of

451
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,809
the print do

452
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,169
printer driver in Java right because
printer driver is what

453
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:45,850
what a orbital with a cup a given

454
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,269
want to see what but to get
specification in there

455
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:53,200
editor right and the driver makes for
you

456
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,980
Bearpaw script or basile stream which is
set to be a printer and print their

457
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,850
understand it in im II you can specify

458
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,679
every bits a bit stream and this is very
interesting because you can crop

459
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,519
very interesting beckett's or very
interesting bring jobs in

460
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,899
at very very basic level

461
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:19,279
so I'll show you with them home

462
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,759
the pic can we hook on it with all the
questions the VM

463
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,970
because I want to go to finalize the
condom Banwell all the questions

464
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:34,200
okay

465
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,309
well

466
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:42,700
okay I'll would this be the little bit
up

467
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,970
and I'll be explained so we have the
target the

468
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,450
everybody is able to see this we have a
target

469
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,419
live its AP its allies are champ no
secretaries

470
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:58,210
we have the same IP it seem ready status
we are in bad man in the face

471
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,090
it doesn't matter foster be so
administrator of

472
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,860
bear web interface on the printer bed is
bad for the user

473
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,070
doesn't have to be an administrative to
bring the job right so

474
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,769
sorta been something of a pin the and
will be bring our stuff on there

475
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,840
print their job the stream level

476
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,039
now that the web admin interface so we
are predefined we don't have any

477
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,389
Super Admin right on the printer me

478
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,440
this one is just too show you the result

479
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,570
you okay

480
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,019
so

481
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:39,210
the devices is ready we have the right
there P

482
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,409
okay and that is

483
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:52,409
okay we will be checking a printer

484
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,029
missus the name of our printer doesn't
matter we're gonna

485
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:00,049
yeah so basically you can see missus

486
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,929
this this was a postscript bays

487
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:08,450
the I'll driver in use: over PS in with
Roman I'm

488
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,629
and it's a ever met based printer

489
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:14,840
because the port is specified this IP
address

490
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,070
so basically what means is we're paying
jobs are sent over their IP over effort

491
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,740
into the printer

492
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,740
not over the USB cable

493
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,090
and the effin 9100 is the usual the

494
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,460
I'll it's called the are all overall HP

495
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,639
or HP role or a different naming
conventions

496
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:37,249
for his book is basically the the fourth
wave connect with ample stream

497
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:40,590
job if you have gone up connection but
because we are like

498
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,669
similar thing about other car which is
over doesn't have that them up

499
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:48,220
connection otherwise you put the my boo
more things

500
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,629
ASO missus the port where

501
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:54,710
all the jobs are being sent by this
small little

502
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,879
icon which appears in this is Ray
usually when you print something is like

503
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:00,490
to live like on which pops up

504
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:07,490
home okay so

505
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,420
okay I'll be showing your bed

506
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,210
the we were going to

507
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,620
filesystem that ICT released on the
printer

508
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,770
I'm using telnet to show you but the
bays

509
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,700
no filed before the exploit so basically
this is the directory least go to double

510
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,800
dog postscript

511
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,190
directory PGL directory mister where
usually

512
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:37,920
the phone store data is being stored by
the printer

513
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,630
when it received free for possible Egypt
well

514
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,890
some save divides them web server

515
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,300
pretty easy there back to restructure

516
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:55,300
K

517
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,650
so

518
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,570
way

519
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,920
them now some late but a

520
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,350
missus my year my IP it I'm leading

521
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,450
bed be used to receive the link to a
malicious site

522
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,520
and he is then up lip okay and the

523
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,940
you can you about Michael can use any
social engineering skills

524
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,140
to make you open and pretty in pink
Bethpage or

525
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,650
but public right you can say it's a free
coupon it's the old parks

526
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,340
whatever your soul vicuna load what kind
of the comments people receive

527
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,180
the home looking very Valley then they
really good

528
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,670
the same social engineering skills could
be applied here am

529
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,360
bizarre comes on hugh he he once or if
he is

530
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,810
forced to to print basically

531
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,090
now a security warning appears that

532
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,470
accessed where on Apple has a

533
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:59,220
a request access to a printer usually if
the user is expected to print something

534
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,650
this popup will not raise too much to my
suspicion usually because

535
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,410
you pressed print right is not but it
popped up from

536
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,970
from the sky soloist like big actions
are

537
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,610
correlated so no no bigs suspicion over
here and

538
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,010
I'm not sure if everybody is able to see
if he is like

539
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,710
the small printing icon it means but %uh
public access through

540
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,170
the brink of his time on the sample
stream to the printer

541
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,490
you okay

542
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:37,490
you been

543
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,920
okay we're doing come up again and we

544
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,060
Iran miss a.m. the same Kaman

545
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,740
journalist and you see but and you file
appears here

546
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,480
right so their best 3m I

547
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,530
my this goal saw it wrote the file to be
internal file system or the printer

548
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:05,530
okay

549
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,230
and I'll it did a full scan because I
want to speed it up but

550
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,810
okay well you see the contents of this
screen is like

551
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,120
be jail a filesystem uploaded means you

552
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,360
you are pulled from the printer to the
to the

553
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:31,360
endpoint okay so so we get we have file
uploaded

554
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,810
now who we can now

555
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,930
do a

556
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,610
print printer to spare change so
basically printers have

557
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:46,500
small LCD right it has a smaller city
and they're usually its place a message

558
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:46,830
like

559
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,070
here to play Scottish or printer is
printing or printer is that the printer

560
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,390
is sleeping and so on so on

561
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,740
a new to leave their web interface Lake
replicates a message here so

562
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,760
we can gender but the the vet display it
was he was like a prank few years back

563
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,230
in 2006 after I wronged idk stock but
the

564
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,490
you come the use it as a set lol by
kokanee

565
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,490
can use it as their social engineering
step like

566
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,960
you goto to I web page it changes

567
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,960
up with changes bear message on their

568
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,810
printer call this number for well Orjan
support

569
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,000
issue he calls on them the second the
pics of social engineering take place

570
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,430
like

571
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,770
asking for passport and so on its
alright so you

572
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,880
basically a follow it seems

573
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,230
and not very sophisticated this feature

574
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,630
it can be abused in very malicious way
if properly

575
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,110
social engineering orcas being done on
the personal

576
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:47,350
a around the Pingdom okay so

577
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,530
the user Prince no we have

578
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,250
okay and now

579
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,560
if we refresh his screen with you back

580
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,780
Ltd message it got changed so

581
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,070
again you can put the number available
e-mail email the press or two V's

582
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,820
whatever is like guys billing info
imagination

583
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,930
okay

584
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,410
am our printer still alive so the last
the think is

585
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,410
min will be in resenting the printer

586
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,540
am there is setting in the orderly
manner

587
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,550
mean Inc not not crashing get by sending

588
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,710
the an exploit single or so on bed is a
bed

589
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,930
Thursday it is important for the if we
if you're due for film where r bread

590
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,820
with malicious

591
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,380
by the reason cited you needs to or
start a bitter

592
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,620
orderly so but there you know where

593
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,720
is being properly update to the right so
this reset commander very precious

594
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,740
because you want to remotely reset
usually means are not being recess of

595
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,040
fun

596
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,360
they said they're there I am sleep mode
their connect all the time

597
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,020
but very they're not being reset too
often so it's a very

598
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,140
useful Kaman there to to reset the
printer

599
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,440
will not not Christian resetting

600
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,540
because christendom so easy but

601
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,540
we will send the specific the job

602
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,490
bring jobs and instead of printing
briskly our printer is not printing

603
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,340
anything

604
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,630
when when the user praise from droplet
you can

605
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,830
insert the but valid looking document as
well

606
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,300
not to raise suspicions but not nothing
got printed but bed is but

607
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,530
is not necessary to print something
we've been thrilled to be able to

608
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,330
accomplish this task

609
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:39,980
okay so you see the the printer went off
I it's restarting and so on

610
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,140
so missus 1 this is for

611
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,840
remote remote initiate the printing and

612
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,100
okay with her 15 minutes left the

613
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,880
on I'll okay that is

614
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,620
missus missus well what is called the

615
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,510
PML printer management language is
basically some Kaman's

616
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,550
there from we're working on HP printers
it's using

617
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,790
be Joe at it as its transport

618
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,920
and what its it is it's like

619
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,570
it could have a lentil vs SNMP so even
if that means that the disabled SNMP on

620
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,560
the network

621
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,710
the think you can accomplish the same
action about

622
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,710
accomplished by sending this thing so
its 04 it's very wealthiest by then that

623
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,800
the condition

624
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,050
is therefore is a set up the value the

625
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:38,050
object ideas and so on and so on so
again you can overcome

626
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,420
now lowell local ensure the brink
exploit is like

627
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,420
I'll you send somebody a specially
crafted

628
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,370
or the document and I am

629
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,760
one Baylor princip well he he also

630
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,900
it gets both sections executed on

631
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,830
on their their printer so

632
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,830
vet their actions of from

633
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,040
this them all is are the same

634
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,270
meaning businessman the

635
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,680
base file upload bays the

636
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,900
healthy the change and is there also
there

637
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,520
are reset but there are accomplished by

638
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,120
print think specific pages in as

639
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,640
the Special Cup the doc Mindanao so hot
how to do this document

640
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,630
medically I'm I'm doing the same deal is
to show

641
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,140
there is no no file

642
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,270
steve is like no because I claimed the
file

643
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,760
and I am taking from there fresh
approach in

644
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,890
okay you

645
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,640
now we have like especially got the
document free pages

646
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,360
printing page 1 will upload the file
printing page 2 will change bear

647
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,570
a string on the printer printing page
free

648
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,750
will there is said the printer if you're
paying the entire document

649
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,210
it will lead to all this reactions in
one go but

650
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,790
I'm printing one page at the time to to
demonstrate

651
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,210
actions of each page is no

652
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,440
Visual Basic mate micros involved with

653
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,860
on the specific things used for his

654
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:29,680
so UCI print on the page 1

655
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,370
okay and I do the same

656
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,840
I do the same day at least from FSD
released

657
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,050
I'm and receive it

658
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,300
the file appeared at the over there
right so it's the same

659
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,440
result accomplished in in different way

660
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,000
I'll not the goal for the page 2 MP is
doing the same because I want to present

661
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,310
something something else

662
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,790
I'll just show you call to

663
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,510
to do voz documents okay so

664
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,510
basically you I'll

665
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,840
biz the functional they called the field
Colts

666
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,220
basically when you have where when you
have

667
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,510
air Batum time on my page number im and
the document them yet doodling commenced

668
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,190
what it is

669
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,580
using them in bareback im Ms Ward

670
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,790
its field called basically it's a
specific internal

671
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,470
the kind of is not a programming
language but you can read mall on

672
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,810
Microsoft website

673
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,280
I Venezuela they have various things

674
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,940
about this field goals and one of them
is primp

675
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,400
well basically you come create the new
field called by

676
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,860
using Mysore Cup and you can see what
field goals are into the comment by

677
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,470
selecting both expressing

678
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,070
shift f9 and you'll see holes field
goals appearing like

679
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,630
we have a great background them is like
looking like a mock rock

680
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,950
but is not democracy is like give chords
I don't

681
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,380
home well then what's interesting

682
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,680
is but this spring feel cold

683
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,550
is the hear from wave through eight is
or no

684
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,650
okay maybe mind is I think the because

685
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,630
initially very printers air required the

686
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,100
as specific initialization Kaman's the B
sample

687
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,370
there before paint job could be sent
Street

688
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,500
so what what was bom was introduce this
latest I can escape

689
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,380
it is keeping the printing the physician
to moms

690
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,580
which it sends to the printer im n roll

691
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,100
so basically whatever you type in their
field called

692
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,730
overprinting field goal is stamped

693
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,580
are all Torbay printer is not being
processed by the printer driver

694
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,070
right so they did a few

695
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,400
wanted to percent

696
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,190
if you wanted to San twin let's say

697
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,810
are you the FileUpload come on which %uh
show you

698
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:04,070
missus the simplest the simplest
bijeljina up

699
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,910
top-load the a binary on the filesystem
print

700
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,390
I'll so Wesley you can bump it for
telnet

701
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,260
you can sanded or alter the printer from
up lip

702
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,960
or you'll want to send it well roll

703
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,500
unprocessed to their the from I'll

704
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,660
Ms Ward so percent exact these bites

705
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,500
you need to put this blow-up im

706
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,560
print field called otherwise if you just
put this text

707
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,850
mistakes will get rendered and them
you'll get

708
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,870
only brought the cold operate or some

709
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,600
so it will not accomplish low-level
things we from

710
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,970
okay so I'll show you the okay this is

711
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,480
their well-known displacing like be jail

712
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,100
said to read the message display you
said the mess as you want

713
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,210
bizarre their ropers it says it's a big
deal job

714
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:04,570
the and so on Vigo and job I hear you
could be ok a month

715
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,130
or you can put the Kruskal things like
Brazil imposter

716
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:12,200
want okay and

717
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,350
missus very start basically is the same
without a job

718
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,990
the job name and we say I want

719
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,240
to orderly Recep an HP printer doesn't
work on all model

720
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,600
I one all vendors it's only the

721
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,680
specific to HP but is good enough
basically all over

722
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,270
when those have almost the same thing
okay

723
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:39,090
I'm you

724
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,100
okay who is not quite the little things
because it's like digital design their

725
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,080
think it's

726
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,450
not but you apply pitch in his file
system commands will

727
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,950
will be blocked you cannot these low
because some printers it relies on

728
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,130
phones to be

729
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,320
download it to them and so on and so on
or something salvation

730
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,540
so is very hard to

731
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,280
bike blog his upon my solution boo would
be like

732
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,190
print everything for their toll the
filtering printer like you know keV PDF

733
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,720
or something like this:

734
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,080
the you print first frog your toe
printer you get

735
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,540
the intermittent they dealt with which
is clean of

736
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,760
well print the specific model where
right

737
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,170
and then you will bring the clean their
I file

738
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,530
however the downside is bed

739
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,460
one I you never show if bayview tall

740
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,910
printer driver is okay if my be

741
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,430
malicious for your PC or let's save your
printer driver

742
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,060
is fine but there are some document
exploitative

743
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:44,890
digital printer driver the vulnerability
and exploit services so you're

744
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,790
safeguarding your printer but the
exploit their PC pay the balance

745
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:52,280
I'm okay

746
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,430
a.m. I'll go there vickland have six
minutes

747
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:00,100
okay well with clear service this is
part of

748
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,190
well printer administration the

749
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,840
printer administration interface from HP
but every vendor has

750
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,350
every bit vendor has its own kind of
implementation and its

751
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,430
said sup sup susceptible to

752
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,870
XSS attacks and the bed is bad usually
only up

753
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,180
up means log to to this interface

754
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:27,260
and if you exploit the and if but up
mister there is also a domain or a power

755
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,930
user or power operator on

756
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,250
ever the man the implication is

757
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,620
quite my thing so there are couple it
assesses in

758
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,730
miss tool called the HP Web gentlemen

759
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,220
button in other their present so I'll be
showing quickly

760
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,270
are we I'm usually is being

761
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:53,270
done ok

762
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:05,990
all while

763
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,080
okay so basically use evite missus

764
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,010
are a few is called on a few it's a
remote feel led upgrade

765
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,430
I you see everything is like I'll

766
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,060
rope in my PJ L upgrade among from HP

767
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,060
and is like a binary blob we don't care
now what it is

768
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:30,220
and the if it had like comments page 0
comments

769
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,290
and the idea is bad a whatever

770
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:38,030
the comment this is put here usually

771
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,370
the this the miss this offer trolls

772
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:46,940
as as the here just two to solve
administrator of the model right

773
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,060
and bed is meant to just so

774
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,290
how is done just put their common field
and put

775
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,390
whatever you want does bomb everything
there and

776
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,450
pray for the up mean lol

777
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,730
active domain ok Active Directory means
or whatever you are aiming for

778
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:09,580
I me and that is bad for the

779
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:14,450
very very very installs for download is
the most humorous from HP

780
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:18,010
better used using along the HTTP in all
this BS

781
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:21,420
rights old man in the middle is like
piece of cake and

782
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,280
nobody suspects anything right the you
can put

783
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,260
valid looking the joke among them burn
just easier because

784
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,560
goes from okay now

785
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,270
world if everything else fails I just
ever

786
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:40,240
never nice cute well binary which is
nothing

787
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,720
infectious for bc it is not detected by
Muller for PC

788
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,400
but what'd buzz it connects the last all
port 9100 of the printer and

789
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,500
effect the printer and miss I don't know
any

790
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,780
the under virus Airbender which

791
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,570
takes like the malicious printer
malicious code or

792
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,430
things like this so okay you don't know
that nice place game or

793
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:08,000
and I supplication you just play it by
ear but its effects are printer

794
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,010
okay the and their number frank which
you can

795
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:17,040
be using is there when I do contrition
this thing you should do is

796
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,710
I am bed is you you can and you have
like a jail in my mind like a kiosk

797
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:26,140
right you can a check if pick you ask is
running administrator

798
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,370
the if the jailed environment is it is
being run as administrator

799
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:33,780
how this here for example usually the
printing

800
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,780
is not the limited on vicki was even
though they don't have printer installed

801
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,760
but they don't limit

802
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,330
want them so you go it's like that the
fault XP is like perfect Microsoft

803
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,140
well dislike print the file you select
whatever

804
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,560
gnome of and just overwrite if

805
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,720
if you are to add me im then driver

806
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,980
which prints you to talk to to the
printer

807
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,090
alright but babes printing stream

808
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:03,450
the bat file so you can denial of
service

809
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:07,100
well the cost the second if

810
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,300
but doesn't give an error or I'll you
might be having an admin right

811
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,330
and it might what would be your putting
more effort on exploiting but cost

812
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:21,850
if it's not there a high-level user van
maybe it's not or

813
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:25,710
containing exploiting and second you can
finger print if its windows

814
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:30,620
the Windows 2k you can play with
different parts and so on and so on

815
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,950
so okay now

816
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,450
things we I've found them in the

817
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:41,650
from some of their printers like leaking
secrets secrets or

818
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,260
couple got information is like when a
repost war zone

819
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,140
guess walk creeped of us for the equals

820
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,020
purvis from so you performer perfumer
upgrade

821
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,480
and get like you know the your printer
back to square one

822
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,040
a.m. my phone from in Kruger private
keys

823
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,930
room and the use the for them play in
our fleet of

824
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,310
printers if you about me if you all want
to use

825
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:13,080
HTTPS right you can turn it on and make
their

826
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,780
make their printer are you is this BS

827
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,160
van usually if they have failed to find
certificates

828
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,310
on the printer and usually up means or

829
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:27,490
not usually but some other means choose
to a at the polls

830
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:30,490
birth certificates earth a CA's

831
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,700
to to their coastal the user so he
doesn't get the warning

832
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,550
okay and you get them where the point
where I'm going to have a private keys

833
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:43,240
you have this certificate in the CIA or
the users

834
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,720
well yeah I'm so more things to come

835
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,320
be interesting where ways you can
exploit does leading a private cute

836
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,150
little

837
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,320
well okay fuck exploitation have

838
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,480
for more minutes %um well

839
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,550
reportedly vision basically well some

840
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,880
some of their printers have Fox Models
and as this on you

841
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,510
the PGO parade or you can take a slight
lead on looking through

842
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:12,720
I am a bills Foxconn months

843
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,320
in P gel so basically you're crossed the
document or you when you're the

844
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,200
Pinterest interesting go wrong when
somebody want to exploit

845
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,240
the across the prince three in stream

846
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,140
in Dhaka man so Ryan pent written this
thing you can put this the

847
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,650
some a fuck school month and you can
test however

848
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,800
then have up the of the dial

849
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,890
up and I'll in connections which are
usually not very secure and

850
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,340
if you have a if if you have a dialing
connection what's

851
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,370
quite but for your network 00 customer
network

852
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:47,680
and basically you can test whether
they're using compel

853
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,660
normal PSTN fox or a very using for a
poor folks over IP

854
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,109
thereby yielding sending faxes to
various international numbers in seeing

855
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:57,890
baths and they're all there

856
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:02,560
of the box if it's for IP it's usually
something bonus if it's traditionally

857
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,380
they'll have their

858
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,800
on think and another missus information
caucusing but he basically is like a

859
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,750
reconnaissance

860
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,990
the you can find more about the the

861
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,700
enterprise in this way but governor
approaches money harvesting

862
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,740
malicious user can abusive like having

863
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,330
setup premium numbers right know which
charge like

864
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:27,950
100 euros per minute whatever if they
have accomplished their

865
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:32,250
a.m. and the register a number local
number wave enterprise has

866
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,680
I have a wife says I am send

867
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,340
but kind of document for Fox's initiated
calling to a premium number

868
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,740
print enterprise biz the bill the

869
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,870
malicious you will get the money is a
right so

870
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:50,130
missus also one point thought to keep in
mind when

871
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:53,710
is Dell Inc configuring penetration
testing the

872
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,130
Emma his reflexes so this is the Kaman
said three dozen or Cornwall

873
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,730
over the bus but you have to read the
condition and specific support

874
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:05,430
okay on and come

875
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,960
the lot because I promised I'll be
showing some sneak preview

876
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,140
or okay resnick preview

877
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,340
and we are done because I'm overtime

878
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,130
like pic is and Solihull for the content
which I i

879
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,400
have on this topic unfortunate with
written

880
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,900
not when not very well with by
management

881
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,040
okay world

882
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,240
you okay so basically what we have here

883
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,530
is like I 41 some

884
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,670
you away with being there must be

885
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:50,780
place like home well we have it fine we
do the same trick we connect to

886
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,580
were also look at mine 100 okay

887
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,730
I will not be showing you exactly how
it's done because

888
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,780
it's part of the the some other

889
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,740
talk about to see we have like a shell

890
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,030
okay what I call it shall over it fowler
somewhere where vere

891
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,640
it's like we r bumping specific past

892
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,680
stream to the printer we get like a show
on the

893
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,330
printer which with her have nice
implications you

894
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:24,150
now where bit missus been

895
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:27,690
special Kaman number to which a call
that for his demo

896
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,680
well basically it's a physical operating
system

897
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,460
memory dumper right in better than I
have postscript the

898
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,790
think okay so in the

899
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:44,180
in the be sale joke okay so

900
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,240
well that what that is now the

901
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,320
and you well

902
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,400
okay so you can see a basically

903
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,670
I it's a very specific up

904
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:00,080
be jail and BCL a job print shop

905
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,280
crofter I which we sent to the printer

906
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,080
now we have access to the

907
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,110
on operate physical

908
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,410
and operating system I memory

909
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,370
and basically I've dumped on their part
of memory and the

910
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:21,360
specific of that well I started dumping
you see is 30

911
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,240
possibly their web administrator I

912
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,820
executable on models because guys like
some things which are

913
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,830
from supp things and so on and so on

914
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:37,300
the but its

915
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,960
well with fun thing say is about was a
writer

916
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,740
I just 17 your well as a writer and so
on so

917
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,240
birthday is like very different occasion
once

918
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,390
you can bump the memory you can bumper
filesystem

919
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:54,800
frog print screen a not print

920
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,270
I'll bring think stream them

921
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,560
needs being implications our very
interesting them

922
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,930
accessing or okay if a bring those

923
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,970
have like very this trench memory
management but I have

924
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,990
where BP and so on so on so if you're
start reading or writing a specific

925
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:13,510
addresses

926
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,270
I am have been just good general
protection

927
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:20,330
fault dBF to know eighties like fun like
it is

928
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:23,640
a complete reset the pump room and so on
and so on

929
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,960
so who okay then

930
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,080
a little bit Bush operations I'm

931
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,390
we are %um you

932
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:37,970
boom okay and will so

933
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:42,150
just two to show their their power wheel

934
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,330
we want to communicate or we want up
till now just give an explanation

935
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,450
up till now the communication was
initiated

936
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,430
on the bike got doctor or by the user
targeted by about documenting but

937
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,880
usually every think went to the print
the printer

938
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,230
have a printer were responded pride now

939
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:03,630
what we are accomplished is sending some
from

940
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:07,000
something specific to the printer and
the printer actually

941
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,610
have I was conducted send us something

942
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:15,590
and so on and so on mine just the demo
said this would do a simple pink

943
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:19,520
CI campus with very specific print job

944
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,580
and we have the source which is

945
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,880
are our printer wherewithal nothing to

946
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,140
102 and it is giving in it spinning

947
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,530
our destination which is very busy

948
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,990
running the test okay

949
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,480
so basically just to summarize via this
video while

950
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,860
planes I'll you we have like memory
access

951
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,860
a few while the memory the right from

952
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:52,660
have filesystem ok says have well but
for not not be jailbait

953
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:56,260
is like operating system based in
because they're different file systems

954
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,390
be jelly is one is like a view to a file
system but if you get access to their

955
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,440
host operating system by like this is
like you get

956
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,040
everything from but pen to write and in
just to show is

957
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,430
is like the IP of artist think BC

958
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,850
yes over people's from we instruct the
printer

959
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,430
to bring arts and send a fun thing and
do

960
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:20,890
send those files on so the so we have

961
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,610
network connectivity initiated from the
printer well we have

962
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:28,030
the memory access file system access

963
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,780
basically just a couple of weeks or a
month sound

964
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,850
some kind of a tool kit or will be there

965
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,850
to wrong thing

966
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:41,070
more interesting all the printer and
doing very

967
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:45,280
interesting stuff I'll unfortunately

968
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,880
