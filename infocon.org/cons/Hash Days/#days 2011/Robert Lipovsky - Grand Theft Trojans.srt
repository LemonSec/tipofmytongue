1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,200
on my name is properly Polski

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,289
as though

3
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,419
Renault he sets virus live in Bratislava
today will be speaking about

4
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:25,439
banking Trojans are

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,369
now as we as we all know armoured today
is about

6
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,390
stealing money that's that's a well
known fact

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,149
and they're actually as Lisa different
ways are

8
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:40,239
how the attackers can steal the money
from the victims from

9
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,280
are less obvious ways such as various
shady advertising campaigns

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,489
collecting the user's so browsing habits
stark

11
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:52,290
delivering targeted ops and making money
like this

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,960
indirectly or or the range

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,699
berries anna & example for banking
Trojans

14
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,720
its morse much more straightforward
approach where they would directly

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,140
rob the user all and target his or
online banking

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,930
system or payment system whatever so
world is it today's agenda these are the

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,200
our families that all mainly focusing on
you

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,729
and all I'll be showing our technical
analysis

19
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,140
or boss up for some other features some
of the more interesting features

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,440
all that I that I would like to point
out or

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,960
there the car our our interest hopefully
hopefully not too boring

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll that'll add though are some
statistical

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,290
India but the prep prevalence

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,340
and about the distribution no the
malware

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,119
and during the course of the
presentation I think it'll become

26
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:46,869
obvious

27
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:51,250
are why it's important to deal with the
stuff and why these Mauer families

28
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,490
are significant so I'll

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,080
without further ado let's get to it and

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,390
as an introduction I think II

31
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,619
but this is why do about the zoo since
by I know

32
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,420
I will be focusing on these two there's
is so much said about these

33
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,129
and they've been around offer some quite
so for quite some time

34
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:16,170
are so only for the sake of completeness
some well known facts

35
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,439
are these from our families were rivals
at first our vendors use

36
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,580
all source codes were

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,209
or sold probably dole author stop
development

38
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,680
there's been some something like a
merger between these two families

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,859
and/or these now we're

40
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:38,260
these backing Trojans that use the
common are common techniques over many

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,450
the browser attacks

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,060
then when backs added second factor
authentication like more oh and towns

43
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,590
all SMS messages or they reacted with
using many mobile techniques

44
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,700
where which software mobile malware will
be forwarding

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,049
the security messages to the attackers
and I'll

46
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:00,769
variance of these were targeting or
Symbian Blackberry and Android platform

47
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:01,469
as well

48
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,900
also this is this is a screenshot from
an old

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,120
or spy eye boat builder over here you
can even see

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,629
the option to uninstall Tucson and on an
effective machine

51
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,480
and though even though even a zoo since
by I am

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,409
aren't that hot anymore I'll

53
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,419
there certainly still active they're
still active there

54
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,989
prevalent this is a screenshot from not
not such a long time ago

55
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,849
and it reads it we found this in a
packer

56
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,849
in a custom Packer for Zeus and it has
had he not

57
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,999
nod32 guys are less work was very good I
was really surprised has been over four

58
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:42,029
hours trying to fix the detections

59
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:45,540
but the better man still stands come
along little doggy cum a lot more

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,370
hahahaha

61
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,299
I mean come on the better man still
stands okay whatever

62
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,519
it was quite funny buying this message
into in the malware

63
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,849
but as I was saying up this this power

64
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,790
though is still out there or it's the
oats the Robin users

65
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,839
and I'll be 4i before I continue

66
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:12,150
I added some some statistics serve the
distribution

67
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,970
ok because do since by I another big big
girl all purple

68
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,160
our sector that's rest of the world

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,949
and these ones are turkey Spain Italy
Argentina up for spy it's quite similar

70
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,540
to Zeus and as you can see the
distribution is always pretty global its

71
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,560
Aubrey spread

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,660
all over the world which a lot will not
be the case in though

73
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,650
know in the main in the example that
I'll be focusing on later

74
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,600
well as those will be targeting mostly
Russian speaking countries

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,160
and also originating or from Russian
speaking countries

76
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,300
so let's talk about or RDP door be

77
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,470
RTP door an interesting piece of malware

78
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,610
our first samples were detected in 2010
and the way it works is that

79
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,740
%uh it uses our remote desktop 22

80
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,520
or enable the attacker to log into the
victim's machine

81
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,600
and the attack is pretty pretty manual
so

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,180
this service back to our winning able
the attacker to or connect to the victim

83
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,550
and they will that he will literally
have to watch over his shoulder

84
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,890
and awaits offer him to connect send

85
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,690
to enter some credentials and then or
misuse those

86
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,930
up for for that though this malware uses
so components a legitimate software co

87
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,650
pensive

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,470
thin soft between and also uses some
pretty pretty neat interesting

89
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,430
techniques

90
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,630
for bypassing some security mechanisms a
that has some techniques for

91
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,870
avoiding AB detection and for the Casa
two thousand dollars he would basically

92
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,990
be getting

93
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,180
but builder and the

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,480
access to an administrative our panel

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,450
and/or basically that's that's the price
you keep you can pretty much by this

96
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,280
malware

97
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,460
on under underground black forums and

98
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,870
that's that's that's the way the modem
our work today dub

99
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,920
criminals using it for stealing aren't
necessarily the same ones behind

100
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,360
behind programming and it supports the
whole scheme or

101
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,050
for organized crime

102
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,690
now statistics as I was mentioning are
the big blue part is russia followed by

103
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,810
ukraine and Kazakhstan and the in this
grab will be similar

104
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,690
or with so I'll all the other examples
and the reason why

105
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,280
these so these bad guys are targeting
these countries with this malware

106
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,210
is that they actually our book quite
similar banking system so they're able

107
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,630
or targets all these regions

108
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,910
at the same time with the same same
software

109
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,220
okay let's take a little look cool under
the hood how this works

110
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,670
up the installation of RTP doors pretty
simple %uh

111
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,470
when the droppers run on the affected
computer will send some or system and

112
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,830
information to the a command-and-control
center

113
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,620
and then the command in control server
will authenticate

114
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,580
are the infection and provide the
between all software for insulation

115
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,590
so this is what it looks like that's the
URL up there there are some but I D

116
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,980
that's being sent

117
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,590
%uh information about the system Windows
version Service Pack whether it's all

118
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,880
standard user account over

119
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,210
administrator account then the response
or

120
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,270
there's a standardized or protocol which
RTP doors using starting with this web

121
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,860
tag and then there is an our command are
which is basically sending

122
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,960
I'll sending though components of the
beat when software

123
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,450
are to the infected computer and then

124
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,480
or India then though a client will

125
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,420
respond with status information with the
installation was successful or not

126
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,100
and right there it is that every
everything went okay

127
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,250
okay I have a little demo showing you
how

128
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,389
are the attackers actually steal the
login information

129
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,810
offer the computer and

130
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,560
this is this is how it works it's
installing an extension

131
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,070
upward gino raffle left graphical

132
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:20,150
are authentication

133
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,930
so infected though machine on a virtual
replicator

134
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,120
that's the sample that was run Rd
petered out a

135
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,329
now we're were checking in record it or
where the appropriate

136
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:37,560
all registry entry was made for the

137
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Gina extension

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,350
and there it is Gina D lol is showing
two XT gino

139
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,500
dodi level which is the extension or
drop by the malware

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,530
was that ends what's months that
installed will

141
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:05,530
re start the system wills

142
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,230
fire up poor Wireshark

143
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,870
on the host so we can see what its

144
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,530
sending out what's what is communicating
enter

145
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,500
the password username is is
administrator password is password

146
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,300
switch back to Wireshark and

147
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:32,300
wait for it

148
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,700
moment surprise

149
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,370
and there it is user name administrator
and the password

150
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,930
followed by the computer name and the
fact that it's an administrator account

151
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,420
so using this

152
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:02,420
simple yet effective technique though

153
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,040
attackers are able to get the log in
correct credentials of the victim

154
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,120
and then using the between are
components

155
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,580
they will remotely connect or to the
computer and/or the advantage of using

156
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,360
this between

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,690
between software is that so is that so
that user will not actually be logged

158
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,710
out every session

159
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,020
so he they will literally be watching
over his shoulder

160
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,030
and waiting for him all to Axis Bank

161
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,430
obvious that these are some of the
commands of from the protocol

162
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,670
RTP doors using or the Morse

163
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,950
more interesting ones remember are that
was from the installation

164
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,360
are used over there up twenty

165
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,240
r is for between back in action knows
initialization

166
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,320
are with their function one already
enables RDP door

167
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,110
or to deal with an 80 and then the you
command

168
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,780
or is used for updating the modules of
the malware

169
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,040
so without the you command or

170
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,260
a new dropper with the new configuration
in bed inside

171
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,280
will be provided very simple nowhere but

172
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,420
so quite effective actually are showed
or

173
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,570
is something similar or the price on the
black market

174
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,950
is is also quite similar %uh its the

175
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,510
emo or Bush shoulder and dole RTP door

176
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,570
are quite is or pretty much the same the
attacker

177
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,840
will be all trying

178
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,300
trying to or connects to the victim or
through

179
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,400
with remote access but doesn't use
between or software this time it uses

180
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,170
TeamViewer

181
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,600
which is again a legitimate application
and the

182
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,410
and the the advantage of using a legend
application that is signed

183
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,500
all one advantage is that so

184
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,530
it is able to avoid suspicion it is so
sign components

185
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,750
so with up at first glance appears

186
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,860
pretty legitimate and the second up
second advantage is that so using

187
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,590
TeamViewer adds another level

188
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,790
and enemies into the club beat service
statistics

189
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,800
again quite similar

190
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,590
before Russia Ukraine Kazakhstan this
illustration actually shows

191
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,940
on how the TeamViewer or connections
work

192
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,470
so first or the affected so host

193
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,760
the affected by what would cut contact
the team York router squiggle press the

194
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,470
cloud ID

195
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,990
up the crowd though would reply are then
this so I D

196
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,340
will be set on the client and then

197
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,480
all due to the infected though by the

198
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,790
infected binary will or the militias
binary will connect to the shoulder CNC

199
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,470
and send or the TeamViewer credentials

200
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,360
to the attacker and once he has that or
there's nothing standing in his way to

201
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,980
connect

202
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,490
to the computer by a the TeamViewer
infrastructure

203
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,170
articulate taken little loco under the
hood

204
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,760
up these are the components of a
legitimate ones

205
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,050
that's the team your eggs in TeamViewer
or DLL

206
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,970
are with them our put in place is a it's
our TV DLL

207
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,440
which X as a proxy deal all basically it
does some simple

208
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,720
ordeal hooking and all this is what it's
all looks like inside the deal

209
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,910
are these are the functions of the deal
there be poked this is where the

210
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,920
original TS dealers loaded

211
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,630
are the function hooks are installed
down here you can even see

212
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,410
are the command control URL are

213
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,710
these are the BOC BOC manse that's all
shoulder is using there's there's the

214
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,090
though ability to download and execute
additional modules thus greatly

215
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,930
expanding

216
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,980
all the functionality the capabilities
of the malware

217
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,990
or there's a cool feature to delete all
the files

218
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,230
to hide his tracks and stuff like that
and though as I said

219
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,900
I'll well this malware is not only

220
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,000
for all technically skilled people

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,660
up any anyone any criminal basically is
able to buy this

222
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,460
and/or you crime using these tools

223
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,190
so this is a screenshot from moreover
user perspective

224
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,250
on this malware this was taken after

225
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,240
or a takedown of one of them wanna the C
and C's

226
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,790
and what you can see here are the
different banks or which

227
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,650
though which the malware is targeting
these a Russian banks I bank

228
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,760
BSS be as bees bear cetera et cetera

229
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,600
okay car burping car burp on like

230
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,030
the previous two examples is slightly
more sophisticated

231
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,730
and the price tag also or confirms that
sits

232
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,840
it's more expensive and

233
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,370
to for this price what will what will
the law client the criminal be getting

234
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,790
are is he's again getting an access to a
boat builder

235
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,950
to an administrative panel and/or

236
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,980
this this malware unlike the previous
two examples

237
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,740
works differently this is a much more
sophisticated and advanced malware

238
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,920
are it's not your eyes there are plugins
for its plug-ins which are targeted

239
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,890
directly at specific banks and depending
on the model on the modules the plugins

240
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,940
that you're buying

241
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,960
on the price will depend on that and
also

242
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,420
or the amount and the level of support
that's right these or

243
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,610
people are are also providing support or
for this malware

244
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,800
our technical support and also stuff
like they will provide you a new variant

245
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,110
once or these so but is being detected
by a bee engines

246
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,490
and stuff like that so we're in another

247
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,610
another important of fact about Harbor
is that is not its

248
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,830
also sold on about four hours but is not
thought to ever also it somewhere close

249
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,000
circle

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,640
well as I was that it's our customizable
to target specific banks

251
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,800
and the way it works similarly like call
Zeus and

252
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,590
spy I is that using man in the browser
techniques or

253
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,930
its installs or the dll's

254
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,660
injects the OAS into Internet Explorer
and Firefox and

255
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,650
its it is really a grant of Trojan there
are real world incidents

256
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,210
are where usage of harbor porpoise
proven

257
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,590
and these are cases where millions of
dollars were stolen

258
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,410
so statistics other two pie charts

259
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,810
or this time the last time I did a
presentation on Harbor

260
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,170
office at the chart used in again Russia
is the in the first place followed by

261
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,000
Ukraine

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,060
but the point I was making is that this
time our car burp

263
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,120
attackers are expanding and

264
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,710
attacking more globally there's Ukraine
is followed by Spain

265
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,180
and the United States so it's not only
focusing on

266
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,490
on the russian-speaking region and

267
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,640
then when I updated this crap

268
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,170
with his presentation from April 2011 to

269
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,100
present it's still the same graph as
we've seen with for

270
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,670
Russia Ukraine as it's done there in
fourth place

271
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,670
so previously I was saying that okay
there

272
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,810
globalizing their broadening their
horizons now what they

273
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,160
they're going back well the reason for
this is an actually that's

274
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,190
all they're pulling up pulling away

275
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,959
from the global markets but they were
actually

276
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,070
the reason for that is not that there's
less the texan's

277
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,250
are in the US safe harbor but there's
much much more detections

278
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,500
in Russia for example missus though are
these are time statistics

279
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,920
up for russia as as you can see at this
period of time

280
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,370
May and June love this year it has
increased rapidly in the reasons for

281
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,340
this

282
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,880
is that several cyber criminal groups
are behind

283
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,240
our car burp so basically more people
have been working on this more people

284
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,890
have been

285
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,990
using it there were changes are in
though

286
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,710
in the people behind that and these
changes are quite visible during our

287
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,800
analysis of the code as well and on the
bright side though

288
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,350
or other there have been also of you are
successful takedowns a command control

289
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,670
all servers of for car burp which were
coordinated by

290
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,440
or group IB which is the main company
are doing the investigations of a cyber

291
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,830
crime in Russia

292
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,020
are assisted by the Russian police and
about the

293
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,340
most visible or impact that it had on
the on the

294
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,100
sections %uh is between November and
December where there was quite a

295
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,130
dramatic or

296
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,850
or decline thanks to the takedown of a
couple for C&C servers

297
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,820
okay these are the book a man's that
corporate is using to put out

298
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,140
point out or sum up the more more
interesting ones

299
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,590
are theirs the kill user option which so

300
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,900
is there to better cover or their tracks

301
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,920
for the attackers where the the whole
winder

302
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,070
Windows user account would be deleted

303
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,290
and thus making forensic analysis is a
bit harder

304
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,140
Kerber as I said it is it is much more
sophisticated than the previous two

305
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,040
examples

306
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,320
it has some more pretty nice or self

307
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,110
protection mechanisms are it has
techniques were backed by passing a BME

308
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,900
laters

309
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,090
all such as doing many calls over gaya
PI's

310
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,390
and no code injection method has changed
between these two versions

311
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,410
of Carver before he was using the EE
reason thread

312
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,810
I'll the later version was using the BBQ
ABC thread

313
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,980
are the later version also I was using
an encryption algorithm

314
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,700
for encrypting its commands and the
strings inside the binary

315
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,860
are it would do better a better job of
authenticating

316
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,780
all on the CNC so what will be much
harder

317
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,950
to infiltrate the botnet and carry out
an investigation

318
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,910
and a couple a couple of other or other
tricks import as well some basic

319
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,010
coverage good techniques for hiding in
the system

320
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,780
detecting the hoops all installed by a
bee engines and

321
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,610
on installing them on hooking and stuff
like that

322
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,010
now as for the distribution all the bad
guys either 100 handle

323
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,140
it themselves so that it should be
directly were

324
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,880
the basically there would only be paying
for the traffic or they were distributed

325
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,160
by partners

326
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,410
all the typical paper install schemes

327
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,410
or partner for the programs and a
typical takings for disturbing my were

328
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,850
used by Harris

329
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,480
SEO infected blogs try Bart drive-by
downloads

330
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,000
and up and instances where up the impact
exploit pack was used

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,050
were quite numerous as well

332
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,940
okay so here's here's again a user
user's perspective

333
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,340
all of the malware know this is a

334
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,970
car burp control panel as you can see
wouldn't come we didn't come up with the

335
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,540
name ourselves

336
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,840
are the bad guys named its and though

337
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,900
to put out the more the interesting
parts here this prefix column that's the

338
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,320
affiliate ID

339
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,530
so the attacker will actually know who
to pay

340
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,080
in their paper install scheme as you can
see here

341
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,140
its they're a bunch of zeros in the
right column so this

342
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,160
sea creature was taken after a takedown

343
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,380
above the C&C server and are here
there's there's the bar the controls

344
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,520
for controlling the individual pots all

345
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,350
there's an option to execute commands
and

346
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,440
a remote shell stuff like that

347
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,250
here's the back settings up the control
panel

348
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,590
the interesting fact here is that so
some limits for the train to

349
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,090
transactions can be made so was so ok
banks

350
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,490
aren't suspicious if large amount of
money

351
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,370
is withdrawn at at at a single in a
single transaction

352
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,530
and I over here you can see the
different back to the car Berbice

353
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,420
targetting as

354
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,070
targeting as you can see these are only
Russian banks there's a jazz BC Uruk

355
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,020
their net or banks in the Netherlands
Israel

356
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,360
germans park %uh sir all latvian banks

357
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,030
so pretty global pretty global targeting
the harbor

358
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,590
and also after after those takedowns
that I was mentioning

359
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:22,470
are we we've seen all the stolen data
that was so

360
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,890
that the attackers lay their hands on
that was a lot of stolen data

361
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,190
this is this is a screenshot of over
7,000 cab archives with sensitive user

362
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,330
information

363
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,700
inside them all it contain all the
information that

364
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,240
that the attackers were interested in
asking charts loading zone banking

365
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,750
credentials key logs

366
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:46,880
and stuff like that for different
different payment systems cyber plots

367
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,500
I back internet banking client used by
different banks

368
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,580
another one this is a Ukrainian bank

369
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,860
okay so let's go in let's compare

370
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,450
up the difference stealing tools as a
said these are these are basically

371
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,179
weapons in the hands of criminals

372
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:08,380
for stealing the victim's money and I'll

373
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,470
as against as as I said before carb is
the most technically advanced

374
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,929
I'll add it all up these and is also

375
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,150
its horizon that and the its

376
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,360
the scope that it's targeting the
country's it so much wider

377
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,140
up the functionality that is using for
remote access is different in all of

378
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
these three

379
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,320
a coverup is almost twice targeting
specific banks

380
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,850
and over here all the information doing
has to be done manually

381
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,280
the complexity above the cold or when a
reverse engineering

382
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,810
obviously is the most is the highest
with Carver

383
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,500
and the similarity between all these is
that they all form but let's

384
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,500
got obviously these aren't the only on
our families

385
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,820
all designated for this purpose apart
from all those that have been mentioning

386
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,410
there's

387
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,480
she's there which is our one of the
first

388
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,540
sophisticated though banking Trojans
targeting

389
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,130
banks in Russia perspire NBS but cyber
which as the name suggest

390
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,100
targets though cyber plaid payment
system and I week

391
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,740
which is starting the Kiwi payment
system

392
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,990
okay and lets let's not move something a
little bit different gets

393
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,240
very closely connected to all these

394
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,070
and that's hot pot

395
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,340
statistics again pretty similar

396
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,810
now hotpot is a downloader so it's

397
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,590
it's it's a tool which which cooperates
with all these

398
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,070
Mauer families that I was just
mentioning there were instances found

399
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,420
were hot pot would be

400
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,200
downloading RTP door shelter or plot
cyber car burp

401
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,150
and others and though it isn't it isn't
up

402
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,100
simple Trojan downloader either it
features some pretty interesting

403
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,360
our techniques or summat I forensic

404
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,480
so methods and basically

405
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,550
techniques which are or doing mosier
making our jobs

406
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,960
more difficult and it's been associated
with real-world incidents

407
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,200
where a lot of money was stolen but
let's let's take a closer look at the

408
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,429
technical details

409
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:19,780
a pop-rock so or the insulation its

410
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,160
it starts becoming interesting from the
very start

411
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,960
unlike the simpler are backing trojans
which would after installation

412
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
first directly contact are the CNC

413
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,120
not on the witness download updates of
it cetera hotpot

414
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,660
first penetrates the system better we
settles in

415
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,990
before it before it starts doing its all
its dirty work are

416
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,380
it consists of several modules all

417
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,770
I'll describe each of them %uh in
greater detail

418
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,340
yes and techniques for bypassing AB's an
intrusion prevention systems

419
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,610
are its using the at print processor
trick during the installation

420
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,660
now for those of you that our are
following our analysis

421
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,860
all probably know that so this isn't
unique and this was inspired by some

422
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,140
malware before so who knows which power
that was

423
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,030
check if you're not asleep yet

424
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,160
that's TDL the famous or all Murray
kriti deal rootkit

425
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,919
are which or which is well known for
using this trick

426
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,410
up the driver it uses it undocumented
way

427
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,690
aren't in on common way overboard
loading the driver

428
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,500
by using this at all he says is him
information all

429
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,510
native API with the system a driver

430
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,760
%uh parameter unlike though common way

431
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,020
installing drivers as registering them
as a service

432
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,770
and the mall most interesting probably
is that it's stored as program called in

433
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,060
the registry instead of

434
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,230
files as on the disk so

435
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,510
clearly it's obvious that all the hot
product creators are following the

436
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,950
trends of modern Mauer

437
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,190
rootkits because as you all know are

438
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,180
rootkits in the past what they would do
is that they would try to hide the

439
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,230
processes on this is the malicious
processes on the system

440
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,930
they would hide the malicious files in
the file system

441
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,340
whereas modern Ricketts they would try
to avoid this

442
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,220
suspicious behavior this hooking that
could give it up give it away

443
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,660
and try try to bypass files altogether

444
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,920
suggested you know stories they tend to
run in raw sectors

445
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,890
in Iraq as raw bytes so on at at the end
of the hard drive

446
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,600
a piece of bacon let's take a look at so
the installation steps

447
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,140
are better done better taken by heart
problem so first

448
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,440
a setup API DLL is dropped in the did

449
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,080
in the directory of the browsers on the
system all the malware

450
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,780
or support center next for Opera and
Firefox

451
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,840
and following that are the ad print
processor technique is used

452
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,200
are to load the module and if that fails
due to some are problems with admin

453
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,850
rights

454
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,570
all the malware no escalate the
privileges by using the MS 10-15

455
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,410
vulnerability

456
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,840
if it succeeds it will disable the
Windows file protection service

457
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,640
and after that it will replace the SFC
files DLL

458
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,290
and store the original file in the
registry

459
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,360
I'll explain what the purpose of this is
in just a second

460
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,610
then it drops unloads the most driver
using that

461
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,140
on common technique that I just mention
then it's than activates the whole pill

462
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,350
deference installed

463
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,910
by opening up a default browser

464
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,940
and navigating to google.com

465
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,510
okay so the code in the registry the
main main binaries the main cold

466
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,230
or the malware is stored in the registry
like this it's

467
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:52,880
encrypted using are some custom Saurer
and irritation and stuff like that

468
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,250
and though these are the five five
richest ricky's

469
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,070
that the mauer is using Core settings is
used to store

470
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,640
the main module the main but module all

471
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,960
or the Trojan in this key

472
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,780
the original a subsea files de lo is
stored

473
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,830
this one or is the binary the kernel
driver image

474
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,270
over here is some loader cold which is
used to load the main what you

475
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,360
and then in the last 1/2 seed is where
the malware stored it in cryptid

476
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,290
are CNC URL's

477
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,940
so to get to get the whole picture as
you see there's some different

478
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,300
components to the Maori might get a be
confusing

479
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,050
I'll so so this is this is because this
is the code stored

480
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:42,850
are inside inside the registry there's
lotta code is the main bar module

481
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:48,170
their the C&C URL's and plus there are
these two API setup API DLL

482
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,720
and SSE files the A level and also the
kernel driver

483
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,510
so what is obvious for what's what's the
purpose were what

484
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,090
what's the all infrastructure or
implemented

485
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,750
by this power to set up API DLL as I
said that's the

486
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,920
thats though deal well that's dropped
into the

487
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,990
installation directories of the browsers
on the system

488
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,410
%uh interesting interesting technique
that it's using

489
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,220
to inject this deal well into the
browser's after space

490
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,970
is called the little hijacking so

491
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,240
when when this so browser process will
be started the windows loader what it

492
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,220
would do

493
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,210
is due to first check wet the D the what
the weather the deal is located in the

494
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,720
present correct directory

495
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,510
where the all process image

496
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,530
is starting is yeah is located

497
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,390
and if it's not there it will search the
path or environment variable

498
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,590
and Woodford directors directories
listed there so that

499
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,880
but the legitimate it a bigger deal is
in the system directory

500
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,370
so when the malware drops its its audio
into these

501
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,570
directories the militias the law will be
loading is that a bill

502
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,240
legitimate one the purpose of the DLL

503
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,490
is to get into the browser's address
space into injects

504
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,990
are inject the main bookmark your from
the registry that I was just showing

505
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,650
before

506
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:20,850
SFC files de lo all that has to do with

507
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,250
Windows file protection that I was
mentioning during the installation phase

508
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,250
that's been disabled and of this

509
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,850
gets onto the infected system by
overwriting

510
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,710
up a legitimate so DLL and the original
is stored in the registry

511
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,050
and/or its purpose is so wanna

512
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,870
to be started are one so was the
operation

513
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,400
operating system is started have to
reboot

514
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,370
and/or to load the driver if it's not
running

515
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,660
and it also also has the capability to
update

516
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,820
the software know the advantage of that
is that

517
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:03,360
it's loaded by win log on XD which is a
trusted system process

518
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,810
and the driver SFC sis now

519
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,910
what that is doing its purpose

520
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,970
is the same as with setup API DLL to
load the main bar mod your

521
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,270
into the browser now as you can see
there is some duplicity

522
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,680
in the functionality of these different
models

523
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,300
which I'll show was how all

524
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,610
how much work the authors of hot pot had
put into their creation

525
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,380
and basically they're creating backup
mechanisms in case one

526
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,330
one of them fails and a making making
the malware

527
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,530
much more difficult to remove from the
infected system

528
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:44,730
so what what the driver drivers doing is
that into registers the low-dimensional

529
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,510
if I

530
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,520
routine or call back function

531
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,910
which gets triggered by the by the
windows loader or whenever an image

532
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,370
whenever module is loaded and any checks
whether

533
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,530
wanna be loaded modules is wannabes when
in a deal and so on

534
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,900
used by browsers and if it if it is

535
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,020
the browser injection takes place

536
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,840
okay so so there's are quite a lot of
are quite a lot of module so let's see

537
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,360
how

538
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,430
how this is interconnected as a said the
heart up though Trojan

539
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,350
are the main components are stored
Norris Pyles but in the registry that's

540
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,600
over here

541
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,180
and the SFC files DLL well which is
residing in the wing of an outer space

542
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,460
loaded by when look on during the
start-up of the system

543
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,650
is able to update this payload and also
make sure

544
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,780
that the driver the kernel driver is
loaded

545
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,840
and that the purpose of the driver then
is

546
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,960
to make sure that's the payload

547
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,480
the main bought module will be injected
into the browser

548
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,560
address space and the same or same
functionality is implemented by that

549
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,880
setup API DLL

550
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,040
which was dropped injured or browser out

551
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,840
browser or directory so this publicity

552
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,360
back a mechanism implemented by the
malware

553
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,169
you know and while ripe for describe
this architecture

554
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:14,460
all around around Mauer the installation
and the self-protection

555
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,859
techniques that is using I'll the main
thing obviously that's using instance it

556
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:19,660
so

557
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,620
or since it's a bot is of the main
module

558
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,220
and though here here though techniques
are a pretty obvious it

559
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,510
contact the remote server requests some
additional

560
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,810
now where to download and execute and
I'll

561
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,760
just to highlight so a quite a quite an
interesting technique that this so

562
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,140
or model is using is that the request
that it's so

563
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,950
using that it's building up to contact
the C and C's

564
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,419
up there they're building up with some
junk values

565
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:55,750
so there will be the the target URL
either from the URL

566
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,609
list encrypt it in the registry horse it
has alternatives

567
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:03,010
embedded inside the binary and then
there will be some

568
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,170
parameters and about the Standard
limited and

569
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,160
the number of these parameters is not
fixed actually it's it's a random

570
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,490
or random amount from five to nine

571
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,730
and one thing that it sends in each case
is the bar ID

572
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,950
so so the attacker %uh is able to
identify

573
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,120
or the infection but then then

574
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,140
additional junk is is adage to this HTTP
request

575
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,210
are such as the promise you wanna be
strings

576
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,670
and others as well and the value is one
of these are these

577
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,319
these have no specific purpose and why
is the malware using these well thats

578
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:45,069
to avoid recognizable patterns in the
network communication

579
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:48,859
so this is what it looks like in no in
it was traded

580
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:52,460
form are the client will will send a
request

581
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,520
to the C&C server which will reply are
with

582
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,410
though with the law execute a bull with
the other

583
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,160
malware such a Scarborough or shoulder
or RDP door for example

584
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,620
it's compressed with AP lip and that
will be

585
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,390
executed on the infected machine and
then a status information will be said

586
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,620
whether the installation

587
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,180
was successful or not okay quite a lot
of statistics are included in my

588
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,569
presentation

589
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:23,200
here's another one which shows or the
relative ratio I just wanted to show how

590
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,819
much

591
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:27,380
up each of these families that have just
described or

592
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,800
is out there all so as you can see

593
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,950
over here in the top the barely visible
red and blue colors belong to shell door

594
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,140
and RDP door now that is not to say

595
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,220
that saw these families are
insignificant

596
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,069
these detections are still in the
numbers of thousands and

597
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,020
people are getting or are having two
parts

598
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,410
or with their money or thanks to these
Trojans

599
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,790
but that is to show are how much how
much

600
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,089
all for hop prod Inc Arbor is actually
out there

601
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:05,440
so hot pot as it's as if the downloader
all

602
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,580
downloading in infecting other computers
and delivering other malware other

603
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,069
markings

604
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:13,609
banking Trojans onto the system has the
greatest share are all these

605
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,770
for families and I already mentioned

606
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,550
though similarity in the installation
with 30 DL

607
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,290
and if you think about it though
functionality

608
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,540
reminds me of tedious work as well since
TDR would

609
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,690
or infect the system use pretty advanced

610
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,850
or repeat techniques and then allow are

611
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:40,150
other third-party Mauer to be loaded on
the infected system

612
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,800
so I think the question of why we need
to pay attention to what this Maori all

613
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,290
these families has been answered

614
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,230
during the presentation I mean this is
this is these are tools

615
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,770
which the attackers the criminals are
using to steal

616
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,900
money from the victim to steal a lot of
money and just to give you an example

617
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,240
of how much they're stealing these are

618
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,330
these are some numbers from the
investigations carried out by group IB

619
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,839
your separates or group which this one
was stealing

620
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:12,950
over 24 million dollars over a period of
time this these

621
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,720
these bad guys we're seeing or $26
million dollars

622
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,069
and according to the group IB reports
the global cybercrime TRO over

623
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:26,730
4 2010 was seven billion dollars that's
quite quite an astonishing number

624
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,130
and bill share of Russia speaking
countries

625
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,190
I love this horrific figure is over
one-third

626
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,710
now these numbers are for 2010 this
report was

627
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,020
all was published this year

628
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,670
and it's already already known that so
in the second half of 2010

629
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,750
are there has been no no tips or
noticeable increase

630
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,100
in or cyber crime related to banking
Trojans

631
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,779
so were expecting or

632
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,000
the numbers for 2011 to be even higher
and report will be

633
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,500
out or in the first quarter of next year

634
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,859
so to finish up my presentation are as I
said

635
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:09,250
these backing Trojans are used as
weapons and

636
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,580
they're targeting targeting no victims

637
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,760
globally but though share

638
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,800
russian-speaking countries is are quite

639
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,580
quite remarkable and these countries are
both the red

640
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,850
origin up for of these Trojans as well
as

641
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,510
targets of the criminals and you say
that

642
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,770
the solutions so would be cooperation
and is probably a few

643
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,450
cliche are but its it's not only
necessary to compete to communicate to

644
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,680
our between

645
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,120
all peers in in in the industry
different maybe companies

646
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,140
do this do this so our communication all
the time also different sectors of the

647
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,620
security industry

648
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,160
all such as a AB companies or law
enforcement

649
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,440
banks et cetera et cetera so

650
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,580
while while and a good anti virus can be

651
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,330
thought about as a bulletproof vest the
real solution

652
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,760
will be to stop the person shooting

653
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,510
and hopefully if we do it well we'll be
seeing more headlines like this

654
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,730
these these people or were arrested by
the Russian police

655
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,520
and this group was actually using the
shoulder or all

656
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,910
banking Trojan and among other

657
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,109
instances of theft

658
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:27,180
are these guys also stole

659
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,040
over six hundred thousand dollars in a
single transaction

660
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,100
that's probably not a very good idea

661
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,950
and also this headline up this guy is

662
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,750
are pretty famous our bill group lipsky
a major player

663
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,230
in though or a Russian cybercrime

664
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:51,260
business are where mainly mainly
focusing on our row cabey's

665
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,000
where his or company crime pays the
largest processor of the payment

666
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,290
up the online payments and basically
enabling

667
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,990
the criminals to cash out are from the
dirty business

668
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,060
he was arrested this summer

669
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,359
so a big thank you to my colleagues have
a great

670
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:12,700
upgrades or sharp work on this
presentation knowledge in a month or so

671
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,370
and Eugene audio from he said and
imagery volkov from group I B

672
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,210
and thanks to you all for attention
