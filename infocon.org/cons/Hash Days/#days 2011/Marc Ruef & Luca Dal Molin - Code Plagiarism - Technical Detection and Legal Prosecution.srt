1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,230
yeah hello a very nice to see

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,940
so many faces of Turkey

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,980
party um we hear

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,520
to present to you the topic told
plagiarism

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,360
its not really a talk that fits
perfectly into

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,160
this event because it's not really about
information security but I think it's

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,629
very interesting for most of aus because
most of us are

8
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:39,530
creating software and distributing
software anthem yet

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,940
useful to know for legal background of
distributing software

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,940
am been as you can see we are two
speakers

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,909
am we have divide its our
responsibilities

12
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:00,600
my part will be am I will do a lot of
storytelling

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,500
I will present a story that I have
experienced a few years ago

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,100
so therefore I will be responsible for
the entertainment part

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,970
of this talk and my friend Luca will be
ok

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,100
bringing the contents he is responsible
responsible for the legal part

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,680
mmm there well my name is Mark roof

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,840
I'm here from Switzerland working for a
company in Zurich

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,560
primarily and doing penetration testing

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,810
i have a web site and I have published a
few books

21
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,840
some of them I am proud of and some of
them

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,570
I aren't very proud of yeah my name is
look at Al million

23
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,940
I am calls from Switzerland foreign in
Zurich studied in Zurich and

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,130
now I work in Zurich a work at their
hamburger

25
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,370
which is a be law firm in Zurich

26
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,660
and I worked there in the IP it.
practice group

27
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,710
which is a group which mainly focuses on
intellectual property law

28
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,120
and also it-related legal

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,570
problems how Markoff I

30
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,729
okay so term first IPL we're going to
talk about coat

31
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,250
plagiarism here's the definition of the
Oxford English Dictionary

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,650
what like a reason is I think a.m.

33
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,599
most people in information security
business are quite familiar with the

34
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,980
problem of plagiarism

35
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,920
a also because of a person that called
in hand himself

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,790
the number one hater of the world's am
but here we are going to discuss call

37
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,580
takers in

38
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,870
so we're somebody using someone else's
code and

39
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,060
he starts the top firsters storytelling

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,069
my story starts 2003

41
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,970
a few years ago am most of you might
remember the time

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,850
where it was not very easy to do
exploitation it was very hard if you

43
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,500
were

44
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,160
professional pen tester to collect all
your exploits to to maintain them

45
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,860
to term provide are certain level of
quality for your exploits

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,150
am I thought it was always very annoying

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,560
if I was at a customer site and I had to
do some exploitation

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,650
to find the right exploits and 22
prepared them correctly in to remember

49
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,910
to send texan what they were doing in
what kind of payload I have to use

50
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,490
whatever

51
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,630
so i thought okay and maybe it's a good
idea for me

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,860
to create a softer which would help me
to do just kind of exploitation

53
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,030
to to streamline the whole process and I
started to create

54
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,160
on exploiting framework which wasn't
although didn't became

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,910
such famous like me this ploy a.m. but
this

56
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,870
is or what's my project the attack
toolkits and

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,480
the ATK from a.m. the basic idea was

58
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,900
a it should be very very simple to
create exploits

59
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,250
so if I was at a customer site I the

60
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,880
the best thing would be I would be able
to create an and exploiting their just a

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,620
few minutes

62
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,680
am the whole framework was plugging
based so dirty the

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,250
exploits were stored indifferent finance
like sugar

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,319
it was very popular if missus back at
the time

65
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,360
button and it was a real fun project for
me because I I was doing something

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,870
that helped me on a daily basis and I
had the chance to

67
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,030
from to see how although projects were
working for example

68
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,030
I crated a.m. a very dynamic reporting

69
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,490
module which allowed me for example to
create reports that looked like

70
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,849
its came from manassas when ability
scanner

71
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:37,879
I was supporting different formats that
in essence

72
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,840
former and in some cases get a que was
he

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,370
impossible to rum nuttal scripts from
the neces- project

74
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,249
what I was using ASL scripts a
salesman's for

75
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:52,879
attack scripting language which was a
very very simple

76
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,999
language to create my exploits to that
the goal was always

77
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:02,009
and it would be the best if I was able
to create an exploitive tossed

78
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,710
one-liner so it was very easy and very
quick to create exploits

79
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,210
at the project became pretty popular

80
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,699
a.m. there were different web sites and
different books that mentioned the

81
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,969
project and I was very happy I had
contact with different people

82
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:20,789
her finest been busted became very
popular into Asian

83
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,300
culture which raced on which rose
different problems for example

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,389
if someone from Taiwan thanks you a.m.

85
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,169
an email and says hey I have a problem
with the software I come

86
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,839
execute what so ever when you say
usually you say okay please send me a

87
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,479
screenshot of the error message

88
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,990
and if you get an error message from a
taiwanese Windows

89
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,819
system you can't really a on the stand
what's going on

90
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,819
therefore did debugging process sparse

91
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,509
very different from as into it pac-10

92
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm but

93
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,199
with every adventure there are some from
risks

94
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,110
a and in my case and by the way I'm
using

95
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,020
all original documents in this
presentation so most of the

96
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,740
conversations are in German so perhaps
not all of you

97
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,750
get the content but I'd like to to
provide the highest level of art

98
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,889
authenticity for the whole presentation
one day I received

99
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,279
this email from a personal I didn't know
back ten mmm 14

100
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,789
followed my work and he knew a few
people around me

101
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:30,409
and he said he was a journalist that
received in

102
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,460
an application he shoots the review

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,659
for a magazine or a website

104
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,240
it was a security scanner and when he
launched

105
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,419
the security scanner he sold at their
poor

106
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,219
ever a.m. a large amount the from United
familiar it is

107
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:51,370
this my educate project so he wrote me
this email and said okay

108
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,250
it might be that they that they are
using some kind of code of some kind of

109
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,099
stuff you were using your project

110
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,269
am I can remember very good

111
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:05,349
I'm at this time I was at a customer
site doing a pen to soften online

112
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,729
banking receive this e-mail

113
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,789
and I was very eager to go home and to
see what really what's going on

114
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:16,269
I went home I downloaded the software
day it we're providing a trial version

115
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,979
on website I downloaded the software
installed the softer

116
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,099
executed the software and as you can see
on the left hand side

117
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,620
Eastgate TK and on the right hand side
is to exploiting

118
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,719
Madhu of dis software and as you can see

119
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:36,199
a.m. their are exactly the same plug in
state

120
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,769
exactly the same exploit plugins I was
providing were

121
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:43,039
also in their product button I have to
sign

122
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,500
essay i've released my soccer on the
General Public License

123
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,190
and day were selling their software for
several hundred euros

124
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,680
so I wasn't very pleased because did
wasn't

125
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,939
really my idea of publishing software

126
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,019
a.m. I wrote them an email

127
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:05,169
to their software was precompiled stay
didn't them

128
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,860
abated the the tell Public License I
wrote em

129
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,990
a letter explaining all came it might be
that there's some confusion

130
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,750
you might not be very familiar with the
GPL and I'd like to say he

131
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,560
police abated GPL and named it the
source the original source

132
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,979
and make the source code of your
application or at least the parts

133
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,039
you wear taking from my project also
open source

134
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,180
am I sent this letter very friendly
letter

135
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,969
I took my time and I received another
letter from Taylor

136
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,519
lawyer I'm and he told me a

137
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,719
we can see a problem a.m. the

138
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,829
did the main developer of this product
is

139
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,920
a.m. very ill he's going to diet but he
told austat

140
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,390
he didn't take any

141
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,319
coat from your project so mmm I'm very
sorry for

142
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:01,740
the person that this going to die but
some that doesn't really concern me

143
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,490
because

144
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,459
them yeah I have Meyer you know

145
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,880
opinions to so are roads another letter
mmm

146
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,920
and said no please be kind police their

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,290
I have proof please don't make this any
harder than it is

148
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,149
ants to what makes sense an

149
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,649
once again I received another letter and
a Sat

150
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,689
no we really we don't care what the
problem is

151
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:31,390
we don't see a problem please go away so
i thought okay

152
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,939
that's not funny it doesn't make sense

153
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:39,660
a.m. so I wrote another letter

154
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,260
but before I a.m. thought okay I have to
do

155
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,309
I have to collect all the proof that
that supports my

156
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,449
my opinion and I was starting to do

157
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,770
and comparison between 22 applications

158
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,510
an I did also start a project

159
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,649
which some what you might be familiar
with my effing printing projects the

160
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:02,929
Recon project for

161
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:06,720
example a shit EP Rican which tries to
identify

162
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,270
webservice I was also creating two
different

163
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,270
project called text Rican called Rican

164
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,520
and toast to pretty much the same but
for for text for written text and fur

165
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,339
coat

166
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:21,870
so died give us you can load coating to
chip the cation

167
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,600
and to application to the fingerprint of
the source code

168
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,309
and determines if there are similarities
but between

169
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,459
or am things that match that

170
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,870
would indicate take a reason and they
are different

171
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,559
approaches to do deaths am but in my
case

172
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,510
it wasn't really helpful because the the
target application Abbas

173
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,600
analyzing was precompiled and I hadn't
had

174
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,929
access to the source code at that moment
am but the plugin stay were

175
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,189
using a were in a separate

176
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,880
file and were accessible refer common
text editor

177
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,939
so I was able to extract all the

178
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:03,959
that the plugin parts that they took
from my project and

179
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:10,040
these are expect the same plugins I was
using

180
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,290
and plagiarism isn't that easy

181
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,170
biko's when a.m. whenever I had to use a
string in my plugins

182
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,660
I use the string ATK because educations
for attack toolkits

183
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,069
and its make sense for me to use the
string ATK in all my plugins

184
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:31,240
the plugins they took from me the hell
hadn't

185
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,579
the chance to change that so 12 plugins
in their product

186
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,170
were naming my project ATK

187
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,020
hmm then one plugin was also mentioning
my website because the test

188
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,829
I was doing the accessing my web server
and it was responsible to find out if

189
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:49,630
the connectivity was given

190
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,470
so even my website what's mentioned in
their product

191
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,699
and whenever I have to use a random
number

192
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:02,209
in coats or or wherever I use my
birthday

193
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:07,209
and the two plugins were mentioning my
birthday in their application

194
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,630
and of course there were some typos in
some some mistake so programming

195
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,300
some programming errors in my plugins
and day to call them

196
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,809
into their product

197
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,360
so I gave them a a lost chance wrote the
third letter

198
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,350
and explains with two examples that I
have proof

199
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,519
them not even sure I think I have
mentioned the fact with the

200
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,860
to educate string ants and at the fact
with my birthday

201
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,420
and said okay hey here is the proof you
count the night that

202
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,500
if your software mentions my birthday
that perhaps you have taken

203
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,670
my coat firm

204
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,949
then they ignore this fact completely
a.m.

205
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,019
instead they offered me to publish a
book

206
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,880
with them S II said no i didnt not
really have an interest to publish a

207
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,459
book issue because

208
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,530
your what you doing is not

209
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,140
really what I like to do about dade took
to time

210
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,650
to try to cover up to think that I
mentioned in my last letter

211
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,400
daily corrected in the new release of
the application so the

212
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,959
new release didn't mention my birthday

213
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,490
28k string the problem was the person
that was correcting those plugins

214
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,089
didn't understand what he was doing and
he bus rendering all the plugin for most

215
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,630
of the plugins use less

216
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,829
because they weren't doing weren't doing

217
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:34,110
the same anymore that they had to do

218
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,990
button very happy now to my part

219
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,069
and it can be little bit less
storytelling but

220
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,179
I will try jazz to give you in overview

221
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,630
on well some legal issues which are

222
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,959
related to the problem market and

223
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,140
problem he was talking about right now
and

224
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,929
it will be rather limited overview I
think we do not

225
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,789
have time to cover everything as you may
imagine and

226
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:05,110
please also note that and but I'm
talking about here

227
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,179
is not really well established in legal
literature in jurisprudence in

228
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:14,480
especially in Switzerland cuz so far
they're just have not been

229
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,650
enough cases to to have that place all
the case law

230
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,740
so don't take everything for granted

231
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,780
and is really depends on on

232
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,059
differs specific case and last

233
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:33,140
preliminary remarkable is that I just
going to speak about Swiss law

234
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,010
and we don't have the time to like to go
beyond based so it will be

235
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,549
focused on on this his perspective

236
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,630
if we go into the subject

237
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,699
an we needs to talk about the protection
of software in general

238
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,789
and in mainly what is a

239
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:56,429
relevance is this with the Copyright Act

240
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,949
and this acted which I have their

241
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:04,549
put the little extract here and
regulates in general the protection of

242
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:05,240
software

243
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,459
under Swiss law at the relevant
provisions in order to determine

244
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,750
whether or not piece of software or
softer entirely is protected by

245
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,970
Copyright Act

246
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,270
is the definition of that term work

247
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,569
which you see here in the article to up
to Swiss Copyright Act

248
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,829
accordingly you need to have their

249
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:29,159
literary an artistic creation of the
mind

250
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,860
the processes individual nature so

251
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,240
you see that this tradition includes two
main features

252
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,589
the first is that you need to have a
creation of the mind

253
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,110
and the second is the individ-
individuality

254
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,500
and having re-establishing what is the
creation of the mind is

255
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,539
well it's a rather easy it means that
you need to have to result

256
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,909
affair human reasoning so a prototype of
fact creating

257
00:15:55,909 --> 00:16:00,640
something done by a human mind this is
to be seen as opposed to

258
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,049
an de mi result for technical process

259
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:08,909
which is not really influenced by human
mind

260
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:12,620
and that second part the individuality
is

261
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,970
less easy well to define what is
generally acknowledged as that is

262
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,539
understood to require an one-sided
leeway you're a room

263
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:26,189
to to create an individual solutions so
if we have jazz

264
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:30,020
one thing all the way which you can
pursue in order to achieve a goal

265
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,159
you don't have the leeway so no
individual creation is possible

266
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,699
and on the other side it's not enough to
have his room

267
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,140
but you also need to have made use if
it's so if you

268
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,880
in spite of having like it my love
possible solutions you just choose the

269
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,150
most obvious and banal one you want
making individual creation

270
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,990
an so yeah if if we have this we see

271
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,350
at that we go forward in the in the
definition

272
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,520
we have there the clear statement that
computer programs will also be deemed

273
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,679
works

274
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,919
and protection is not only granted it's
too

275
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,480
and an entire product bother also to
draft

276
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,529
and part some of an entire work

277
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:18,640
and that maybe with regard to software
for instance

278
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,350
single filer functionality of softer
which may be granted

279
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,740
protection under the Copyright Act as
long as seat

280
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,470
qualifies as work an

281
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,490
and more specifically what may qualify
as working

282
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,779
if we if we go to the mode to the
process of developing software

283
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,850
and at first it may be there

284
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,890
the plan office after a2 concept where
you

285
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,240
at after having made your thoughts you
go

286
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,260
well you take a paper you write down
what you're going to do

287
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,990
you make a concept you may do it
electronically rather than on paper

288
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,429
unknown and but you have to

289
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,490
to produce something already at this
stage there whether it's definitely not

290
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,470
enough is that you just have

291
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,210
an idea in your mind which have you have
not yet

292
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,630
laid down in any tangible for a mighty

293
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,549
and but still you don't have to

294
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,070
well copyright protection is granted
already at their other

295
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,150
released a charity and if we think
courage in this process

296
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,789
and you're going to mile very simplified

297
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,510
speaking that you're going to write your
source code

298
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,570
and there this is definitely the process
where you where you

299
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,580
tried to put your into individual
solution

300
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,440
into air Peace River so there you will
have

301
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,840
most likely work which is protected
under the Copyright Act so we may

302
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,020
conclude that

303
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,100
mostly source code is crowned that
copyright protection

304
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,240
however and

305
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,909
if you have there me your its lines of
source code

306
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:04,380
at there will be on one side you there
will be your your individual solution

307
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,400
what you have really thought about the

308
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,490
but there are also other parts which

309
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,570
the well we lawyers will call it
boilerplate which it is used

310
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,200
and like pre done by someone else

311
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,830
and these parts of the source code then
won't be granted copyright protection

312
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,440
cuz its

313
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,580
I'd it's not your own and work

314
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,210
or it to simply not qualify as a merge
because it's very very standard

315
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,419
and just nothing individual in there

316
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,299
and if you then go further you create

317
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:42,029
the object code and as I understand it

318
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,480
this is generally done not by mo by
yourself

319
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,830
but it's done by means of by User
compilers

320
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,159
and as such as is actually ease that
result

321
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,309
affair in mere technical process

322
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:59,510
so if you think back for that separate
for at there's a question well does it

323
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,190
not qualify as work because it's not the
result of a human

324
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,580
process but and tunics and bed

325
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,990
what you've done this before when riding
down the source code

326
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,130
this is a even if mile physically
produced by

327
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,130
means of compilers it is actually the
result

328
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,529
of the source code so in the end the
half what is granted

329
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:25,580
month copyright protection which is
granted to the source code

330
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,350
to expand that this is found to be again
in the object code

331
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,770
also the object code is granted to
copyright protection

332
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,929
and it may sound a little bit abstract
but

333
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,010
yet and

334
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,960
if we ask ourselves now well
individuality im

335
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,130
very nice but what does it really mean
an

336
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,240
I can say that there has been a rather
recent decision of desert court

337
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,929
appeals at where it was stated that

338
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:00,149
the threshold is rather know so

339
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:03,679
unless you do really have then software
which

340
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,789
experts consider being bunol arm

341
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,020
commonplace ordinary to reveal and

342
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,580
as soon as you go beyond this it will
usually you

343
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,809
be qualified as word and Bess granted

344
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:21,169
be granted copyright protection so we
can conclude that as a matter of

345
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,240
principle

346
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,380
software is generally granted copyright
protection

347
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,600
as long as we do not have exceptionally
but now softer

348
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,280
at hand

349
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,760
an just really quick

350
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,240
a.m. other possible protections we so
far have only spoken about

351
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,440
and copyright protection and there are
questions whether you may

352
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,910
acquire protection by means of patent
law brand

353
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,990
law design law or at the Unfair
Competition Act

354
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,550
an still with regard to the situation in
Switzerland

355
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,050
patton lies mostly not and considered

356
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,480
being able to to grant as sufficient
protection

357
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,790
I see mostly cuz it depends on the way

358
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,160
an invention is defined under Swiss law
which

359
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,590
always requires actually to be to be a
technically invention and

360
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,990
that software which is generated for
instance in order to

361
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,290
Matt reflected a processing

362
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:31,540
banking online banking software does
Rick usually not qualify as

363
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,620
technical invention an brand their
design law

364
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,140
maybe considered but only two very
limited

365
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,850
extend I mean you may protect your day
name of yourself to air

366
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,270
and under brand law but you have to root
which is treated with the

367
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,140
with an institute so as opposed to
copyright protection which is drawn to

368
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,070
its

369
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,820
in the moment to do work has been
created without any further action

370
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,809
required

371
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,480
and brand protection is only granted
once you have registered your brand with

372
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,780
their

373
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,230
with Swiss Institute of intellectual
property

374
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,980
and then we would have the Unfair
Competition Act

375
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,080
Darien I mean it's a it's an act that
regulates n

376
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,280
competition and unfair competition

377
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,520
and you may be made unfair competition
what

378
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,660
marks adversaries have done with the his

379
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,670
tool at so therein is a provision that
states that

380
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,130
if you babe a means of technical

381
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,900
reproduction procedures you copy that
work someone else has created

382
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,170
and Ben use it for your own benefit that
this qualifies as unfair competition

383
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,530
so might think well this is what they
have done

384
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,160
however and it is generally considered
that unfair competition law shall not

385
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,920
grant protect protection in addition to

386
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,110
what's already granted by the Copyright
Act and so

387
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,820
if the in did pat the COPE your I say
the one who takes your work

388
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,990
has to have at least minimal efforts in
order to attend

389
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,170
be able to to benefit from things is
copied

390
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,200
at this is already enough to

391
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,260
not left his probation to apply and

392
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,960
on a case so in his case even though
they

393
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,610
okays blocking state a date took many
things he did

394
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,850
at day packed it in a known piece of
software

395
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,010
at the made marketing efforts

396
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,049
and this will already qualified mess

397
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:37,380
efficient own an efforts

398
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,880
so at rei probably have to conclude that
the only protection which is really

399
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,130
valuable for

400
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,929
mark and similar cases Easter copyright
act

401
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:52,990
yeah back to so

402
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,440
I had contact with different different
lawyers in different countries and asked

403
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,370
him back ten

404
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:03,370
a what their opinion was I had contact
with lawyers in Switzerland in Germany

405
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,059
and India

406
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:08,549
United States and you have to remember
it's it's a few years ago and

407
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,790
General Public License wasn't or or was
not so

408
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,070
so popular back then like today it is
and

409
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,520
as Luca mentioned in the legal world

410
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,290
this kind of problems isn't very popular
still not very popular today

411
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,250
so firm all lawyers told me

412
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,250
back then am I might be right of course

413
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,410
am but a problem is spare day camps

414
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,620
a.m. assured thats arm

415
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,110
the in in Jens I would become the rights
that I deserve

416
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,120
ants am I wouldn't be able to

417
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,160
to a.m. requests

418
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,600
a certain amount of money that the I
would

419
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,130
received from the the company that stole
my coat because

420
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,770
I wasn't able to tell I how much money I
have lost

421
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,600
during this whole case because I was
publishing to softer freely

422
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,770
I hadn't really the damage in my income

423
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,940
am of course s

424
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,170
most with person I have arm legal

425
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,940
insurance but of course my legal
insurance wasn't covering this case

426
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,030
am and it will taft

427
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,309
take me a lot a lot of time in the lot
money to to

428
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:30,610
I'm no gets what they really deserved

429
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,549
so and this wasn't really an option for
me to legal processing so I decided

430
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:39,540
let's have some fun and a.m. I took this
whole adventure

431
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,960
to see how what can I interact with the
media and to how

432
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,280
will this whole situation progress if I
make this

433
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,460
a situation public so I prepared to
Broughton

434
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,600
media offense if am now to see what's
going on

435
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,100
and and in this example the hi sir

436
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,679
online published an article about this
case

437
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,020
and it was pretty interesting I think
most of

438
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,440
people speaking German oh hi sir online

439
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,020
am day have a board the in where people
are able to discuss

440
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,260
the that posting and a.m.

441
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,520
there were around 400 posts am

442
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,150
covering my case ants nearly 390

443
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,470
agreed with me that this case for us was
pretty strange into

444
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,700
them I didn't get what I deserve

445
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,220
and about 10 people were pretty weird
and said I was from

446
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,540
am so I am

447
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,900
while I was preparing to media offense
if and while I was analyzing

448
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,679
the the target software I realized
something very very funny

449
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,360
am or apartment no it was

450
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,980
this was a loose ball the I realized who
the person is that was responsible for

451
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,460
I'm still in my SOC called the problem
is all lawyers told me

452
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,450
I should name the person's name and I
shouldn't named the

453
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,679
to company that stole my coat but I'd
like to show you a little clip

454
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,910
from IT Crowd am some people might know

455
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,080
the CSU's running BBC and

456
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,090
its pretty funny because the name of the
person

457
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,230
is mentioned in this clip hmm

458
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,840
I hope it's loud enough

459
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,790
Peter link for the Firefox engineer ask

460
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,860
what's your email address GOP him I'm
record

461
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,800
to file Peter five-year

462
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,390

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:42,630
purified paid

464
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,619
Peter fide his name is paid

465
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,950
sounds like Peter now aged

466
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,980
Peter paid

467
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,700
has been wrong

468
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,509
it just sounds like paid meet

469
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:06,129
purified paid

470
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:10,259
okay so

471
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:13,279
a.m. you might know the name now am

472
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,249
mmm its surname a very very funny
coincidence

473
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:21,480
I did realize I know this person I know
him for several years

474
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,789
and so I took my time to write on the
maiden

475
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,440
am and explained the whole situation I
wrote him that had contact with the

476
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,149
company

477
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:33,919
he heard that was distributing software
in the mentioned that I know him

478
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,230
and I still had the feeling that this

479
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,649
might be a pain since and it wasn't them

480
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:43,999
the idea to to steal my code and

481
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:48,230
it was just coincidence an and also
mentioned

482
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,409
in the first level i I have received
from the company to set yes sir

483
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:56,460
very ill and he is going to die into I
hope wish him

484
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,859
all the best and yeah I wrote him this
e-mail

485
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:04,080
mmm and I have never received an answer
I hope is not that I

486
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,220
don't know a.m. but

487
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,230
even funnier years earlier

488
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,340
I was discussing with him ever same how
to create

489
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,039
a vulnerability scanner and we were
mailing back and forth

490
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,230
and Big Ten I was creating a tech to
kids and he was creating his software

491
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,330
which which was named use 42

492
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,399
and am he shared his source code with me

493
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,970
so Indy and I had to sew scored of

494
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,830
of the application he was selling I had
the source code to at least the very

495
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,419
early

496
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,279
version of the application width which
took two not very similar

497
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:44,590
from Europe like that the last version
or the version I did an analysis

498
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,059
therefore I wasn't able to to recognize
the k-8 sits in the end it's the same

499
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:49,720
software

500
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,830
but I still own the the code of the
software

501
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,049
and I am still thinking about publishing
discount butter

502
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:59,220
in the quality of softer isn't that good
and I'm

503
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,139
don't think I make anyone something good
but that

504
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:07,429
so am the problem worse firm

505
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:10,730
my media offensive what's going on dance
the

506
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,859
target company wasn't very happy with
the bet

507
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,049
key are they were receiving button so

508
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,230
in in the first place de stopped selling
the software

509
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,759
meant a set date they are going to hire
an expert

510
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,909
which is going to clarify if my I'm

511
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:30,799
statements are true or not am of the
word stay

512
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,499
re released their software and set in
the media out there too I was lying

513
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:36,529
which of course

514
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:40,409
I didn't like very much am still damn

515
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,700
it was interesting to see on older the
board's the people

516
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,859
we're discussing am still most of them
ninety-nine percent

517
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:51,440
were sharing my opinion and the rest was
chairing the opinion

518
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,070
of the opposition which made me very
happy because

519
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,539
in the meanwhile I wasn't even really
sure if I was right or

520
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:02,899
I was just a confused person I'm

521
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:06,340
then am I've heard of the six expert
opinion

522
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,879
they weren't making and II was very
eager to see what what this expert

523
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:16,239
is going to document and I was praying
to got who it would be so funny if I had

524
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,119
access to this expert opinion and

525
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,399
I photo Kate was great if I open my door
at there will be lying this

526
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,820
expert opinion and the next day I will
cop I open my door and it was 92 expert

527
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,759
opinion I don't know who put it there

528
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,480
a.m. I really have no idea but I had
Texas

529
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,619
to this expert opinion on and

530
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,070
I have learnt mom particular thing from
reading this expert a

531
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,519
opinion a.m. which I will share of Torts

532
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,919
ride

533
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,049
and so talking about expert opinions an

534
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:56,299
as we've just heard motherly mark but
also his adversary they both their

535
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:00,049
spend I guess considerable time in order
to write their own

536
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:03,220
expert opinions and let us ask is

537
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,289
wouldn't this be of any use if it then
came to a

538
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:09,339
court proceeding and related

539
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:12,490
the question how does a cord is that
this weather violation of your copyright

540
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,240
has appeared on up

541
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,820
an generally yes a court

542
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,970
we'll and will have to rely on their

543
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,990
on an expert opinion however what

544
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,139
the court docs is that it does not rely
on their

545
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:31,049
well on that so-called expert opinion
are on the real expert opinion

546
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:34,730
moment of the parties has done but it
will mom

547
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,309
ordered to be done there won by a
neutral expert

548
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:42,490
which will be court appointed to the
court will the side with the

549
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,919
based but probably based on the party's
input

550
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,349
and decide on an on a neutral
third-party expert

551
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:54,109
and this guy will Ben and provide his
expert based on

552
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:58,399
specific questions which will be asked
by the court

553
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,830
an as potential claimants are a
defendant and such a proceeding you

554
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,319
may want to know that such expert
opinion may

555
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:14,460
cost a bit and its will usually be there
party not prevailing in the procedure

556
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,679
with then in the end going to pay for
days expert opinion sorry

557
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,710
if well if if the case is really
complicated

558
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,720
it may also be pretty expensive 10

559
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,799
this is what you have pointed that
before correctly

560
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:32,099
and private expert opinion

561
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,440
well I call the private I mean the one
he has done are at the other party has

562
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,290
done

563
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,970
at it's not that the cord 13 did but it
will be considered as mean mere

564
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,940
party pleading so its does not have the
value of

565
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,839
real evidence and but it's just what

566
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:52,470
he says as party and as parties
obviously now

567
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,190
you chill so it won't affect the value
of a real

568
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,540
expert opinion even though it may be
better than their

569
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,579
21 ordered by the court but that's just
sad remark

570
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:07,029
an what will the experts analyze you
will

571
00:35:07,029 --> 00:35:10,400
generally look at all elements of
software which

572
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,630
are granted its copyright protection so
as we've seen before he will

573
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,059
public first look at their that the
concept of software

574
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:22,329
and how things are organized how wall
the architecture is done

575
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:26,970
I mean by architecture mean how out
there the software works not technically

576
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,359
but

577
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,490
rather on conception or bases an

578
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,319
but then in addition he will also look
at the source code

579
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:37,520
and at the object code am

580
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,170
and you may noticed that in order to do
so

581
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,710
you will have to draft guidance and this
is probably the most important thing

582
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:51,770
you can just go to court and claim well
my the softer has been stolen them

583
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,970
der der iz diz other software and it's
identical

584
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,730
but you have to provide the court with
very specific guidance

585
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:02,710
am probably as he did saying that well
here we have

586
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,619
his lineup source code we have that we
have this so that that cord

587
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:10,920
is then able to say to the expert what
the is going to

588
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,170
what he has to analyze an

589
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,609
and really them mere description of
software

590
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:21,690
if you simply stayed well myself
terrarium may be used in order to

591
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,559
to do isn't bad that won't be enough for
and then the court will just simply

592
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,020
dismiss your claim

593
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,609
saying well you don't have specified
what really you claim is

594
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:34,010
done wrong in the case at hand

595
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,299
in so a

596
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:42,109
I didn't realize one thing because the
expert opinion that

597
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:45,160
I was able to to Reid's and the

598
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,309
this is the fact that not everyone is an
expert

599
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:52,220
the well there was a lot a funny typos

600
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,869
in the expert opinion of deal the
company

601
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:59,190
a que he might not be an expert in his
language

602
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:04,520
am what was with really strange was that
he was comparing the compiled versions

603
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,450
of the software

604
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,309
but my claim was that they were using
source code

605
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:13,380
and my application was open source so
they had access to my source code

606
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,779
and to stay but a company that was
distributing the software and I hope

607
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:17,589
they had

608
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:21,460
excess food source code to therefore it
would have been possible to do a source

609
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,279
code analysis

610
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:26,779
analysis button then air bubbles

611
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:30,339
a much fun your boss that experts
claimed

612
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:33,430
did I have lost all my rights

613
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,660
of my software because I have published
it

614
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,560
as open source and thats pretty strange
isn't it

615
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,410
it doesn't really make sense an

616
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,930
and what was even funnier he claimed
that the

617
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,329
380 plugins they have stolen Dave stone
all

618
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:55,750
plugins 380 air it must have been an
accident

619
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,400
and it might be just a coincidence okay
there were

620
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,960
they were testing for the same 300
eighty woman abilities

621
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,799
they were you using the same X attack
vectors the same

622
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,290
exploits the same payloads and for 300

623
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,250
eighty exploit plugins and it might just
be a coincidence

624
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,460
I don't know I I don't really believe in
that

625
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,470
and in it was pretty strange because the
expert was sorta only

626
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,480
am quoting because PDR

627
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,119
and yeah I don't know if if we keep Edo
State the right source

628
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,290
to be quoted in a legal case

629
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,410
in

630
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,980
catchers one and going back one slide
just wanna remark to

631
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,049
and the statement that he has lost all
rights amino

632
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:48,079
I want I I come back to this

633
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,990
now later bed at just happened and
appear

634
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,240
190 orphan expert opinion should be i
mean as

635
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,859
generally an expert will only make
factual statement

636
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,049
so he will never have to happen

637
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:06,490
mile 22 legally chuch a case and what he
said here that he lost all rights is

638
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,299
definitely a legal statement

639
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:14,060
so add this is actually not the experts
businessman

640
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,130
and going bit further an

641
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:23,140
do mild 22 really they're like that the
core of the case let's call it like this

642
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,609
and what protection is then granted by
the Copyright Act so if we have

643
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:29,829
established that the software the hand

644
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:34,490
and is an individual individual creation
up the human mind so qualifies a

645
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,089
work but what the city's might bring
then

646
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:41,740
and generally at the author

647
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,920
has the exclusive rights to own his work
yes the right to it recognition

648
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,310
to back of his ownership and of his

649
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:55,670
authorship which includes the ride to
always be acknowledged as

650
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,319
of their when the software is published
her used or

651
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,829
distributed whatever but furthermore he
has also the right to decide whether

652
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:07,310
when and how his work may be published

653
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,319
and whether when and how it may be used

654
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:14,790
an this is now generally speaking

655
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:20,259
based on the Copyright Act will does it
does apply to open source software

656
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:23,390
so the statement the Hindi expert made

657
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,609
pursuant to which you lose your
copyrights want to publish to source

658
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:28,599
code is definitely wrong

659
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,319
an but it does not apply to self-care

660
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:37,000
and license under the GPL but I will
talk about this

661
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,730
just in a minute and if we talk about
softer which is protected by the

662
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,259
copyright actor without GPL

663
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:48,690
and their authors a ride to recognition
of his authorship

664
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,790
is then the key to defend against after
play a key reason because usually

665
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,970
if third-party takes years after steals
it

666
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,670
and published said he wants a well marc
has written it

667
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,099
so his basic rights to be acknowledged
as author

668
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:08,099
is definitely while aidid and as such

669
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,490
mom yeah each other one snap doing what
it should

670
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,730
little an as I said

671
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,410
Justin the mere fact that you publish
source code

672
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,910
does not change anything in this regard
to would have just said is equally valid

673
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,690
to in which regard to provide

674
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:30,230
proprietary software as well as to open
source software

675
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,359
no were too far an

676
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:39,559
particularities with regard to the
General Public License

677
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,910
and there are many so

678
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,349
talking to to some people in my office
talk im

679
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:49,710
telling them about this case and

680
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,930
and then I at a certain point and say
well mark published as after and the GPL

681
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,059
and you know being I business lawyers
that has said

682
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,520
hopewell is crazy and bed

683
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,529
of course you my most likely
contradicted a statement

684
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:08,089
at it's just to illustrate that when you
publish software

685
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:11,630
using GPL you're definitely on other
grounds

686
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,200
then you will be if you would just
publish it undead

687
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,779
I say normal copyright protection and

688
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:24,319
the first question is how to include the
license when you distribute after

689
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,579
the license and and GPL is a license

690
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:31,540
is in agreement so you can't really
impose it on your counter party

691
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,529
an your counterpart he has to agree to
use this License as contractual basis

692
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:41,549
for his use of the software now this
sounds very sophisticated

693
00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:45,290
at you don't have to to sit together at
down in agreement

694
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,410
but what Nick wood my butt is required

695
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,079
is dead in the moment day user

696
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,990
well gets per session or starts using
the software

697
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,180
he needs to know that you do only
distributed

698
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,980
on basis of the GPL and he then needs to
somehow

699
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,640
well give his approval to using it under
this License and disease usually

700
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,559
done then by you have a.m. well pop up
for it said it states well

701
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,599
you have to accept the license and this
is dead most important

702
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:20,380
point to how to include softer after
reading the documentation

703
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,150
mark has provided me with that is
scanned the party claim

704
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,420
that well and we didn't even know that
it was GPL

705
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,500
so I mean this will be potentially a
valid statement they would make their

706
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,790
case better but

707
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,520
there is a risk that if you ride
somewhere wherein

708
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,440
the user us after has just no chance to
to see that it's GPL

709
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,020
teachers comp validly give his approval
to the use of this License

710
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,759
an now to the right over will skip
rights and obligations

711
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:54,990
licensor cuz its serum very much related
to the rights and obligations after

712
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,579
licensee obviously at let's have a look
at you right up there

713
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,559
licensee most importantly especially as
opposed to do

714
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,990
protection granted on the Copyright Act
he has the right to

715
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,930
copy and modify the source code and the
object code

716
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,970
and this is a very general statement
there are then

717
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,170
legal scholars who argue that well if
their

718
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,049
own the person modifying softer that'd
so poorly

719
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:23,170
that in your well you're own

720
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,440
integrity and their reputation would be
damaged if it was not modified in in

721
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,119
such way that this would then wrap

722
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,109
violate the authors personality rights
so

723
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:38,210
you can modified but potentially not to

724
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,329
very very very poorly but you are
granted a little

725
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:47,029
a little protection in addition the
licensees for is allowed to distribute

726
00:44:47,029 --> 00:44:48,529
after

727
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:51,940
and beat physically or online

728
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,799
the latter is disputed but I think that

729
00:44:55,799 --> 00:45:00,400
also online distribution is includes
specially if the author of the

730
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,630
GPL software and publishes it online as
well

731
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,099
he has not only rights but is also
publications

732
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,400
an he must of course open source

733
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,240
make it available not only the uptick
coat but he must also make available the

734
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,520
source code

735
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,990
if it distributes your software and he
must their

736
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:25,220
included except the GPL there at least a
reference where these

737
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,619
easy to get and he may not charge a

738
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:33,250
royalty for distributing the software so
he may not

739
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,779
mom try to TV fair

740
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:40,470
licensee what he may however is dead
iffy

741
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,380
distributes the software on a CD for
instance he may charge for did

742
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,980
physical CD wealthy may sell dat CD but
not

743
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,420
royalties for whether it's on there

744
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,930
an and most importantly probably the
so-called copyleft affect if which

745
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm sure you have heard is that the
modified softer made n

746
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,310
only be distributed again under GPL

747
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,410
and in this regard to the palace
considered as from

748
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:12,270
let's say that that the most their rigid
lies in so you really really have to

749
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,020
publish whatever you have

750
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,619
use if you use some GPL based software

751
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:23,580
in your own software you then have to
publish it under GPL again

752
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,339
problem not if parts you use aren't like

753
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:30,869
really a separate part but

754
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:35,569
and so what we see is that licensee on
the TPL has far more rights than he

755
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:36,730
would have

756
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,989
just based on normal copyright
protection

757
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:43,609
and in this regard interesting to know
is that

758
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:46,690
the GPL contains a provision according
to which

759
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,099
as soon as the licensee violates the
license

760
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,890
so for instance if he published in at
your GPL software

761
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,619
without publishing the source code he
violates the license

762
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:02,609
and this is under the license the to
auto terminate the license

763
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:06,219
so it will end he will be back on their
copyright

764
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:11,040
active protection and he will have far
less rights than he had before

765
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,660
am so yeah

766
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,250
what you might have done an

767
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,940
I mean with regard to the inclusion of
GPL it's what I've just said so if you

768
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,420
wish to include you need to make sure
that your

769
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,190
licensee really has to agree to use this
License you

770
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,049
don't hide it that for the way didn't so
that no one can see it

771
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:38,290
an but more practically

772
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,520
I suggest you act quickly its the

773
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,819
especially if you intend to have accords
to

774
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:49,150
I mean if if you really wanna do
something you may consider asking the

775
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,150
courts to

776
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,250
and issue pretty preliminary injunction
which will then

777
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,060
with immediate effect and prevent your

778
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,940
counterparty from for the publishing the
software you claim he

779
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,779
has stolen but in order to do so you
need to act quickly I mean you can't

780
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:11,609
it doesn't mean that you Kong exchange
letters and tried to into region out of

781
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:13,750
court settlement beforehand

782
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,670
at but you shouldn't wait I tell you
shouldn't break month

783
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:23,400
so and then act well I say act
decisively act firmly

784
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,630
and usually especially if you have a
like him

785
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:31,359
big firm on the other side and if you
just write them a nice letter they will

786
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:31,759
say

787
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:35,080
yeah as they have done with you nothing
with and Welton

788
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,980
it's all nice at home but it's just not
true so you

789
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,029
have to have a certain decisiveness in
writing your letter

790
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:48,489
which of course that mean doesn't mean
that you should there threaten them more

791
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:51,980
yeah just people careful but for and
decisive

792
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,739
and probably most important also is that
that you safeguard

793
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:59,940
evidence as Marcus at day after

794
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,369
confronting them with their examples

795
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:07,779
where do you see that they have copied
or may have copied software

796
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:11,089
are part of his code at they certain

797
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:14,670
but they immediately started changing it
to before

798
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:17,810
giving them what you think proves

799
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:22,750
your case and you should make sure that
you have everything on five

800
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,819
not that he day after you go and have a
look and wall

801
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:29,109
nothing there anymore and

802
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:34,390
in addition to whether said you may act
considered criminal prosecution

803
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,819
cuz there most acts violating the

804
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:41,819
are most some conduct violating their
Copyright Act

805
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:46,549
there's also qualify as criminal offence
and this may help you especially in

806
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:48,430
cases where you are afraid of

807
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:54,299
as starting a civil procedure having to
prove everything having a big race go

808
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:58,009
to bear costing the and bear you need a
lawyer

809
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:02,940
so sometimes it helps if you just go to
the to please her today

810
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,170
criminal prosecution and claim that
there has been a violation of the

811
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,069
Copyright Act

812
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:13,359
and ten-day should actually start to
investigate and also to to safeguard

813
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,219
proofs and

814
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,259
gain evidence at one more

815
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:22,119
remark and mark has set that lawyers
told him that

816
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,200
because it gave the softer away for free
he doesn't really have lost profits

817
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,540
that this is true but there is also the
possibility

818
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,560
dead if you have softer which is used

819
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,339
copyright protection and that it is used
by a third-party for

820
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:41,599
who sells the softer there is also the
possibility that you tried to

821
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,369
claim what day gained using your
copyright

822
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:50,619
your copyright so this is usually did
that the most at home

823
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:53,670
most and promising way forward

824
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:57,250
I think

825
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:01,020
so a we're running a bit of time good
just one thing

826
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,219
a.m. while I was analyzing the software
I have realized it has a lot

827
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:10,430
of security issues and them I won't go
into details but the quality of the

828
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,140
software was

829
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,829
pretty poor and it was even possible to
owned a scanner

830
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:17,829
remotely so we're I wouldn't

831
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:20,890
have spent money for the software I am

832
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:25,700
my quick summary a legal prosecution is
not easy especially if you're not a

833
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,869
specialist or have

834
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:30,420
access to a specialist am as

835
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,849
lucas et act quickly and take a good
lawyer yes my weapon of choice

836
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:38,770
and you have the possibility to learn
from my fails

837
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:41,989
I hope this is useful am then

838
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:45,150
licensees and copyrights are the same
and

839
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:49,119
to fight for your right as long as you I
think you are

840
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,579
right and the case is well documented

841
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,299
this is my last time I will discussed
this case

842
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:59,859
it's it's close for me into it doesn't
make sense for me to to ship

843
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:04,140
discuss it any further you for half
interests to take a deeper look into

844
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,730
Indian to my analysis

845
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:12,730
you free I'm I don't know if you have
time for questions

846
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:24,130
well I mean generally there is a risk
that if you waited too long

847
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:27,350
the court will just say well now you

848
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,640
you've tolerated it you have agreed to
them using yourself to air

849
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,950
and they would just say well okay now
it's too late

850
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:40,010
this is generally speaking but more
specifically if you tried to chew haden

851
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,110
if you want to ask the court to act
immediately especially for instance

852
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:44,760
without

853
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,530
talking first to the counterparty what
you need is

854
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:51,740
you need to have their and urgent case

855
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,410
and if you wait too long your cases just
not

856
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:58,720
virgin anymore you can't go to court and
say well

857
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,940
you now need to issue this injunction
today

858
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,510
don't talk to the counterparty three
Levi we need to Harry

859
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:09,130
and then they see well you first noticed
this

860
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,340
a six month ago then you did nothing for
two months you talk to them for four

861
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,720
months so

862
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,030
its just be one be virgin anymore but

863
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,750
there is no need to rush you always have
time to think about what you're doing so

864
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,830
just don't wait too long any further
questions

865
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:35,010
this is a very good question

866
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,360
when I was preparing the presentation I
was going to the website

867
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,170
to their online shop and that there's
lots of tourists still

868
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:46,300
announced their and if it on and there's
still a link to download the trial

869
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,890
version

870
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,610
if you click on the link there comes a
message with spare which tests

871
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,780
the softer isn't available anymore but
it still in the online

872
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,210
and whatsoever so I contacted them and
ask

873
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:01,220
hey I'm preparing a naval aviation

874
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:05,420
of securities get disk please send me a
current version of the software

875
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:10,010
and the the woman on the phone told me
that they aren't selling the softer at

876
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:10,620
the moment

877
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,700
but the problem was I was a.m. saying I
was more proof

878
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,240
and I'm not sure if they realized who I
was and if this was just the answer

879
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,410
that plus prepared for my person

880
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:29,410
so I don't really know anyone else

881
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,710
revenge for my ear

882
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,730
appearance in the media or

883
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,510
or on know it to dis is my little
revenge into

884
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,510
yeah it was fun and I hope it was fun
for you too

885
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:48,250
butter in Jen's no one really cares when

886
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,310
it is it's

887
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:56,550
so thank you very much for your time and
I hope it was a bit

888
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,090
entertainment
