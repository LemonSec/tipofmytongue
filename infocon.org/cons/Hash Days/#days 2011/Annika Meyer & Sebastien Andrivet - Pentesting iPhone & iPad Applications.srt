1
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,180
welcome to this presentation

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:22,180
we are going to talk about been 15 a US
a petition

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,929
my name is Annie Kammerer and this is
Sebastian River

4
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:29,480
we are both cofounder serve eighty

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,739
to which combines

6
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,519
based in Geneva and

7
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:44,519
especially the information security

8
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,780
so this is the agenda we are going to
stop me some more reviews

9
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,370
and then some previous researches on
that subject and then

10
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:05,370
your chip in person and finish with a
live demonstration

11
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,799
so they are three types of by US a
petition

12
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,869
they are web applications

13
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,340
not keep applications and the hybrid
application

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,320
such as monitor yes and we are going to
fuck you soon

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,299
nazis application today Nazi occupation
are written in

16
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,530
objective-c which is the

17
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,929
and optionally with some C or C++ les
plus

18
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:41,770
and they are combined into a ram

19
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,159
keep you called which is quite different
from

20
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,159
Intel x86 cool

21
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,090
so

22
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,280
I US reputation are distributed as I P

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,950
buys which are simply fights and then

24
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,910
deployed in appt directory which is the
same

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,810
Mike or six other one thing which is
important is that

26
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,220
the executable are always encryptor

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,440
a even for free application

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,800
with something similar to Fairplay which
is using

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,810
a yes and all application of fine by

30
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,660
Apple so to the application

31
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,800
the you have to the crypt it before

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,310
and the usually we decreed it manually
with the

33
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,780
gdb which is the glue the burger and the

34
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,780
for chris is also a solution faster when
it works

35
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,220
so as I said before objective-c agency

36
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,290
for is a is a mix between

37
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,569
the C language in Smalltalk and version

38
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,690
to objective she was released by Apple

39
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,190
a with the you print

40
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,709
objective sees a superset the BSE and

41
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:27,709
it can also mixed with the steepest us

42
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,930
about reverse engineering so what you
will see that it's

43
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,750
it's not so abuse at first specially if
you never worked with the

44
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,120
your am before a

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
its as I said before completely
different from Intel x86 CPU

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,540
code and the objective-c

47
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,440
is also very particular because when you
call a method of an object when you send

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,290
the message

49
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,730
in Smalltalk an objective-c terminology

50
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,220
you always you always make an indirect
core

51
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,870
in fact to call her Miss since then
function and best the name of the

52
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,590
message

53
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,590
by Ricky in the register of the CPU you
can find some scripts and tools about to

54
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,460
reverse engineering com on the internet
but some they're often out of date then

55
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:33,480
not working and the best tool available
today

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,480
is idea pro

57
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,750
about that the storage there are

58
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,890
the different mechanism in the US
supplication

59
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,460
the first one list isn't very used and

60
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,470
even sometimes I use we will see that
later in the month demonstration

61
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,960
its the in binary or each the men

62
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,690
and for more complex that the you have
sq like

63
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,010
3 and the secrets and

64
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,850
us more are normally stored in two key
chain a storage mickens

65
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,240
but is supposed to be secure but it can
also sometimes be cracked

66
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,060
and of course application can also use
their own binary formats

67
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,060
but even disc is Dr often based on
property

68
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,370
what's very important is that we're as a
user of

69
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,610
iPhone or iPad by default the backups

70
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,919
are nuts uncluttered so it is possible
to extract many data from the backups

71
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,800
so we still we strongly recommend to
change the default encrypt the backup in

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,790
this case you have to set the password

73
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,830
it's not 100 percent secure but it's
better than nothing

74
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,510
so now

75
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,470
I was sure you some previous researches
on the subject but you can

76
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,229
find one he internet so a police
releasing the

77
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,919
major version every year of IOUs some
good things are becoming

78
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,919
obsolete very fast so this document from

79
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,780
found stone seems promising butts

80
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,960
in VN its what is super d it's quite
disappointed because it assumes a lot

81
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,130
it does she was not yet you have the
source code of the application

82
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,270
to Ben best and if you have the source
code is always better to do a code

83
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:50,270
review instead of a pin test

84
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,240
this one is so wat paper from Nicolas
Serre you

85
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,920
written 9 2010 for black had issued by
its

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,130
not exactly on the same subject but it's
an excellent source of information about

87
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,980
that that the stored in the

88
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,640
in iPhones whoever it's now a little bit
out-of-date

89
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,110
this one is from tipping point

90
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,730
quite interesting because we use it does
a starting point to take with the

91
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,620
petition

92
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,190
butts it was written in 2009

93
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:34,190
so it's quite out-of-date now and those
two are quite different from the bill

94
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,580
refuse one because their goalies to
teach supplication cracking

95
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,770
so broke but the SAR

96
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,840
upset as well because written in 2008
and 2009

97
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,710
and but it's quite interesting for
reverse engineering

98
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,400
so as you say to summarize there are
lots of documents

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,430
available on the web butts almost both

100
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,660
overlooked them already out-of-date and
not

101
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,950
with realistic unusable and this is one
of the reason we are here today

102
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,770
some so now we bill

103
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,130
actually see how our methodology

104
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,260
so hero some steps

105
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,620
we will detailed them the first that is
the

106
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,560
preparing the device so

107
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,900
it's better to have the day to devise
than your own

108
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,540
iPhone or iPad Gaza then

109
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,500
you you you you can have security risk
if you

110
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,470
if you use your own the device so you
have to decide then if you want to

111
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,410
jailbreak your device or not

112
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,630
J breaking his user and exploits to get
full access to the device

113
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,010
pets its will be done by up only sure or
register

114
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,100
the up in the Ripper butts

115
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,000
sometimes it's more than three if you
want to install some tools on the rise

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,590
to jailbreak it

117
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,790
so but don't do this again if you if you
have

118
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,970
computer so that they are on your device
because jailbreaking disable a lot of

119
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,360
security feature

120
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,400
put in place by a pole and then you can
be attacked

121
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,850
so these are some

122
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,880
useful tools I will not detain them here
but some

123
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,290
something we didn't see you in the demo

124
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,360
or some of them are very useful to make
your GPS

125
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,950
as I said before new the bigger up this
open this message is required to get a

126
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,940
remote Sen

127
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,560
and we will use this in the
demonstration

128
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,210
and Sebastian also which sure you were
demonstration with just be done

129
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,610
so

130
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,630
something which is quite important they
are

131
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,680
on every iPhone or iPad they are to
users through to know bank and they all

132
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:15,980
are

133
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,530
have the same password which which is
well known which is

134
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,690
Alpine so make sure

135
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,190
when you when you do been testing the to
change does especially if you jailbreak

136
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,070
you device or issue use open this
message

137
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,340
was otherwise you can get that

138
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,310
course so next step be set up

139
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,670
the workstation Windows is OK

140
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,550
and it will be the case in those that in
this demonstration we

141
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,070
we have a mac book but it runs a Windows
seven but if you have those choice Mike

142
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,290
or six is better because it's very
similar to our US

143
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,360
if you want to use a

144
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,330
Linux or BSD good luck him

145
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,180
it's possible but since some tools are
only available on Windows and Mac OS X

146
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,180
some more tools that we will use during
the demonstration no

147
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,830
will not go through through them here

148
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,839
and then we have one soon

149
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,570
or own tombs but they are not specific
to iPhone or iPad

150
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,740
but so useful to bent this to you %uh
supplications

151
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,740
we wouldn't see them during the
demonstration little

152
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,490
so the next step is setting up the
network each

153
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,920
this is what we use to to do when

154
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,080
when we contests so we have the

155
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,620
%uh we connects your iPhone by wifi

156
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,850
witness a bridge loan and the we

157
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,870
is a great deal on though the way fight
with the firework

158
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:09,580
because we don't trust wifi

159
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,750
State Forest your actual been testing so

160
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,750
there are steps in the stepson so first
you install the application from iTunes

161
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,240
and then you have the perceive pen-based
switches

162
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,520
called organ this once %uh where you can
do

163
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,200
even more subscribe and the steps see is

164
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,990
active I we did focus here on this that
be ok with the source

165
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,990
and also for the demonstration

166
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,330
network capture it's possible to run to
sit

167
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,610
dump on the iPhone and then transferred
arisen

168
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,459
but his ascent I to the workstation

169
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,270
and open the file with whale shark for
example butts

170
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,190
this is not very convenient because you
don't get real time data

171
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,530
so with the fry its author so we prefer
to see the network packets in real time

172
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,650
ans to do this we connect just be done

173
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,709
on the reform with when they're short
I'm no

174
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,300
we use netcat nudist and win this pipes

175
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,500
and our own twin cities like to buy and
we would see that little in the

176
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,180
demonstration

177
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,709
he can also use the the proximate third
them

178
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,770
and the the most simple is to set the
proxy

179
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,670
on the iPhone settings

180
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,140
and down the workstation you can use
burp or

181
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:53,140
web scarab for example and then there's
a another proxy method

182
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,959
%uh for example if the first method is
not working because the

183
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:05,440
man some a petition they knew all the
proxy settings or are they communicate

184
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,589
on on Sunday reports or

185
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,450
use non standard protocol and then we
created our own

186
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,320
interception tools which is cool even
interceptor

187
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,000
sorry didn't like a transparent proxy
instead of

188
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,209
configuring the proxy settings as before

189
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:28,870
on the phone you changed your AP of the
DNS to point to a DVD intercept or N

190
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,200
eat we do in ther said yes request
create this is sensor to fit it on the

191
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,990
fly

192
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,280
an instant which to keep me in HTTPS

193
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,280
can also be just got into purple webcam

194
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,529
so in order to intercept assistant
traffic

195
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,670
a we make a classical many in the meal
attack

196
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:05,490
will submit your lists application
verify the validity of certificates so

197
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,110
we have to inject the root certificates
into the device

198
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,970
you can see that on the screen when they
left

199
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,370
and the was so this is quite simple to
do with it

200
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,670
tour by up home which is called iPhone
Configuration Utility

201
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,259
despite ban him it's also available in a
bad then

202
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,009
I but thats it's not

203
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,040
abuse because certificate or colder
Crandon

204
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,190
credentials seems to and now

205
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,389
I we'll it's the best time explain to
you the

206
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,860
the configuration of the network will
protest demonstration

207
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,899
don't do him in death

208
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,399
a kid for before the demonstration
lowell

209
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,050
explain a little bit the setup

210
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,100
I have no small device its first three
digits connected both rigid

211
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,779
to us his cum and it's also a WiFi
network

212
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:04,990
were tryouts but and I will

213
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,399
and connect this is an iPod Touch it's
not an iPhone but

214
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,920
for this demonstration it the senator
and i connect

215
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,019
this I but touch to with WiFi network

216
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,769
and my computer yeah I'm

217
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,990
I will use Windows seven for the
demonstration because

218
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,480
I will use some towards which I'll at

219
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,519
I have on the 19 cents for example I

220
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,250
the pro I don't have the most sense for
I'm Windows and Macintosh so

221
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,529
I have to choose windows for that reason
and underarm

222
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:44,279
device i install a VNC server which is
called the vinson

223
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,800
and miss with it we will be able to see
the screen

224
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,610
I've the phone on the iPod Touch
enormous through time

225
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,910
and they're so I install administer such
tell the open is a search

226
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,689
so we have a remote shell I will use it

227
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:05,179
also for home two times for fines

228
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,189
and that would start with my first demo
so you see

229
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,540
on the left the screen of my form

230
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,620
I would say my phone tonight but better

231
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,770
from they from so it's not very fast

232
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,600
because the splints is not very first
but for the most special mission to

233
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,140
Turkey

234
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,390
and I winced dealt with the

235
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,690
the first a petition which is called
post-world memory

236
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,880
it's on a petition the security
application used to

237
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,280
hide some secrets to encrypt some
secrets

238
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,650
and the other pincode I will try

239
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:51,400
a pin I confirm

240
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,620
and

241
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,049
its inverted and I would try to find

242
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,260
this pin code I will try to help keep

243
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,350
this application the first thing to do

244
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,659
this to find the application you're in
ninth

245
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:13,840
in I have a remote shell and the first
think this to

246
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,549
find where is a publication well
applications

247
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,650
I'll on those amo by account in a

248
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,880
directory which is called applications
and like

249
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,340
and the cats that the owner the PP

250
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:36,080
director in services

251
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,860
mind application it in fact in a
subdirectory reserve random name

252
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,580
and just have to remember with name and
that will go

253
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,610
with mississippi directly under fire
since then

254
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,360
on the phone so again var props I can

255
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,900
magnify went okay do you read yes

256
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,580
so involved Mumbai around

257
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,690
you know it is applications

258
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,100
and and result the

259
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,010
fives above the a petition and if I'm
going to label really preferences

260
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,179
I have a proper to lift so user
preferences

261
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,549
I will transfer over spine on my
computer

262
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:25,640
to look at it this is the FIDE

263
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,040
double-click and effect mean if a little
bit

264
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,590
you see data up into the

265
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,640
and Gordon boers 16 or issue

266
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,220
decode approach it its million cryptid

267
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,929
but if we go at the end

268
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,669
you see this its look like a pin code

269
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:03,669
so let's try with

270
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:14,550
seventh heaven 7 7

271
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,400
this is a pin code the third very

272
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,860
classical example of what we found when
we been pissed

273
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,190
US applications secrets are not

274
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,440
told securities of told in plain text

275
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,780
they met encryptions but so developer
forget

276
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,060
to encrypt so pincode so it's completely
useless of course unit 12 in

277
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,630
Nexus to this fine but so the point is
that the

278
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,850
the bus or does not encrypt up the left
demonstration

279
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,990
is is not an attack yesterday just to
show you our two

280
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,410
kept true data turn the truck traffic in
real time

281
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:03,410
I feel that they will use LinkedIn so
I'm going back

282
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,130
yeah I will

283
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,510
a daughter before your in this case is
because I'm directly connecting

284
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,540
my laptop to use the WiFi network but if

285
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,920
you have a UNM the firewall it's not
possible

286
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,440
to communicate directly from I'll put

287
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,610
to the workstation without opening a

288
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,040
abort so what we do because we don't
like to open

289
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,930
abort from away from the truck 20 lung

290
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,220
so what we do is we use is a search

291
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,850
and we make a remote turn on I i've

292
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,720
already chewed tuners one which is for

293
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,470
this demonstration and one which is for
the

294
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,760
next time so instead of connecting
directly

295
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,150
from the iPod to among my workstation
with the IP address of my workstation

296
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,630
we look so look I will use that look
back address

297
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,030
on on the phone so

298
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,360
what they want to to do this to stop the
two should be done

299
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,770
and to see the result in while shocking
I am

300
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,540
whale shark somewhere yeah and

301
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,690
under Windows only you can the mmm

302
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,540
you something which is special you can
capture a internet

303
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,540
it on a day to from Windows by

304
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,660
but you need something to connect to
sleep you dump

305
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,000
to with this for Windows pipe and that's
why we use

306
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,970
our own tool added the stock to buy you
up some

307
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,930
by metals you have to choose a name for
the pipe for example shark

308
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,440
oh hush much these Ashton

309
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,520
and the port but to see people

310
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,190
and I chose sick sick sick sick and now
I will connect while you're shocked

311
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,460
to his tour its

312
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,200
simple the syntax is a little bit odd
because

313
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,640
it's a bit Windows by and virtues I wish
there is

314
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,300
so so backpacks backlash the point is
for the local

315
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,840
station by the father by name

316
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,410
by its namespace and the name of the
pipe and

317
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,860
if I go back yeah I see at the end yeah

318
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,530
so it's connected and now I'm going

319
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,080
to riches

320
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,250
to my remote churner and then we do
we're

321
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,350
to sleep with them I will explain

322
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:56,350
the parliament wells just have to type
them

323
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,510
the Phils palmetto is to avoid resolving
millions of this kind of thing we want

324
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,330
we

325
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,760
you wanted to only the report that's
minnows

326
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,820
is me 0 is to capture the war but that
not just the beginning

327
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,240
the world means the infinite this case

328
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,090
mean issue it's important because
otherwise

329
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,340
up this a bit them for you but for so
the capture

330
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,580
so we its it's not what we want to do we

331
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,770
want to see this in real time this is
too

332
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,140
output so to so-so packets

333
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,370
on so

334
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,590
my father output and synth

335
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,980
I'm doing a demo stationing and
connecting ready to

336
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,140
unconnected to his iPod with the

337
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,840
I'm SSH VNC and aretha

338
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,140
this book arm I want to avoid

339
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,890
doctoring despite its and I'm by putting
this

340
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,520
Res netcat so

341
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,990
this is the loopback address but

342
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,210
it's in fact on 29 and it would grow
direct

343
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,990
this on my workstation and Norman

344
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:25,640
if I go back yeah to suppose to work

345
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,660
we would try so I'm going back

346
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:35,660
in mind former

347
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,960
and I will stop LinkedIn

348
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:52,620
it's not working

349
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,570
process I would connect directly both

350
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:14,570
small simple have to stop or

351
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I'm to get my IP address

352
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,200
it's 100%

353
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,480
archer a restaurant

354
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm going into one of shock

355
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,710
it's not posted

356
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,020
IQ thank you I'm

357
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,300
and much but

358
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,620
market and then going back to

359
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,430
yeah but this time I will

360
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,260
connect directly in 10

361
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:20,260
and no its not connect

362
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:52,359
moment

363
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,830
I came I'm Manitoba chilton time no

364
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,940
real 20 minutes ok it's okay

365
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,940
so I would retry again

366
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,179
a point of being yeah

367
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:22,080
are there for receive the connection
okay so I think between mark

368
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,240
at yes i'm too nervous

369
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,830
have to be more two-minute make this
more slowly

370
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,170
so I have to restart everything

371
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:40,170
K again

372
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,400
I Irish

373
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,010
things

374
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,350
RK

375
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:57,350
this is connected and

376
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,880
and the five top din

377
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:24,560
on something's wrong

378
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,760
but through the hood this time and I'm
not using the tone or it's working

379
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,790
aren't just sent a bit slow I will

380
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:40,790
just display the as to 2 p.m. yes I i
think that in fact I'm not connected by

381
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,770
as for GM connected by 2g so said

382
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,710
websites when it's a little bit through
and

383
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,770
what use is that everything is in HD too
P

384
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:55,650
it's not encrypt it LinkedIn is using

385
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,300
some HTTPS for the login for example but

386
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,600
all the remaining is and and encrypt it
mom

387
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,650
most of the information linking up
public so it's not really a problem

388
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,470
more or less because you have solutions
cookies are

389
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,820
eid is on in like that and

390
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,130
the you may have some problems with
private messages

391
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,020
all this kind of thing so you can play
with

392
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,410
the application and you see on will the
workstation

393
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,640
so the daytime in with time and you can

394
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,809
use as usual

395
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:39,470
scissor request the answer et cetera up

396
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,460
of course this method is useful but each
of something which is encrypted

397
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,730
as a set for example you on this is the
packets

398
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,880
sorry but that's you are not able to see
inside the packets

399
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,700
but at least we you see also supports

400
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,950
which are used uses the DNS request you
can manage the first reconnaissance

401
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,179
of work %uh depositions doing and the
next demonstration

402
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:08,500
arm weary lukic deeper into packets

403
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,860
win we will use a proxy

404
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,920
to be able to intercept all and I'm

405
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,059
with a approach he would like

406
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,409
burp will be able to intercept a
connection to modify it

407
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,690
and to see what happened we were not
modified

408
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,150
in the

409
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,840
mmm traffic because we don't have the
authorization of

410
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,810
so or no yep tradition we went we don't
want to

411
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,890
to attack cells really

412
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,990
want to show only person I just want to

413
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,530
see what happens on my phone with my
that up

414
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:52,190
so after birth with

415
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,570
and I K for next the most pressure on

416
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,820
is the I'm with another petition which
is called mobility

417
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,030
props you know his company

418
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,700
this is not the company's some kind of
association on if I'm not wrong

419
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,120
now based your in this film this is why
you chose

420
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:20,700
it's a petition and this time I will use
the the proximate to the first proximate

421
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,930
old explained by

422
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,210
and to so ingrained into the network
properties

423
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,080
and I will put the proxy

424
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,400
address which is the address of mine
workstation

425
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,710
statement and I'm fine

426
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,220
I'm again normally

427
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,210
investors are we to a user to none and
not connecting directly the

428
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,850
since it was not working well with the
protest demonstration

429
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,350
I will do this more less complicated

430
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,830
so no normally

431
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,840
the HTTP or HTTPS a

432
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,770
repressed are redirecting to

433
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,220
vis which is up and

434
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,610
we with I have to switch

435
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,820
of so petition

436
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,989
I can

437
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:29,989
I'm going two-mile resolve Asians

438
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,240
to Timbuktu

439
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:49,809
twister

440
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:01,600
I hope is a petition is rockin I would
try again

441
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:22,750
a chance I'm just verifying commitments

442
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,839
I know

443
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:41,839
to change that

444
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,280
I was not listening on the right or

445
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,350
I was on the listening on the go back
because I I was suppose to use

446
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,690
tournament with services when it's not
working so

447
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:04,690
again yes and now it's working

448
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,300
so this is my real i Kant because I'm a
use of my ability

449
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,360
and to see the request

450
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,060
your and

451
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,590
what is interesting this is my account
number

452
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,020
and this is not my pin code

453
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,770
so apparently to encrypt it

454
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,860
and when we phoned this kind of
information

455
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,270
we try to understand how it is in only

456
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,119
it and keep that its it apparently not a
hash

457
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,560
because it's very short so we tried to
end a stand and it pisses

458
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,730
what I will do it now I will reverse
engineering reverse engineer

459
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,230
your petition I will use I the pro

460
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,300
so latest fashion where is that the
compiler

461
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,650
I open the application

462
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,140
like any just said the applications
encrypt that by default

463
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,460
I a ridic a I read the the crypt
petitioned

464
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,560
to to through

465
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,119
I want to purchase some onto the I'm
reverse engineering

466
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,670
and we can try to the crib to

467
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,310
reverse engineer the wall application
but what I want to do in this process

468
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,670
precise cases list just to understand

469
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,280
I which is encryptor though this pin
code is password is incorrect that

470
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,260
so I have to start somewhere and a good
starting point is to

471
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,750
find the strange I would so much I

472
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,070
I mean stash suction

473
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,810
looms as train the to go back

474
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,330
yeah so PN décor something

475
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,830
so missus

476
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,150
all so

477
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,560
I'm just do

478
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,820
matures that well and

479
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,560
this is my my strange so this is my
starting point

480
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,570
this is a both a strange into the same
sense

481
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,119
it's a dominated by you and your by

482
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,200
and if I the Berkeley

483
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,270
I Stevens in the final

484
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:30,330
and I die is making the

485
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,540
Leyburn and what is important reside a

486
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,160
is that able to compute across
references

487
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,200
words the references to this arm

488
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,710
to his data so I'm going to serve
refrence

489
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:51,270
and this is or so the same strange but
this time

490
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,359
it seems a objective-c sense

491
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,150
this slips trend is pointing

492
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,710
to have produced trend and again the
words

493
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,210
such also Chris gross references to
Vince

494
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:10,040
strange and this is mike Ward it is used

495
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,540
yeah so its

496
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,060
not so complicated to read this but

497
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,500
before the demonstration I will use at
the compiler

498
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,060
so

499
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,099
this is

500
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:34,319
this is a quote look at the comp I know
tries to translate

501
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:37,900
a rhyme court into secord and

502
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,239
this is this is my strength

503
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:44,410
and I know that

504
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,829
for example the felt arm it owns my
encrypt it

505
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:50,969
pinkerton and I can remaining bills

506
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:54,920
instead of do something a chance

507
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,869
encrypt that plan and i'd

508
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:03,900
going only your try to understand what

509
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,880
the petition is doing supplications
schooling

510
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,029
something Reza class and this year's Rd
Fords

511
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:16,190
this to retrieve so preferences up the

512
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,489
application so so the user preferences
so I can remember is

513
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:23,989
to you some defaults and then

514
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:27,589
it calls lead

515
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:30,839
send 'em myth but which is value for key

516
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,950
and with something like

517
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,989
post-world to retrieve the password so

518
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:41,599
this is the passwd us

519
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,739
I'm and then

520
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:51,509
the turned on as a method which is that
they're using encoding

521
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:54,670
and for in this context means you to
give

522
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,410
8 so it takes the bus world's apparently

523
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,499
and then prepared and it caveat it

524
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,989
in to YouTube a most of the time it
doesn't do anything

525
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:08,160
at least in Europe

526
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,349
so it's us world you

527
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:16,109
it and then

528
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:19,549
it calls boers 64 encoding

529
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:22,910
and this is my encrypt that

530
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,950
in its not encrypt it its Beth

531
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,359
64 so you just have a transformation you
too if

532
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,609
8 which doesn't do anything models all
the time

533
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:36,640
ice accept each other next rent or
something like that

534
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,380
but we have a pin code so it's on
leadership and

535
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,489
it is converted in both 64

536
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:47,950
and I can verify this burp if I send his

537
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,809
to so deep water ID code

538
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:55,839
and this is my pin code

539
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,890
and this is really my pin code so I will
just have to change

540
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,989
has been called after his presentation
and

541
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:09,670
I and

542
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,499
if I'm going back your

543
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:17,049
I was such a good in with

544
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:21,009
a petition the petitioners

545
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:24,619
mobility finder in this directory

546
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,809
i win just made to the

547
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:31,430
author things and produced marine with
the reason

548
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:36,640
sleepy I'm

549
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,230
this

550
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,530
the code the at the crypt profusely is

551
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:51,930
to read them this fine and

552
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,540
again and work at this fine

553
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,580
you see that the password is in clear
text

554
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,020
this is when there was a reason it's
dangerous to

555
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,530
put pass world without some

556
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,560
households and things like that because

557
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,060
okay its on device but you can make a
mistake

558
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,190
and you can transmit disperse world on

559
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,480
WiFi network most of the time when you
use this

560
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,640
to make a reservation you are not on
your

561
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,280
well on wifi you are using the public
hotspot or something like that

562
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,940
and the last thing important to

563
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:39,140
sure

564
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,280
if you look carefully

565
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,360
this is an HTTP I'm not using

566
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,780
HTTPS so this is completely

567
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,720
send unclear it's very easy to the crypt
it's very easy to take the control

568
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,970
reservist when formations you can then
connect to the website

569
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,020
you can come third existing reservation
you can make

570
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,580
new reservation and a person will
receive

571
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,420
then-vice it's not possible to take the
car

572
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,960
because to take the term in you need a
physical

573
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,020
Cup to open the

574
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,550
secure but at least you can be make very

575
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,950
and knowing things and it's very typical

576
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:28,560
which was I position which are simple to

577
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,990
to demonstrate we have on the 20-minute
phone for the demonstration but

578
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,860
it's very typical with you this kind of
problem

579
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,270
a a lot of time the

580
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,370
as a situation for security situations
of mobile

581
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,540
application to the it's very youth

582
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:55,540
the level of security is very low and so
we have a lot of jobs

583
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,630
so I go back to the

584
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:06,630
presentation

585
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:14,810
each of some questions this

586
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,290
if I contact them I'm the problem with
this kinda for

587
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,230
a petition is that it's very difficult
to contact people

588
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:27,490
to find the right people we are trying
to contact them

589
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:32,460
at this moment farm not a very long time
but for some time

590
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,590
and the movie

591
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:41,250
ungenerous very difficult I made the
also a demonstration

592
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:46,180
almost the same presentation in Paris
with the other applications

593
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,810
%uh and the shows the SNCF

594
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:53,700
application and the the responsible of
the application

595
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,030
wealth in the room photoThe interesting
to discuss

596
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,250
with them and as a question

597
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,450
no so

598
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,590
thank you um you can find

599
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,040
more information on our website I i've
to

600
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,180
Prieto's account and or email addresses

601
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:21,180
and thank you well
