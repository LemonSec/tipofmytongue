1
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,320
so I don't but calm everybody to

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,700
to talk about

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,850
ID that

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,160
ok for a secure transactions I hope

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,690
you all enjoy it lunch and I read now
ready for

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,529
for security again and maybe some pretty
wild acre

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,800
I have started on twenty years ago as a
software developer

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,840
and of developing software for

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,520
a smart cards starting with to read
profile on the smart card the car driver

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,670
PKcs 11

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,110
plugins on Windows CSP your own

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,280
unique style pluggable authentication
modules and

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,839
did quite lot of cool stuff in

14
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:59,870
all platforms but of course that was for

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,800
married and intensive

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,900
Burke and also very expensive
unfortunately we had a lot of

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,450
banks then then to insurance companies
that

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,930
month to have high security so they paid
for it at the soonest this company's

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,620
head their solution there was no more an

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,009
other interested to go on and it was
integrated in in Windows

21
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,159
apart from now as to support for smart
cards

22
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,549
and then so my question was where is it
going now and

23
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,430
that's the reason by acecomm to Swiss
come over I am into his cum interesting

24
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:38,909
thing is

25
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,030
now the connectivity tho and objects are
connected to the

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,969
are in moving to a bar where every
various

27
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:54,899
the and a connection between the objects
and securities moving

28
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,729
out on on each device and of course the
trees come there is another

29
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,450
opportunity to 222 did 22 cool stuff

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,590
and the will few

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,810
hoof you know that Swiss combo author

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,280
the field of security okay so that's

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,200
and a pleasure to see it and

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,750
viscom bus in security since the early
days

35
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,760
am if you look at this picture about

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,000
but does it mean tho this something
about

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,590
identity each phone at its own dedicated
line that went from one desk to the

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,580
order and most

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,950
disco praline and it is also due to do
with the Securities so

40
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,030
data center said to be shut up

41
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,070
and no one could that the line and you

42
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,410
you that if you had the connection with
somebody

43
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,320
then it was on the right desk on the
right building on the right place

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,140
and things that they a lot has changed
but it's not a

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,240
actual picture today we have

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,490
a convergence of of the technology so
that they

47
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,460
to re the data their

48
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,940
movies pictures the management
information to private 8:30

49
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,290
corporate data every everything goes
overboard with just one line and its

50
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,450
it's very difficult to differentiate
while is

51
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,460
from where and who is on the other side

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,810
that's the challenge where we are going
today and that's also the reason why

53
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,870
Swisscom is investing a lot

54
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,270
in the insecurity in identity in

55
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,730
knowing whose on the other side and

56
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,250
them one of these

57
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,620
the solutions is his mister mobile ID

58
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,100
if you look back at

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,290
the picture before every has teeth old
plain old

60
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,570
telephone lines the

61
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,630
solution must

62
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,910
not only into line but also in the
protocol you had if somebody cogent LG

63
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,380
hi I'm Joe I'm from the controlling
department please give me today to

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,949
figure

65
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,930
just like maybe it's Joe maybe not

66
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,990
through the addition to figures the set
okay call I collect them and call you

67
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,440
back

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,650
for you to third telephone book looked
up the number of Joe from controlling

69
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,970
you find him you knew

70
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,100
it was the right guy in called him back
so this

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,110
more security in how you handled the
technology 10

72
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,880
in the technology itself just let me
show

73
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,450
new one pictured to make this point
again so

74
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,750
if the city's water but you drink it yes
or no

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,200
and maybe it depends it depends on what
you know where you are

76
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,150
but just picked but your information is
maybe you heard on the radio that there

77
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,000
is a small problem with the water but

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,480
infected clean or not no problem to
think so

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,170
what you really do want depends on what
you know

80
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,520
and that's where

81
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,260
the security is going if you look at the
picture how

82
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,200
internet or your banking securities dawn
today

83
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,310
you're ready to hurt this morning to
problem is that

84
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,000
if you sent something from your laptop
from you banking account

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,710
on the other side on the bank I don't
really know if

86
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,770
but they've received his butt you sent
or if there is some

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,389
man in the middle men in the browser to
changed your information

88
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,030
so they use for new technologies

89
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,110
sending SMS to you

90
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,480
asking you hate that's what we received
is this really what you think

91
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,750
and the use you again to to make up some
protocol that there's more security in

92
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,290
technology and and was providing the
base technology

93
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,590
but for the connectivity here dismiss
com and on the other side he is also

94
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,450
Swisscom

95
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,660
and the PE

96
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,840
analyze the situation and ask those how
could be make some

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,870
put more security in Deshawn

98
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,070
transaction here because

99
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,180
the underlying concept that's not being
built

100
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,370
for the security has been built for

101
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,020
communication sending short messages

102
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,850
but it has no authentication and eat be
don't know how to confidently each

103
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,990
confidentiality federal

104
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,020
and of course it has no wait to

105
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,169
to for non-repudiation cannot prove

106
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:58,310
if and what he says he wrote to use the
phone for what we know what you wanted

107
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,850
to receive

108
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,430
and that's what me asked us how quickly
achieve more security in all the stuff

109
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,500
and with the mobile technology we

110
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,300
and up in something because mobile ID

111
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,500
that and support a lot of use cases

112
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,410
a rethink the future we go and we need
them to provide

113
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,280
secure transactions are implications

114
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,350
but what you paid it is just the base
there's just a

115
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,060
communication and 23 burkhardt
applications can be made

116
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,160
thank you and what has to be done over
this layer

117
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,010
other applications as be don't provide
implication that what's

118
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,910
I V college us to Freiburg for secure
authentication and secure

119
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,300
and transactions

120
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,080
I have been computer examples but
transactions can be done

121
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,660
few moments adjustment to show you what

122
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,280
I understand when we talk about mobile
it. because

123
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,160
mobile ID is a buzz word in there are a
lot of the know a lot of

124
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,139
solutions that and used about mobile I D
mich.

125
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,889
rich are good in what they are doing but
it's not

126
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:21,430
on concept that everybody is the same
you on it

127
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,650
but I want to the

128
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:32,650
point out or what berm

129
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,829
seeing assist the base functionality
Disney that within a mobile IT

130
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:41,630
is headquartered available on cell
phones

131
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,500
because everybody has the cell phone
with it inflates

132
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,209
from think that snoopy kruschev it's
based on Sony

133
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,959
use the SIM card distorting prediction
and to do to encryption

134
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,240
so we have to computing power and the
secure storage for

135
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,619
at the cryptographic information on

136
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:09,059
on the use and everybody has it in his
pocket

137
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,769
and of course we use the SIM card or
using Carter whatever they are

138
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,779
for technology to executes the crypto

139
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:21,670
graphic operations in it

140
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:28,670
yes

141
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,800
mmm

142
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,070
so the questions about the performance
and and how it's the usability

143
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,460
a comer yes

144
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,100
at come back to your question i'd if you
have an overview of how to security

145
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,170
concepts are billed

146
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,370
than a calm can come back to the
question but just to make a chart we

147
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,010
have a prototype that's running

148
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,970
and I can show it to you on on our
booties John Kander to see how the

149
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,970
performances and what's going on there

150
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,670
but there is a it's a good question I
hope that some answers you'll find in

151
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,900
presentations

152
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,900
and but

153
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,120
but also within the concept with me
instead as mobile ID is that

154
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,850
that messages that are sent to the phone
can be encrypted

155
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,080
and are included for that phone only so

156
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,820
you have to confidentiality on the line
and but you

157
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,960
receive and but you confirm on the phone
can be sent back signed

158
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,680
and Justin on the provincial you can if
not trippin

159
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,830
am you could prove that

160
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,800
it's a it's mostly you said you and

161
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,770
but

162
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,890
only the technology this debate both
underlying on the under the mobile ID

163
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,240
but

164
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,160
to important part is that the supporting
processes

165
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,660
need also to be made in a way that
secure but the unstained

166
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,780
regarding the process for example the
same card

167
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,350
that's between your mobile phone has to
be provided to you in a secure way

168
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,460
in a trusted past that it cannot be
exchange be a non-secure

169
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,620
said cart over the way until you have it
put in your phone

170
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,680
the new television itself has to be done
determining factor or

171
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,240
in secure environment that you know that
it's

172
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,020
really written on the card expect to be
there not because

173
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,950
and the user identification

174
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,320
how phone is handed over to the user how
to

175
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,900
key is bound to the user with he enters
his pin for the key

176
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,180
has to be done in a secure way because
if the

177
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,430
wrong user receives the same phone you
can impersonate somebody else

178
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,110
and and def

179
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,570
also leads that detective is in
personalization processes all have to be

180
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,540
done in a secure

181
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,780
and way so

182
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,960
that it's not modern technology in it
that is a lot of processes that have to

183
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,820
be set up

184
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,430
and a.m. be executed

185
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,370
in the trust tree so

186
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,860
I think they both think would be if I
give you some examples

187
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,920
how dismal by D can be used so

188
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,750
the both use cases access to the land
it's a

189
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,810
simple to imagine just

190
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,010
think of but you used today for example
secure ID

191
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,980
if you want to access alone from your
home on your corporate network

192
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,110
so another employees whose outside the
corporate network month texas Islam

193
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,860
and bet he usually uses

194
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,460
he starts a VPN and you sorry uses his

195
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,860
secure ID to enter his am credentials

196
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,500
he can just use the smartphone

197
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,410
their at lunch tough smartphone is
dollars has it with him

198
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,650
if I forget their phone at home either
go back and and fetch it again

199
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,750
first forget my secure I did home I just

200
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,110
see tonight when I needed when is too
late so but the

201
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,810
baton to two of two phone and

202
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,870
the

203
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,280
smartphone is also all those connected

204
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,780
is all is in order to you too looks
itself

205
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,190
himself or his police smartphone so

206
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,370
and can you see to it that

207
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,060
button often the beach is OK I go to the
process

208
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,270
I V tree they just one is employees so
it's been difficult but it's

209
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:06,140
his home second is the corporate network
that's where he wants to connect

210
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,710
and Turkmenistan mobile ID back-end
that's the service layer

211
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:15,730
a.m. of of to provide them so what he
does when he wants to login into network

212
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,120
is

213
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,420
just started bpm it's been to connect

214
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,030
the connections with to the VPN
connected it's the same as

215
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,280
if you do login with secure ID you can
connect to reject the

216
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,360
user credentials with whatever is
provided for information

217
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,220
a.m. about to the user he maps to

218
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,350
username to his more by number

219
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,790
and then replace notification prior
commitment

220
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,370
provider and saint and SMS

221
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,530
which is a in cryptic binary SMS

222
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,890
to the cell phone the user confirms tax
assessed to enter

223
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,260
her separate pin for the execution of
two key to

224
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,220
and sign SMS he received and been sent
back

225
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,150
a signed SMS to the provider network
provided 10

226
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,270
Easter confirm Texas

227
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,620
to the corporate lon

228
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,530
and third that he was a real big run to
Texas to tonight

229
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,420
affect its this is a very simple use
cases the interfaces

230
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,310
I V you see here are radios interfaces

231
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,130
so you can exchange the existing

232
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,350
a.m. authentication platform or

233
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,160
authentication token just so mean it's
just need to complicate configuring like

234
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,010
this to another

235
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,130
and rages interfaith

236
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,850
and to provide that you have a meeting
from the user ID to the mobile

237
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,990
number so that the

238
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,750
very easy use case that's something
that's the

239
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,180
you have a prototype built and this can
all see the performance for a phone

240
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,270
execution of tissues case

241
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,620
and there is much more in the

242
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,380
functionality within days is more but I
D

243
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,300
sex abuse case is one that's not based
on a

244
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,180
secondary device you can do it without
your laptop am

245
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,600
matching use the bodies on a business
trip aunt in its

246
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,000
his laptop with him he wants to exit but
unfortunately has

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,380
a.m. for coldness Park password did some

248
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,350
trials and password is account has been
has been locked

249
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,360
so but the can he do his a.m. a protest
not

250
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,510
access to the to and

251
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,930
his their administrator

252
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,190
but fortunately that company is an
ultimate password reset system very

253
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,960
can call wit his their cell phone

254
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,620
and these that it here s how we call it

255
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,150
is configure to request confirmation to

256
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,380
the mobile ID so what he does is he
calls

257
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,760
the ultimate answering system

258
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,709
again the system verifies the user if it
is

259
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:21,230
misuse rate database triggers

260
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,160
on them about it. bekannt that the

261
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,690
SMS its length for the user but the user
confidence

262
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,030
yes I triggered

263
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,230
Password Reset with the system for the
connections made

264
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,430
that but he treated here

265
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,270
even to see here as well as a message it
is not somebody else

266
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,250
were triggered it the more it cannot be
spoofed from the name because

267
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,810
he called here from another phone or the
phone numbers verified here

268
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,640
he receives the message

269
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,000
after confirmation is sent to the

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,790
home about it. big-tent mobile ID pic
and consent the spotlight this

271
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,680
confirmation 22

272
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,660
and 2.2 mid system system receives

273
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,840
an SMS that the sign with the user

274
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,930
key that he is on his mobile phone for
key he can

275
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,630
automatically verified that the

276
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,550
confirmation is from the user antique
and verify

277
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,640
Sierra and everything to stand between
the peak environment

278
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,330
see that's the user releases still valid

279
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,179
but but but is he those the butt buddies
he does not need to trust

280
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:41,450
the Bay Kent system from them about it.
he does not receive a yes or no

281
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,060
he was a month presided he receives the
message

282
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,140
a.m. assigned to crest

283
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,920
a dick an archive it for later the proof
if you need to do whatever he wants to

284
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,679
do

285
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,690
a you can just but if I the user

286
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,820
we'll reading on message and

287
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,250
any kind generate a new password set it
on the system

288
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,610
again trigger on the mobile ID pic and
that the new password these

289
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,130
for added to the user and because it's
recruited he was a preseason cryptid

290
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,840
password that cannot be intercepted on
the line

291
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,620
and is depicted on the mobile system his
C-seventeen

292
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,130
can enter it on to

293
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,780
on his left that's another use case

294
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,210
minimal but I D and and abused

295
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,650
you have more of them for example if you
imagine assigning service citing service

296
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,450
something

297
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,450
where you sign a legally binding

298
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,850
documents so

299
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,490
you need some specials key to be to do
that

300
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,620
the skis you normally do not store under
smartphone because

301
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,720
to

302
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,250
the need special protection

303
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,250
you don't want to carry them but did you
you can

304
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,260
have them in a bag and stored in a pay
just immature

305
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,400
but you can trigger the

306
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,420
signature of a document the following
for example

307
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,720
you have PDF document want to sign you
can upload these documents to

308
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,650
can your corporate network where signing
services running

309
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,550
the service very feister document

310
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,780
calculates the hash because you site has
show for document

311
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,190
displaced is Hersh on the user's

312
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,870
phone and at the same time he sends

313
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,640
confirmation request or heat press
confirmation to the mall but I T Beck

314
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,300
and

315
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,390
which again frenzied

316
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,310
message to the phone phone will display
the message

317
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,900
an you triggered signing of a document
document has

318
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,900
hershey's spelling please a.m. and that
your

319
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,580
paid if you want to have to sign it so
you can again

320
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,160
but if I dash if it's the same page that
after document that you enter

321
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,260
to make sure that has not been changed
on the way to the signing service

322
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,620
and if you are a.m.

323
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,030
supposedly you have positively
identified the document

324
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,400
then you win again sent the confirmation
to the big tent

325
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,010
document can be that signed SMS

326
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,240
percent to designing service which can
verified

327
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,780
and signed the document and of course

328
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,020
the trigger after signing can again be

329
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,300
archived for later proof that

330
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:48,300
both the enough to use to use the ski

331
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,750
just after two committees signed use and
are not to sign document

332
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,429
so he can to a very critical

333
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:01,900
operation just by using mobile phone
trigger

334
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,700
critical operations with to softer
friend no but I def remember

335
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,980
and the

336
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,360
Louth use kids want to show you his run
their

337
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,770
user again has on his mobile phone

338
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,299
you mentioned seat you're sitting
somewhere

339
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:24,660
in the departure lounge in an airport

340
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,299
a.m. in the

341
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,070
in another country is not in the same
her

342
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,130
network of mobile provide for example
you don't know how many

343
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,270
the roaming in fantasy the messages on
the phone call takers who is listening

344
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,490
to it and everything

345
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,070
and when he's there he's informed about

346
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,240
to suspect detected accurate russian is
the

347
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,250
laboratories and

348
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,540
that he decides okay bebe you call our
net for provide

349
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,750
please detach our network from from the
internet

350
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,020
and now he calls

351
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,770
the helpdesk and the pool help defuse it
there

352
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,140
it's not really sure if this is really
the CDO is

353
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,980
calling or is that call maybe itself a
denial of service attack

354
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:21,140
from somebody else what can you do

355
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,610
but using the mobile ID framework

356
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,510
he can trigger a message

357
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,040
again a confirmation that asked on that
its

358
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,540
shown on the cell phone off to seek your

359
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,669
please confirm you want to detach the
network

360
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:43,750
seek your teeth this message

361
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,790
and it was him that called there and not

362
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,070
somebody answered denials those turkey
view and police being called

363
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,419
and again confirmations for modded to
system that operated

364
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,440
sees that its Tennessee kill

365
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,440
confirmed to the touch

366
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,650
do you have any questions regarding this
the use cases and

367
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:22,650
yes please

368
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,230
yes you need it's perfect notification
just

369
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,970
unity t-mobile need to own it

370
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:36,559
and you need to know the PIN because but
depend so in our test its

371
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,500
62 concerted the longer its it

372
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,180
can divide by penal for it it's like a
two-factor authentication you need

373
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,450
the mobile phone and you need to know
the PIN to bed to enter into a

374
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:58,450
ask each time you want to confirm
message to enter this pin

375
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:29,700
so yes

376
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:46,799
yes

377
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,500
so yes you're right that the question is
as

378
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,320
question is about the 02 P if you
compare it through to our sauf

379
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,540
or 2p keys which are generated over time
for a change

380
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,020
and the the problem you mentioned here
is that

381
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,160
if somebody has to keep me or

382
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,680
has installed from software to treat the
key he can execute

383
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,310
this the actions so I can I come back to
the problem

384
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,140
of for software on the phone that reach
the key am

385
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,680
just won the remark regarding or 2p TOTP

386
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,490
changes for example to prevent replay a
tux

387
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,610
of such things and here it's important
that

388
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,250
if you sent these confirmation it also
overtimes empty

389
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,930
here so I Sego with the name

390
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,640
confirmed detection of the network on
Wednesday blah blah blahhhh so

391
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,490
detect times them that's also important
if you want to have to archive it for

392
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,640
the non-repudiation

393
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,640
and to prevent replay a tux

394
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:28,580
yes

395
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,830
but the second point so the the one
point is that about the and

396
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,659
changing and deal to pee number so that
you know

397
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,730
don't have to. non-repudiation and the
second one is Texas took her to the

398
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,399
phone where

399
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:50,149
a comeback in a few minutes and any
other questions regarding the use cases

400
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:54,950
okay

401
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:01,000
so I propose that the a charger just a
short movie

402
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,330
and that has been the don't buy dismiss
calm

403
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,460
innovation departments that I think
about how the future

404
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,450
me look like became a bitter lot of
other use cases I did mention here

405
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,899
money for example if you want to money
toward heartbeat

406
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:21,490
of people and and think information to
some

407
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,070
some medical center of course it has
also

408
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,399
to be authenticated admit ordered its

409
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:34,269
from from the right source am but

410
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:39,179
some use cases that are far more in
futures are displayed in

411
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,740
in this movie I don't want to go into
detail of them but I think it's an

412
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,350
interesting movie adjustment to

413
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:51,350
show

414
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,140
okay the focus of dis

415
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,010
movies ten years from now by the think
would I hope that you all

416
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:01,450
agree with me that mobile devices

417
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,990
the authentication and confidential
transmission

418
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,330
of of information will be crucial and

419
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:14,140
now I would like to go into the security
considerations for

420
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,990
for but the Freiburg to build this the
solution on

421
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,260
I have your picture of two the
components

422
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,559
that will be used for such a mobile ID
for a bird the

423
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,809
light blue display to provider

424
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:33,370
infrastructure and teeth that are crazy
out the application provider for both

425
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,760
basically like to is the framework and

426
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,659
dark gray is lot could be built on top
of the framework

427
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:45,590
so of course we have one month sign on
one side

428
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,799
there smartphone student at the cell
phones the cell phone's user

429
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,039
specific and same states and you seem
that

430
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,799
provide the script to functionality meet
and

431
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,679
specialized same pled that those two
functionality of time about it.

432
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,320
information is transmitted to the mobile
ID back end

433
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,320
displayed here over-the-air

434
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,679
and fixed-line X's and duplication
provided his connect

435
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,929
to the mobile phone into the well but I
debate can't

436
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,539
for some internet connections and of
course but also it's important

437
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:27,539
there's a lot of supplies to sim supply
itself on supply or the supply is but

438
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:28,100
also

439
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,169
part of the whole solution and

440
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:36,850
if you look at the would have been it is
all about the problems of dissolution

441
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,640
you have a lot of time so the

442
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,690
smartphones can be corrupted the p

443
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,779
can be intercepted that what the not
before

444
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,820
the SIM card can be

445
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,360
exchange can be another SIM card

446
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,549
the scene a plate can be wrong

447
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:02,600
can be be placed communication can be

448
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,720
the

449
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,820
broken can be and minus to meet him
change we don't have to

450
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,299
and

451
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:17,830
problems with the the bacon so the
security of the whole system is

452
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,929
quite difficult patch an engine to prove

453
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,620
but I know want to do is to

454
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,690
to go to the steps and show you how we
will assured that that can be done the

455
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,320
right way

456
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,539
what's the most important point is the
same car to think art is key because

457
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:37,690
it all sticky sweet generates the keys
and

458
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,639
make sure that the keys can only be
accessed exist if the right penis and

459
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:42,000
put

460
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,909
am month 2002

461
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:51,820
which one of these one this twister too
quick to see missus your be

462
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,950
to the point guard to make it's
difficult to tell you

463
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,200
don't see on the same card bitch which
is the right one

464
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,529
if you

465
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:08,460
want to use a SIM card your to have to
start with the right process you have to

466
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,349
retrieve it from the right source make
sure that on the whole transport

467
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:16,710
it is not exchanged and

468
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,000
all people handling it are confidential

469
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,449
trust people so that you have the real

470
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,820
the right think our in your phone a when
you want to use it

471
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,970
so you need a certified Trek it

472
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,530
appropriate production utilization and
distribution of

473
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,070
have to see in cart and

474
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,899
as I told you forties mobile ID

475
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,580
functionality in the UB we have seen
induce case before terror

476
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,349
specialized functions or decide just
wanna have to be built and

477
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:57,770
loaded on the SIM card but said seem at
but

478
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,589
to also be stored on SIM card in the
secure a and

479
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:05,270
today the most think utmost your

480
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,869
Java Card most people to secure a

481
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:14,580
and if your picture of but what this
means

482
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,109
so the smart cards have a operating
system

483
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:24,760
operating system has to support the
security features of smart card

484
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,089
mostly distance proven by certifications

485
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:32,680
its common criteria yelled for price or
wetlands

486
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,250
then you have Anna platform

487
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,569
Java platform global platform on the
smart card

488
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:43,400
again he's has to be proven that it is
implemented in the right very

489
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,170
and uses the security functions that are

490
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,000
the exposed by the operating system
guarantees can be proven by

491
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,470
certifications and

492
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:00,060
what's the common certification yet if
the Java Card protection profile to

493
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,430
has been defined I

494
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:08,730
globe platform andy is also used to
bases on Common Criteria to

495
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,089
usually much teeth

496
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,310
Java Card protection profile defiance is
that

497
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,140
there tell a car runtime environment to
be a time machine

498
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,930
day API's are and

499
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,710
working correctly that the applications
themselves are fire also that they

500
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,280
cannot

501
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,310
reached a two-run from from from the
order

502
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:37,540
the ex's control to the to the keys or
to the applications is

503
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,400
a.m. defined key generation process

504
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,750
and Texas to the generation process his

505
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,270
verified that it's done in the right way

506
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,700
there are a lot of under different
sections of teeth

507
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,980
Kalakaar protection provides for these
functions are in the cold

508
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,619
and profile the vote for the smart card
platform

509
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:03,810
banner the basement not a tease them
approved the city operating system to

510
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,619
feel embarrassed

511
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,160
smart card is implement the right way

512
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,849
bytecode verification to cart miniature
the law order

513
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,550
so Easter publication and operating
system loaded

514
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,720
right way lot of tests that needs to be
done to make sure to

515
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,540
SIM card

516
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,490
is secure and is able not

517
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,780
Pena temperature with before you even

518
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,690
start using it

519
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:39,180
and to make sure

520
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,930
but you have to rise in cart you need to
trust provided

521
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,210
and provided they can tell you are asked
him are you

522
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:52,160
supporting this job a car protection
profile with at least on this group here

523
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,980
and the bestest is to provide idk I'm
show

524
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,770
testers certification has been gone by a
third-party company that you trust

525
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,990
but certifies that it has been on the
right me

526
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,040
that's just regarding the SIM card and

527
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,740
giblets put on SIM card

528
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:19,210
but there is not more in it and I think
both

529
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,310
one point be made before is that the
perception of to

530
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,130
PIN entry to date the

531
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,720
communication between the the same

532
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,109
the trip to cart and terminus stone in
plain text

533
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,680
so every think that goes art from the
same

534
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,490
and is displayed to you alright you
entered a ghost on again to the same

535
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,280
can be intercepted think that's the
point you

536
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,480
you made before today

537
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,260
there is no known

538
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,690
a.m.

539
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:03,220
exploit of that so that wealth about
both

540
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,040
told by Jamal too and we ask them but

541
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,500
yuri it's possible to do it

542
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,270
and what's the solution is unique year
smart phones that are built on

543
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:20,040
the trusted platform

544
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,290
their own components themselves

545
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,100
are proven and Anna verify

546
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,170
that each year they call

547
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,910
are not modified the in the meantime

548
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,780
so that's the challenging to cry but the
specifications for forties

549
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,510
exists in some year but

550
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,220
there are no the broadly dispute phones
where vertices

551
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,330
to implement and of course then

552
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,630
if you have to trust the environment you
have

553
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,170
to use to the right protocol that make
sure that what you enter

554
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,080
on the phone or what is displayed on the
terminal is what the same

555
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,470
Saint to to you today the

556
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,240
maybe in work how is it done today there
is a

557
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,230
sim toolkit is specification that
implemented on all phones that SIM card

558
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,170
can use

559
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,170
to telephone please please please make
just or please ask the user to enter pin

560
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,000
seem talkative implemented by each Anna

561
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,480
operating system provider

562
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,839
and that's a compliment that has to be
hacked if you want to change or to

563
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,339
modify or to intercept

564
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:42,339
to author the communication with the
user from siempre con

565
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,930
but if you have heart but it's built on
on but when you commit sure that

566
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,950
entry cannot be modified at the user
sees what

567
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,339
seen card months you but displayed
values

568
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:02,810
but seek

569
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:09,810
yes peace

570
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,890
so I agree with you that the problem and
I don't think that the current operating

571
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,609
systems

572
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:59,730
can solve this problem did

573
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:06,730
in short I'm so

574
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:46,320
but that's right so you have to make
sure that your yeah

575
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,720
yeah

576
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:56,720
and I think

577
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,680
think completely agree that's a problem
that's not solve nope that's baby salt

578
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,400
in future

579
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,550
there's bitches specifications actress
there

580
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,300
and we need somebody to implemented the
person is who

581
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,140
would implement that and we'll use this
except such a phone but

582
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,850
because it will be it reduced
functionality and usability whatever it

583
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,190
is

584
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:22,860
so this problem here is right

585
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:27,390
is dislike card reader venue compared
with betrayal a smart card

586
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,550
you can use a class 1 card reader class
to

587
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,630
hosty card reader but it's the tissue
decision of the user

588
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,660
what you want to use and if you have
secure

589
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,720
mobile phones there you have it you
succeed

590
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,440
yes

591
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,290
that's that's a problem but it's the
decision on the use we could just

592
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,770
provide the platform and but

593
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:56,710
phone to use the decision of 10 but

594
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,500
the within a compact hits her and

595
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,630
another point we need to look at is that
the communication from the back

596
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:08,180
and to the SIM card and

597
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,910
a secure more but I'd implementation
needs and crypto keys that are

598
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,850
individual for each think our he can

599
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:20,430
half at encrypted communication from the
back end

600
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,480
to into the seem have but

601
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,990
that's on the card so the complete

602
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,500
communication infrastructure

603
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,830
cannot intercept cannot modify the
message it's an end-to-end encryption

604
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,650
never copy of the key

605
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:44,360
the bacon to cope with two key and
kasari the vacancy a copy of taking the

606
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,090
pic and the copying the same card

607
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,430
your her think our

608
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:55,400
and separating fiction piece a

609
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,890
could even be possible that application
providers have

610
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,030
separate keys for data applications so
each application provided 10

611
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,130
encrypt from his application to the same
car

612
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:12,140
SIM cards have enough storage space

613
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,900
for putting enough keys there to support
more applications

614
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,350
and of course again you need to trust
the distribution process

615
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,550
that is key the keys that are put on the
mobile

616
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,500
ID SIM card are disputing the secure

617
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,620
way to the mobile ID pic and and also
store

618
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:37,600
in the security the

619
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,700
then that their artists the usual
problems the

620
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:46,110
if you look at the home and service
providers

621
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,590
and security providers pinned

622
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,950
outsourcing clout and

623
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,560
solutions you don't know what

624
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,660
but what's really behind it if the
secure environment like this one

625
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,180
or is just some some hick to to provide

626
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,860
their solutions from a secure operations
center

627
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,370
Rogers just provided summer from from
another county

628
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,980
so here again

629
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,990
the measures would be check

630
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,560
for certifications samples are saw
seventies

631
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,450
all the certs sake salon PCI DSS

632
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,660
and but important and

633
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,320
every of fifties mobile IT solutions
would be PK I certification my teeth

634
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,300
it see certifications because PKR
certifications look at the whole process

635
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,270
all softer

636
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:46,300
user identification the key generation
of

637
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,270
the sneaky complete life cycle of old
keith

638
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,310
for to certificates that are accepted
are provided for the users

639
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:59,050
but again here you need

640
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,420
to rely on certifications and make sure
that to provide issues decertification

641
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,990
a good team also for but years to you so
too

642
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,380
to rely on is look at them if they are
in some

643
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,460
root certificate programs for tampering
does Apple Salem

644
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,730
because they a.m.

645
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:23,890
puts the rules on and checks on but
certificates to their putting the route

646
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:24,740
stores

647
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:30,230
and they are also frequently challenge
if they are still sick you

648
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,550
for example the Bee does ask that

649
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,130
to be not accept any certificates issued
from

650
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:42,290
next year that are not that are using
shot one

651
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:46,000
which is too weak and the other one for
Canon force it because they see

652
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,880
on the client's if a certificate that's
been issued after

653
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,390
first generate 2012 stage was a share on

654
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,310
can pull it out of two program so nobody
will do it but most remained within this

655
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,130
program but also quoted

656
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:02,760
and certifications and also look if

657
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,840
accompanist ensuite its they into root
certificate

658
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,580
so you can be online noted the keynote
are for example

659
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,560
by the POSCO put you know towns they
typically did not pass credit was

660
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,800
if they were sure that it was secure
they could but

661
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,120
have put was going there but so nobody
knows

662
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,240
was mosque but we know but the most of

663
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,090
users didn't know it okay so I come
could end

664
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:34,760
I think and if you look at 21 abilities
again

665
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,990
there is risk into devices

666
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,700
and that risk will remain because a.m.

667
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,710
today no security bison available to
really be available

668
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,600
maybe a soon

669
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,900
but if users except it is the other
questions

670
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,540
seem applets security security solution
cannot be proven by de ser

671
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,740
P Kelly standards also the communication
is encrypted

672
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,780
processes are covered by the PQ no
standards and another one ability to

673
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,420
maintain how is duplication provided

674
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,300
implementing his solution on the
framework and how is he

675
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,610
implementing explosives

676
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,350
at regarding the

677
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:24,670
no discussion we had before

678
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,110
about the to devices

679
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,290
food solutions that are defined for
mobility always are

680
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:37,380
a some have to some trade-off between
the mobility usability convenience

681
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,220
flexibility

682
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,660
and end-user built probably know not to
any

683
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,750
compromise the mobility ring convenience

684
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,690
even if those smartphone to sell funds
would be available

685
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,359
but think about one problem

686
00:49:56,359 --> 00:50:00,670
here the weakest point now on the
solution is this

687
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:05,500
not the cell phone it's the user and
that could be in a tape measure say

688
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,050
the power plug today use the same
interfaith a state exchange issues that

689
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,609
can be

690
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:16,320
heck auditorium into power plug and
retard stator

691
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,540
and then you're also dawn so it's really
if you want to build a secure system

692
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,270
you have to to cover much more then

693
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:29,000
just be secure platform in here also
have to change the behavior of the user

694
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,020
and but he was accepts and how you
handle 60

695
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,880
okay so I think your true if you have

696
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,150
any other questions we'll be happy to
answer them on the

697
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,600
who's we have here and Genna can also
show

698
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,990
you with the prototype see the
performance

699
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,040
how it's going into believes

700
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,140
okay thank you for the attention

701
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,670
way
