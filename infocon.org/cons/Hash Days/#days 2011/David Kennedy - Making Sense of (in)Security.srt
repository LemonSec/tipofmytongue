1
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,630
all rights you started

2
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,810
so I'm Dave Kennedy I'm I'm a chief
security officer at a fortune 1000

3
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,970
company I wrote the social engineering
toolkit

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,720
fast track and a new talk of artillery
arm

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,150
6 was the work ago there's

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,890
emina backtracked on Team that's where
the development team

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,850
and miss gonna penetration tester expert
writer much but other things

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,040
and so when I came over the stalk

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,720
I Y I i was looking at were and security
in a lot of things I see in the industry

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,230
and the penetration testing executions
and you said and that talk was

11
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,210
a lot about it by I get to see a lot of
unique things

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,770
in my position in life unique things
when I do assessments for other

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,480
companies

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,880
and so a pose a question to everybody in
the audience here

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,390
who here feels that they can withstand a
targeted attack against our company

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,689
so yes

17
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,689
this generation I get so not a lot
people

18
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:21,030
and so why is that why can't we were
standing targeted attack as

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,030
infrastructure as a as a national
industry and so the first thing is we

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,700
are secure

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,860
right we aren't able to protect against
attacks

22
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,159
or scared of guys like this

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,680
running around and we're worrying

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,240
during all that right

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,990
and reset their in the San hoping that
we were going to be the next ones to be

26
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,680
attacked

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,510
because we knew that our security wasn't
any better whatsoever

28
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,710
and so instead of being indicted in a
front of security

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,580
we prayed please don't let this be the
next ones to get preacher hacked

30
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,930
and I've noticed the security community
during the time love

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,299
loss after anonymous but everybody was
silent no one's at anything negative

32
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,989
about sign about him no one wins spoke
against them

33
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,939
it's really just a really I don't wanna
touch there because I don't want to be

34
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:12,640
act right

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,209
and sorry washing we waitin and we saw
different companies get breached right

36
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,239
saw more more MORE which

37
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,370
ironically was bicycle injection are and
more

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,049
and more and more and sorry a lot this
year

39
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:37,049
rain so we have a lot of bridges this
year we had a significant number

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,650
as a risk aired and so we hire
consultants

41
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,849
clickers really well to hire some
consultants Ryan

42
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,569
the fixer challenges industry and we get
the certs

43
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:56,439
do you give us more knowledge to expand
our knowledge

44
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,319
and we invest in compliance to protect
us

45
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,040
to secure organization right and we are
free we

46
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,239
prioritize what we're doing so we can
incorporate mismanagement

47
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,169
week re complexity with risk formulas

48
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,319
and we spend right

49
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,829
it's kinda industry right now so why do
we suck

50
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,730
well in order to answer the question and
I'll answer that question and I'll give

51
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,760
an answer I'm fixin

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,109
really need to understand the past
present future of where we came from and

53
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,029
security

54
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:35,569
as a security kinda started off a little
bit like this

55
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:40,680
you know maybe ten years ago or so
formerly and so before we had hackers we

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,209
hadn't

57
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,519
you know their national security
community would hackers come out and do

58
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,829
different types of things which can
respond the industry as we know it today

59
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,939
you start off with hackers and how to
protect against hackers and so

60
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:57,779
we came out to and so technology
progressed sorted hackers

61
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,319
and where is born in the security
industry

62
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,629
as you flash forward to today

63
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,519
this is what I've you today s right

64
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,889
it's a complete trainwreck if you look
at statistics from 2009 to 2010 if you

65
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,070
look at the industry as a whole

66
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,430
security conferences record a record
number of attendees

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,360
you guys here is a prime example yes
we're in here 10 years ago next

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,130
some remind me to get to the point tell
store but I wasn't here

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,400
and if you look at how the industry
started to

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,850
groan groan grow we had a record number
but any security staff

71
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,640
decrease during the recession is United
States and when up

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,350
when I spent an estimated one billion
just on security in Windows Vista and 7

73
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,550
which okay

74
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,990
on in 2008

75
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,020
sure looking at how we're doing for
bridge this prospective

76
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,540
the screen senator Carr privacy rights
that or and he does in a terse 354

77
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,100
reported public data breaches RBS
WorldPay is one of them has a bazillion

78
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,070
amount of social security numbers into
in 2009

79
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,840
there's only two nitee to so we got
better I

80
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,470
unfortunately there are literally the
largest bridges we've ever seen in the

81
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,400
history of like bridges ever

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,780
the largest amount a PCI data paji paji
everything else just got destroyed a

83
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,460
year

84
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,630
and say look at 2010 we spent over 34
percent more on security from 2009 to

85
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,430
2010

86
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,900
34 percent more as an industry it
doesn't end there's five or ninety four

87
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,290
reportable within regions

88
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,350
over double that of last year it's a
good coverage statistics that's kinda

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,170
how it looks

90
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,750
right pretty graphs look at security
spanned

91
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,950
kinda how looks rain

92
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,430
and so we buy products protect us

93
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,550
we're the only industry that I know of
the King keep increasing

94
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,040
are expenditure expenditures and
continue to get worse

95
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,710
the second issue sorry weatherman other
first but

96
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,820
as in her head I mean I I was told it
was going to rain my entire way here and

97
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,650
a

98
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,140
has won the most obvious flights have
ever had in my life but you buy these

99
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,930
products right they're gonna fix it

100
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,090
by intrusion prevention hereby quicker

101
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,680

and after a banner data loss prevention
anomaly detection her istics

105
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,480
shiny stuff right this is what we're
told to buy to fix

106
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,330
the crap that we have right now in
security

107
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,160
and all those a failed us because they
don't work

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,410
as anybody read the OP implemented

109
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,790
where one is why anybody here have it
working

110
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,800
as anybody do anything other than
looking for social security numbers and

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,780
credit cards

112
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,560
okay checking as anybody stop taps

113
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,720
even know if anybody is really had after
are

114
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
what that really is the gala getting the
cloud with the first 15 minutes use

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,380
playing with the cloud is

116
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,290
so we have consultants right and
consultants are designed to come in and

117
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,580
fix our problems because they know a
better than us

118
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,000
to hire these guys to come in and do our
security assessments in our penetration

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,030
tests n

120
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,200
our risk assessments in you know I it
not to pick on the Big Five

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,450
because we're they're all guilty of it
but they come in they give you this this

122
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,830
model of how you need architecture
enterprise security

123
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,540
arm program missus five-year plan about
how you can spend

124
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,550
a million this year maybe three million
next year minutes in a decrease after

125
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,350
year after year right

126
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,860
and I have not seen a company fully
implemented as anybody implemented a

127
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,930
five year plan a security before that
actually works

128
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,430
pigan on the same page is not unique

129
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,320
to somehow they know the business better
than we do inside our own company

130
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,670
and so can we spend and /span and span
dance band

131
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,450
because that's what we're told is gonna
fix our problems we keep throwing money

132
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,410
at it

133
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,680
we're gonna be good right

134
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,260
this stuff doesn't stop us it doesn't

135
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,340
it barely stopped her

136
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,490
that's where we're at right now it
barely stopped her

137
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,700
she's a mean hacker

138
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,770
so why

139
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,650
if you look at how our balance right now
there's is an influx of

140
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,710
crap that's going on between compliance
vendors and products versus actual real

141
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,780
security in fixing things

142
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,110
you know we have all these terms like
GRC an wrist the ferment in risk manager

143
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,320
programs in

144
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,510
and all these things that are supposed
to build our programs up mature it

145
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,740
and haven't seen one that's been
decently mature and yes true did that

146
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,510
today

147
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,519
when asked you how many have you can
stop a targeted attack

148
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,759
the answer was no and I haven't in
audience that would raise their hand to

149
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,509
that

150
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:55,660
never secure an hour and are closer now

151
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,069
and see this big influx a compliance and
risk management

152
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:03,600
and really were securities is tiny
little thing

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,970
we're not actually secure organizations
but people say we're in tune with the

154
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,120
business right

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,800
the May heard that before we know the
business when you know the business with

156
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,449
the business says you know it's just
like

157
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:20,269
hypothetical monster that no one ever
knows no one can own security

158
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,829
and that brings me to my next point
which is a very favorite topic of mine

159
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:28,410
which is the CISO MCSO

160
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:34,559
for hats I mean for for CIS owes in CSS
today

161
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,309
there purely focused on business

162
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:43,300
let me ask a question does anybody here
have a technical CS own place

163
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,329
couple to that's great it's going to be
the the way for the future trust me

164
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,519
think about this you have business guys
running a security program rain

165
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,639
don't be like me saying hey the have
legal

166
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,709
you don't need any law experience
whatsoever to run the legal shop

167
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,930
you can just talk all business Ian when
court cases

168
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,259
or hey head of HR you probably don't
need an HR experience

169
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,790
or hear general you know you to do need
to be a troop

170
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,720
you need to know how to fire a gun you
mean I do a estar because you know

171
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,839
you disfigured on talk all business in

172
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,910
and so this year so since yesterday our
business folks not security folks

173
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,540
they do not know how to secure an
organization now again

174
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,139
%uh explain how this works in the second
but they buy in the binder binder binder

175
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,089
by any wonder why they have a breach

176
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,189
they do not fix things they buy things
they sell risk management programs and

177
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,029
GRC

178
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,059
in deal PN and APT

179
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,209
you know all these different bus times
whatever happened to be going on at the

180
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,329
arce conference at everybody else's song
that that year

181
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:52,959
is a terms that we use in order to you
build our programs up

182
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,290
and so we'll see about tech our business
savvy CISO since you're so does is we've

183
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,860
needed them for a while because we have
no idea how to talk

184
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,149
as security people we've never known how
to communicate to the organization s

185
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,920
explain what we're doing

186
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,069
what I can tell you is we don't need
them anymore

187
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:15,449
ross is your the next year so

188
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:20,670
mark my words you have to be the next
year so

189
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,279
if you are at risk route seriously

190
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,879
and think about it I mean where we at
right now in security

191
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,279
me were very immature industry

192
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,860
10 years we needed the business folks to
help us out nationally establishments or

193
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,869
security

194
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:39,629
now we can blow everything they did it
up and start from scratch initiative

195
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,029
right

196
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,860
and why say that is in on us when this
but

197
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,129
you look at the business and help
businesses make decisions

198
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:51,309
it is make decisions on what they know

199
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:54,519
I says hackers have a very tough time
communicating

200
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,600
anytime information about security to
where they feel comfortable love what

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,199
they know

202
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,959
and that's what the business guys can
make a minister in all these different

203
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,319
formulas and risk equations in

204
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,670
are GRC and all these are things to you
hopefully

205
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,529
changer for them rain when they were you
making decisions on security anymore

206
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,509
that point

207
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:15,649
risk the ferment seriously

208
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,170
I'm gonna transfer the rest to the
business really

209
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,529
is there going to secure organization in
any way shape or form

210
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,920
whole we need to do is communicate the
right now the easiest thing

211
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,720
is did the word the business just
communication

212
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,129
talking in the labor to the game
understand that's about it

213
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,629
and he may be saying hey how my
qualified say this

214
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:40,809
so here's how you guys know me right the
social engineer talk it

215
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:45,720
or the 10 the device order the $10,000
spots customized

216
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,179
you know or on some code that I rode or

217
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,220
me giving hugs the people or you know

218
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,100
me talking in front of people so I'm
hacker

219
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,240
right Chur we don't see

220
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,240
is that mean issue doing stuff like
meaning in biz in a meeting I actually

221
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,459
holding meetings and having meanings
within the organization

222
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,860
I'm you their CEO Garcia for every
single week I'm you there see on a

223
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,639
monthly basis

224
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,850
a report to the Board or sitting in

225
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,389
but really important news reaction make
decisions and stuff

226
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,550
I'm CSL a fortune 1000 company

227
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,029
I a budget with capital expenditures and
expenses

228
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm you to see if only get three
stitches the board I can I can talk

229
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,889
about that

230
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:33,379
we actually have a working security
program I can say they're

231
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,519
I miss you we actually fix things in the
organization

232
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,660
it's not perfect but we actually tackle
issues that are important to the

233
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,769
organization

234
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,129
you don't have this risk acceptance
model we don't have come a little risk

235
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,800
management processes

236
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,309
we are viewed as a business in Hanson in
the company

237
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:55,470
competition look at this is like wow
these guys are awesome

238
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,239
we need incorporate them into what we're
doing Ross we're screwed

239
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:05,129
we don't buy billions of dollars of
products we don't need 'em

240
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,619
we rely on people rely on the people in
the business

241
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:14,309
to help us we are our motto in in our
segment our company is a

242
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:18,869
securities a.m. an individual ever but a
team responsibility

243
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:23,809
and it's true holster within our entire
company we have funding

244
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:27,779
we have funding by ask 4 I get it

245
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,059
me but I said that kinda

246
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:37,410
songs going so here has agreed budget
staff

247
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,579
one imminent to many of us

248
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,220
so for those either don't have a great
budget and staff and wanna be next year

249
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,959
so sorry

250
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,989
like that I can help you with an in
Issaquah topical bridges

251
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:56,369
we are terrified of a breach and
security rain you look at breaches as

252
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:59,279
the most horrendous thing that can
happen

253
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,209
water is bridges can actually be a good
thing for your

254
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,519
it almost takes a breach any company for
something that actually move

255
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,059
actually inject security into the
culture most people I could care less

256
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:14,079
about security within the company

257
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,129
it takes it actually takes a culture
change or something like that the work

258
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:22,339
and so come to the realization in your
security for no matter how good you are

259
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,100
you'll never be on a per cent secure
period

260
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,939
in most cases a breach will not destroy
your company

261
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:33,129
there's been too that averages that

262
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,269
went down in under data data nor and

263
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:41,410
like 19 2006 was only two companies have
ever

264
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,319
proper bankruptcy you specifically
because a breach so most cases nine and

265
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,939
out on you not me breach at TJ Maxx is
reporting record number of

266
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:52,299
a profit right now if you look at their
their stock options like dip

267
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:56,100
will Rebecca recovered easy

268
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,790
so sometimes lol I also do you sometimes
a bridge isn't as bad as it sounds

269
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,059
you can help us so

270
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:08,839
you guys can get security budget
experience breach

271
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,230
I'm serious on a and socially two
options and experiencing a bridge

272
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,639
option 1 as you get popped yet Sox

273
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,559
can't really control it we use that
opportunity

274
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,589
to change the culture and the company
use that opportunity to make sure the

275
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,290
business understands how bad it hurts
when these type of things happen

276
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,679
because it's gonna be inevitable you're
never going to be a hundred percent

277
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,089
secure all time

278
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,399
and 98.9 percent you've already
experienced a breach just don't know yet

279
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,049
so experience that in use that for your
benefit don't be scared don't be like

280
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:46,220
man I'm so sorry I can protect
organization listen debit 103 F in years

281
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,329
to do this and this is what happens when
you don't

282
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,679
use it action to

283
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,679
which is probably most preferable a
similar to bridge

284
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,110
does it actually experiencing a bad one
you can also simulate for to penetration

285
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,649
testing

286
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,120
zulu years had a penetration test them
before

287
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,250
get us a question again in about three
minutes

288
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,280
a penetration test today annual about
about this and NP testers

289
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,430
not what is designed to be today's

290
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,390
penetration testers essentially a
vulnerability scan with validation

291
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,959
testing on top

292
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,590
which means that Iran scanners to deploy
to look at any type of

293
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,360
me are passing might have added eight er
a misconfiguration or something that

294
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
they've developed in their scanners

295
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,630
to detect a possible exposure and from
there

296
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,660
the penetration tester will go into next
with the Spurs reportedly that scanner

297
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,170
found

298
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,230
how is that a simulated breach

299
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,280
not thank you you that's awesome

300
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,140
participation

301
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,790
a penetration test is always been
designed and should have been always

302
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,530
design

303
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,990
to simulate a national Thacker simulate
a breach

304
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,000
and only thing that your company cares
about period

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,610
is its ability to generate revenue and
some penetration test should mimic that

306
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,330
how can I actually attacking
organization exploit them and hurt them

307
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,410
so that there they can no longer
generate revenue alright

308
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,990
impact the revenue so much that age is
really jacked up their company

309
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,760
that's what up and test designed to do
they're designed a seemly a bridge

310
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,240
period penetration test equals bridge
simulation

311
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,220
thats it similarly to breach you need a
jacket company up

312
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,590
bad macomb hurt you need to make her

313
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,350
she lost be able to show how you guys
should destroy their company and

314
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,520
in Chris nickerson seasonality in a on

315
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,640
he the specter believing arm he is the
the

316
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,410
the rationality of you know break into
GM does it was a better explanation I

317
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,380
can ever give but

318
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,460
no break in a GM you hack into a
manufacturing plant instead of them

319
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,060
making

320
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,600
GM products they start making for
products so

321
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,990
I mean that will check their company up
beyond you hit any type of

322
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,300
you know comparison you ever canvas art
trying to sell for products and from

323
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,379
from a GM made are manufacturing plant
because

324
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,970
millions have a different as an example
zedi my company you know future

325
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,990
projections

326
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,820
I'm schematic summer our product lines
are things like that are in were big

327
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,850
services company

328
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,950
so if you target any three of those
different types and

329
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,670
avenues you're gonna make us her and
that's what we do we target those

330
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,620
business units

331
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,460
to making show pain so again who hears
had a penetration test number four

332
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,730
hands went down quite a bit

333
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,550
and so let's look at

334
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,960
packing today if you look at the
evolution hacking Wii's

335
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,760
me someone start off with social
engineering we can I went to you

336
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,590
the network layer doing what operating
systems in with the web applications and

337
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,550
we serve a client side which Adobe still
getting hit and then

338
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,510
arm from there you know who knows if
it's any copying or whatever but it's

339
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,500
kinda back at the the social engineering

340
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,710
mom part right now and i wanna touch
briefly on the cloud every time

341
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,130
every time I see I have two drinks at
one right now as to you

342
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,220
so the cloud for me

343
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,820
is like taking a big chance and it's
like

344
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,550
going out there and throwing your data
somewhere we have no idea that have

345
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,640
controls in Iran and

346
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,380
and you just basically taking our data
moving out and this is the terms and

347
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,160
services

348
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,150
are taken from a cloud service provider
and why it is important because this is

349
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,120
pretty much identical in every saber and
form to any time a cloud service

350
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,870
provider the provider you go with

351
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,740
and saw misread a om the

352
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,590
read parts here that the service is free
of viruses or other harmful components

353
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,310
any content downloaded or otherwise
obtained through the use of the Service

354
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,930
download is

355
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,880
or at your own risk will be solely
responsible for any damage to your

356
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,700
computer system

357
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,500
and loss of data to result from such
down their own arm is also a part of it

358
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,760
here that I like is our

359
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,550
I unwrapped it or secure that any
defects or errors will be

360
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,460
be tracked in I mean it just it
basically dissolves the company any type

361
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,310
of legal liability whatsoever

362
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,550
for putting information officer from

363
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:18,040
in his clout in a swerving all over data
should have gone back about 10 years and

364
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,780
security with the cloud so what now

365
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,200
you look at

366
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,500
the future security we have a long ways
to go

367
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,800
when it comes to actually protecting
ourselves against

368
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,150
attacks against targeted attacks from
not anywhere near to be able to handle

369
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,320
even the most simplistic any sequence
action

370
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,880
is 13 years old with a teenager in your
if you go to any OS meeting or you go to

371
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,950
any web application security won the
first then they're talking about a

372
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,910
sequence action

373
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,750
thirteen-years-old buffer overflows are
before I was even born

374
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,810
no personal happiness

375
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,350
so we have a long ways to go

376
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,840
when it comes to actually
securitizations and it's gonna take a

377
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,020
real big fundamental shift

378
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,990
and how we're doing it and it's gonna
take technical people like us

379
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,560
to run it in my opinion there's there's
to roll type serve

380
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,720
love CISO czar CSR's you could have one
that's business Sep jerker focus that

381
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,070
can actually communicate

382
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,170
but he understands the technical
abilities are the people to actually

383
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,870
secure their organization

384
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,330
and so his only purpose is to be the
chief sales officer

385
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,090
all that guy does is forms of out to the
executives to get more funding

386
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,920
any less technical people build the
program to do what they need to do more

387
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,990
secure the organization

388
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,520
the second is the hybrid which is %uh us

389
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,130
the guys that are technical that
understand and agree to the ropes of

390
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,460
security

391
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,590
again as you start to secure
organizations but can also communicate

392
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,580
the same time it for you guys we need to
start talking to people

393
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,700
mara and talking their language

394
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,140
Sefo or CEO doesn't care about security
all they care about is a rest towards

395
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,250
the company

396
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,480
if you can shown in here interest to the
company they all

397
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,690
98.9 percent but I'm fixin because they
don't want to go down bernier

398
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,830
is all about communication so the future

399
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,880
it's really up to us could be this

400
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,040
quicker Sox it could be this

401
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,830
or you can step up and be the next year
so

402
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,200
thing that we need to do is we need
invest in our people and do some hard

403
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,429
work because technology is not going to
do for us

404
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:36,380
your magic product that is that box that
shiny in the closet that is your apt

405
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,520
preventer or your DLP Prevenar or
whatever it is that you're buying

406
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,100
is not gonna Fisher problems as
announcing that you don't need to buy

407
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,440
technology sometimes I mean

408
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,790
there's some really good technology out
there like a semi casual corley

409
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,050
essentially if what you do but where you
build on top of that as we start again

410
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,030
the meat and potatoes

411
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,450
things technology should use as an
enhancement to

412
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,640
a national program its miniature they
already have in their

413
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,740
you can automate some function on that
portion love

414
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,640
something that makes it even better in
most cases we cite a product and that's

415
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,950
our program right

416
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,620
orphanages impact change secure critical
assets the company

417
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,280
remove any type complexities you have
other throw away your risk for muscles

418
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,490
are bullshit

419
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:28,770
their bullshit risk formulas are
absolutely bullshit

420
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,460
they do nothing your company about one
attacker at three o'clock in the morning

421
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,000
is going to come in ACW

422
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,570
in or the fear-mongering what am i doing
well musher moderate seen

423
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,440
through a or five-year plans do you have
for security

424
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,590
and a secure stuff its

425
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,390
these thing that's a member for me is is
find out what your company does to make

426
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,070
money

427
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,150
just protect that as it the hairdo

428
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:00,040
think it's like I could I could mean by
five hundred thousand dollars for

429
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,650
from a big 5 to tell you that right
there is that other do in

430
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,650
invest in people guys and and technology
and get back to reality

431
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,970
has every day in my life

432
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,590
so that concludes my high level stuff

433
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,529
because as a caso I'm not a

434
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:29,759
just a CSM a technical person so I was
gonna she is breaking and shit so

435
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,809
arm so I want to show your

436
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,179
is it all their road which is new
version are now actually

437
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,509
called little thing called the social in
here talkin

438
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:42,539
and actually need to find mine well
tended to pressure a quick

439
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:47,009
but as anybody here use the social and
you're talking before the past it's good

440
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:47,429
to hear

441
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,220
maybe not firmly within reach and please
anyone know me know her so she undertook

442
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,519
a

443
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,590
great ca so

444
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,830
the social engineer talking for me is
probably the easiest way to break into

445
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,619
an infrastructure organisation

446
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:03,860
and why is that because humans are the
weakest link when it comes to you

447
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,570
penetration testing are now wifi a
million dollars in security that you

448
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,289
invested in your Sims right PS your
ideas your new hampshire whatever the

449
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:12,700
heck

450
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,090
ap Prevenar walser provider

451
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,419
all the stuff you guys bought when

452
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:22,999
I can just call somebody up impersonate
them first and somebody in the company

453
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,570
and having to come whenever I want to

454
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,749
and so I wrote this about two and a half
years ago or so

455
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:31,639
and it really has become a standard and
penetration testing as far as social

456
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:32,549
engineering gives

457
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,340
you guys aren't doing social engineering
as part of a penetration testing you're

458
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
really missing out

459
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,490
you're really missing a large Avenue
exposure that

460
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,629
probably is one the most significant
threats you have to face today I mean I

461
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:47,230
don't really even go for like

462
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,179
segal injection and I anymore I'd and
think about it like at Britain's your

463
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:51,749
days

464
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:54,779
before the guy user days in similar
stuff in

465
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,369
I don't wanna my computer and I'm
working on it but on you know

466
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,980
it'll take me about two weeks or so of
heavy fighting in reversing

467
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,619
and crafting an exploit up in bypassing
the witness protection mechanisms are

468
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:06,070
like that

469
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,710
Financial are in whatever I need to do
in order to you right that exploration

470
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,539
is too we saw frustration export running
a frustration for me

471
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:16,950
the pain in the butt and so two weeks

472
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,360
of doing this to an environment that I
hope

473
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,480
the other company has or that maybe I
just profiling and maybe a certain

474
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,019
subset the company has

475
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,110
in the hope that goes off they don't
have any others have a protection

476
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,529
mechanisms in place sucks

477
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:33,330
how long it takes to compromise in
organizational social engineering

478
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,649
a day and it's just me during my

479
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:41,700
dole you know diligence are trying to
understand your organization

480
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,740
how to make money a development pre-tax
income in assume

481
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,970
arm for social engineer so generally a
lot times lightning tens our favor one

482
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,509
for every like everybody uses it

483
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:55,320
and select elegant like the helpdesk for
example because urgently rotating door

484
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,309
with an accompanying their

485
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,720
you like to stay and help us for a
longer time people hate dealing with

486
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,600
customers in

487
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,720
and I raid you know people within the
company and so

488
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,389
you have new people coming in and out
helpdesk and so what i'll do is i'll go

489
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:09,470
on LinkedIn a look for the specific
company name

490
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,480
and others look at all the new employees
manager look for people that had

491
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,519
elevated privileges within the company

492
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,830
and all specific target them and so I'll
call them up auspey

493
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,409
main my phone number to appear like I'm
coming from inside the company

494
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,570
public am zone summer VP of Sales I'm
really trying to get this

495
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,360
website to work i've a two million
dollar you know polls online I really

496
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,080
need your help here we know can you help
me

497
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,029
and is a common technique with and
social engineers on anchoring which is

498
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:38,169
probably gonna uses once understand
India

499
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,619
but you know if i call someone essay hey
I'm vice president of sales I'm Sonso

500
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:47,119
I have a really big problem I just
planted in a car dude said Oh

501
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,129
hey these guys have for one isn't
importance but to you

502
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:54,000
this guy is in need of help I haven't
asked them yet for anything like that

503
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,389
but soon as I do is gonna do it Nepal
anchor

504
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:01,369
and is gonna help ya no matter what it's
very hard to get his democrats attacks

505
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:05,379
and so was set it couples technology

506
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:09,609
with the process of social engineering
and so well C back to you is

507
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:13,899
exports are great the fun there sexy
either awesome right

508
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:16,919
when you're targeting accompanied you
know they have a6

509
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,460
for ie7 or ie8 or Windows 7 64 bit or
Windows 7 32 bit or Windows XP or

510
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,309
Windows Vista

511
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,139
all these different variations that can
cause that's what not not to work

512
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:30,419
because there's rarely Universal exports
that work across the board because

513
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,000
they're very specific to memory address
spaces

514
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,639
within those individual operators
something even service packs

515
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:40,250
so why target those with exports anymore
I don't use 'em

516
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,340
don't use experts anymore haven't used
exploiting the penetration test when I

517
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,799
don't social engineering

518
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,629
in the longest time and reasoning is so
easy to use

519
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:52,690
things that are exploits that are
legitimate nature to do it

520
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:58,100
and so here set command line is also a
web GUI interface into a

521
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,659
and also to those few that that used
fast track in the past

522
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:05,720
IOM reported fast-track over into the
sand satins

523
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,639
class early so has all the attack
vectors with inset

524
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:14,509
now wanna do some slack the social
engineer attack everything okay

525
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,440
to as a budget different types of attack
occurs in here there's the

526
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,460
adrenal based actors website act like a
spear phishing wireless access point at

527
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,119
factors SMS moving

528
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:28,090
on a talented London Times attack
vectors in my favor won by default as

529
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,730
the website attack vector

530
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,840
and what was attacked by two dozen im
any use my favorite

531
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,570
portion would you have to read gradual
harvester which kresa harvester you can

532
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,359
go on klone anyone so you want to

533
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,590
it automatically read the post premise
for you and reject them back to your

534
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,379
site for sin and redirect them back to
legitimate site

535
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:48,970
so they never knew they were there so
you'd still our credentials from other

536
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,240
one is a job applicant ac

537
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,330
because everybody has job install and a
job Apple isn't

538
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,970
an exploit I can write whatever
malicious Java applet I want to you

539
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,789
and deployed on to become senior full
access person she wants a quick run

540
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:05,639
and a lot of stuff but I don't know that
really pisses people off a date would we

541
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:07,070
have to hit run

542
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,359
Ross they had like task ill II x4
hermosillo whatever because it doesn't

543
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,169
let them

544
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:16,519
so it's goin' slut that and since I
don't have internet access right now

545
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,559
on issues or is what template but you
could use the cyclone which you can

546
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,720
spawn any web so you want to make a
difference

547
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,720
and ago in New web templates and others
use Gmail's an example

548
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,149
and shipping it you're gonna

549
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:37,640
C

550
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,990
and giving it some to do all this icon

551
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:50,990
one second

552
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,210
to go into what's attacks java app works
like Warner

553
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,970
at school gym so on ago

554
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,380
read Gmail pullback reread everything
they possibly can

555
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,220
and then set you up a fake web server
that everything's are working there

556
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,309
now this is the corp are the new the new
version

557
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,549
senator is a new version of our Senate's
version 2.2 and I have a bugfix

558
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:22,769
so it's been about two months trying to
figure out this blog and I happen to

559
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:26,240
have an idea as I was writing the train
system over coming here and I end up

560
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,250
facing it some really happy about that

561
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,250
and what this new attack for to does
does does a much different as a payload

562
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:32,980
you can use

563
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,210
the one that a bill for Sat it's a
completely arm

564
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,870
custom our river shell basically even
has a lot of features like bypass you

565
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,269
see keystroke logging

566
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:44,690
arm as s is reversed tunneling are

567
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,750
in RTP all those two types of things are
already built into it

568
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,309
ready is one arm that thomas was born is
a developer on the the talk at

569
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:55,509
and this purely communicate over HDPE
natively

570
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:59,299
so thin it should be based protocol that
communicate over TCP in HDPE

571
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,620
Bass Pro cause hearing in ATP inspection
to get around that

572
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,190
on then you also have on the ability to
use any of the

573
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,110
Metasploit payloads now was the problem
with most were payloads

574
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,019
especially gave you guys know is it
gently Africa banners regards what

575
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:15,740
happened in coding using stuff like that

576
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,000
and a city bus different Rick sturckow
grab a mess by payload I do P accident

577
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,399
obviously UP actually

578
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,570
iran denies it quite a bit and then I
would on news on dr Stevens technique of

579
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,500
importing any

580
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,730
microsoft digital certificate into that
execute a ball

581
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,740
making it look like it was a Microsoft
signed: execute a ble

582
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,440
and that guy of around for a longer time
than a surgeon's more on that

583
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,409
and the latest version I put in our show
code exactly as I me from their shock at

584
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:42,909
exec

585
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:47,730
com people's skin arm shoko tech is a
small secure both like 5k

586
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,730
and all does it takes an argument and
you can inject

587
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,950
of America show coach a into memory
however haven't touched desk

588
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,230
such a smart a cute about that that
create basically uses red process memory

589
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,379
to you load a bunch of Neosho Kercher
into memory in it

590
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:05,559
creature major for Shell so that's also
in here but the cost for now the job

591
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,240
happened I'm shows you know user

592
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,250
show called execuse an example but with
the newest version upset

593
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,750
it does something really unique as again
in Matthew

594
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,950
Graber who figure out a way to

595
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:25,649
inject show kosher into memory for
PowerShell and so I rewrote the job ap

596
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,109
lit

597
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:30,980
to automatically detect on power shows
install and so soon as a quick run on a

598
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,079
job applicant effective partials their

599
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,250
it drops a completely custom on
PowerShell commands

600
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,270
onto the system that shoots mentor
percent memory never touches desi don't

601
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,760
have to worry bout

602
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,770
antivirus ever again ever no its cool
about this

603
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,419
as Regatta is image from a partial and
execution restriction policies

604
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:52,730
right so and Afghan 16

605
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,429
the guy I Josh Kelley myself we present
on how to bypass execution restriction

606
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,079
policies

607
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,920
in are you doing this document is like
now it's on a hacker anything

608
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,410
but we do is you take bomb your scripts

609
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,869
make shirts in one line so we can be
multiple lines can actually be

610
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:11,310
you know a pic script it on one line
unico to

611
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,530
you basically for encoder and the past
the encoded command parameter PowerShell

612
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,250
that allows you to sensual execute
gossip what I profess his research and

613
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,220
policy in place

614
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,560
so even if you're using the most
restrictive execution restriction policy

615
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,260
it bypasses and largest to execute
whatever you want to and the Machine

616
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:34,260
I'll give an example that nanosecond in
just to show you what it looks like

617
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,250
Apple attack does the system right here

618
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,160
right up there this is the encoded
string

619
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,880
%uh the PowerShot ac and so what happens
is

620
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,920
the index additional whatever website
you tryna

621
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,359
trying to you on klone katherine ann ads
primers on to the next page

622
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,940
and in a job app hold on Paul's
Preminger so it's unique every time

623
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,849
and it's good for Mac is he Asian
perspective to and Solapur those

624
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:09,609
parameters

625
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:13,400
and then at a lecture on the partials
the Tekken here's can with the code

626
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,770
looks like a little bit as far as the
partial stuff goes from Matt

627
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:22,190
is me so

628
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,200
here he just Tom you know basically is
an add-on that libros was

629
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,680
arm leveraging power shelter enumerate
kernel32.dll an atmosphere TR

630
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,350
CRT a DLL and then he goes in polls

631
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:39,480
arm shuttle premise here and there's two
best offer 64-bit 32-bit

632
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,610
it then interesa page sizes to that and
then injected into memory

633
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:48,200
and create a process for so never
touches desk not change is ron so that's

634
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,140
one line verses

635
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:56,140
many

636
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,860
some to go to website

637
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,250
you can see here that a look in feel
ever wish you perform as

638
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,960
gmail pops up change my appearance

639
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,450
obverse

640
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,520
a still process should yeah

641
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,670
issue to kill this bill process which
began that's the listener

642
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:32,530
out

643
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,960
are 29 at Madras as well I gotta

644
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,570
excess I so

645
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,020
we get gmail a pop so no one thing and
it's kinda funny is om

646
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,590
know if you cancel and they got an
amazing pestering

647
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,590
pops back up again

648
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,970
began even in a group in the game cause
a browser it's really f'ing annoying

649
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,840
and Om and so the driver Peter so
they're gonna click on the matter what

650
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,370
but but maybe more believable

651
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,410
about a year and a half ago when I came
out as a tack

652
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,680
you get signed the publisher name with
whatever you want to

653
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,360
using cell site ourself sign coaching
search right and so

654
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,580
after they get kinda popular people like
holy crap you can sound like Microsoft

655
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,140
and Google mean a real believable

656
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,480
Java like you know got really taken
basically than update

657
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,000
about six months ago that shows a big
unknown in the publisher feel

658
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,050
so what I did was I just went in
registered an LLC in the state of Ohio

659
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,770
Calder

660
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,150
my publisher and I bought a code signing
certificates

661
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,480
Go Daddy so you know the applications as
a singer has been verified the one on

662
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,360
the application

663
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,100
yeah sure of course any notice defaults
to always trust country from the

664
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,720
publisher

665
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,060
thrill trusting so soon as a hit-run

666
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,740
and as a lot a mathematical equations is
going on right now to calculate the show

667
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,250
code

668
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,820
arm in a sizable you see here now I'm
get my payload

669
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,600
offer partial you see here that I camera
chopper show and as migrating from

670
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,650
process partial to know that now

671
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,360
for a compromise version about every in
touch this through the job app with

672
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:21,360
am

673
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,260
now the second attack on Sharia let me
get my a handler of

674
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,089
as the 10 the attack as a visionary tens
is a mean after the 10 Z

675
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:35,789
good that's good rehashing mucho all
tough

676
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:42,789
miss get the Center for a bit

677
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,039
alright source

678
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,790
here

679
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,370
type a slow and

680
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:01,400
with the tens years says the computer
chip here to differ miles it in the post

681
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,940
close-knit into smaller size

682
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,060
that's the thing we're you can buy a
frumpy RJC dot com

683
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,890
and thereabouts are now 13 bucks or so

684
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,630
and what's unique about this is it's it
you can leave whenever you want to she's

685
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,770
using ordering a programming language so
it's got small processor in your number

686
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,350
memory

687
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,520
what's cool about it is it emulates a
mouse and a keyboard

688
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,570
that's why it's important is the
bypasses Arun

689
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,270
you plug it in at MIT keyboard has a
more stores I think about things that

690
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,020
you can do

691
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,160
with that thing you downloader and stuff
like that which is gonna call

692
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,690
all we did is we are we took our went to
Best Buy me about a hundred our keyboard

693
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:39,350
but to 'em

694
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,430
miss keywords like the best keyboard
ever seen lighting is god-like

695
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,740
iTunes hook in with the much like really
nice liza back and you know it's got me

696
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,610
on my stuff

697
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:53,010
we senator to that guys and I T and we
did is we modified first we open up the

698
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,580
keyboard

699
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,200
we started the citizen in mind device
and so the key word goes through this

700
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,530
first and then out to

701
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,710
national symbol sending and what happens
is every time he goes through here

702
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,080
reset the counter right here okay so
some Press third letter D

703
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,590
de coser he repeated the back to its
original keyboard

704
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,920
and reset the counter all we did is

705
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,420
we if we detected about five minutes
been activity

706
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,140
in move the mouse up one pixel to left
so this means there is a kick on you'll

707
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,850
notice that

708
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,910
must moving and we waited about are

709
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,260
eight to nine hours have an activity so
when they're at home or away from the

710
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,180
other key word right

711
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,200
and what we found is we can deploy
payload at that point andropov a binary

712
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,470
at the system to this guy

713
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:39,180
and fully customize it without them ever
knowing about another funny part about

714
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,700
as a senator to itis

715
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,140
mean I'm getting four shells back in
four different people

716
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,460
so my guess is like that artery I see
guys going to cause they're jealous

717
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,510
about the new keyboards

718
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,710
which is what we do nineteen we still
good stuff and

719
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,940
so there he know surprise on our mission
at the gay stuff

720
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,950
no mystery a although the demo this

721
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,330
and this is using other new version a
set has the on PowerShell

722
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:07,910
mechanism on its you can drop this
interpreter into memory now there's also

723
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,250
no technical used to you

724
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,430
on the show got executive shocker exec
on over its hexadecimal

725
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,100
an alright its operating system and I
recovered it back to binaries impartial

726
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:23,390
so I just read a small parcel stop that
reason robberies in binary mister reason

727
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,370
hacks in rates are a binary it's really
easy

728
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,920
and Zara lighter disk drive a minor at
the system's much you want you

729
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,140
and the problem with only 10 zzzz art
has arm

730
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,780
yes storage capability our stores
limitations %um 64k stored on a

731
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,290
so we saw turn SD card to your own
native as the drivers into it so that

732
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,070
attendee native leary's the SD card and
doesn't mounted as an SD card storage

733
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,820
device

734
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,920
you can have as much room as you want to
you unattended device itself

735
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,070
another thing we did too is said
actually I copy it over just

736
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,150
reading I'm tired binary special art one
takes for ever we wrote a small stage

737
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,670
for that opens up a comp or entrance
through treachery initialize itself back

738
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,130
as a

739
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,390
as a comment after in transit or be
accom- so dry it drops of a multi

740
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:06,940
seconds

741
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,360
now here's this poppin

742
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,530
watch the match now you can make this
black guy I'm working on the the black

743
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,210
ok own

744
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,740
I gotta from garland on my good buddies
and a

745
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:25,880
has run a partial commanding code in
tonight I've been

746
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I have a cairo is open if the wireless
and it's almost done

747
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,199
so it'll go and execute so executes

748
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:43,619
now overshadowing over here we can
interpret Shaw

749
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:48,630
but I ran the first disc Jamaica

750
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:55,630
so

751
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,850
good with all this and a lot more than
what I can show you but running out I'm

752
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,980
unfortunate luck will serve on a ship
fast track

753
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,470
on but nasa say this article stop other
you can do

754
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,540
if you look at my presentation one train
explain is

755
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,820
is not all bad we have a lot to get
things coming out love industry

756
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:16,620
it's just we have a lot of work to do
because we're such an immature industry

757
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,080
we have so much work to do in order to
fix our our companies and actually

758
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,100
protect against 'em

759
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,180
that it's gonna require a major change
in how we're currently doing things

760
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,940
cause major change who are in charge of
things in order to actually meet the

761
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,870
demands of what we're doing today and
security

762
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:38,870
the many questions so how did you

763
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,030
um addressed the issue of

764
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,660
security or just general quality from

765
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,410
like developers or the like

766
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:55,120
companies that use to you know program
store for you

767
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,210
and the question yep so it's question
was how did you address the

768
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,210
our mission is a concern drown things
that you program either internally or

769
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,390
you have outside

770
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,060
enemies our program for you as well
correct run application security

771
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,720
rate race level eso

772
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,690
what we did is arm for my company we
have developed shops or a place we are

773
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,320
places in India we have places

774
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,740
on in I am r-ohio facilities where
places in

775
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,940
arm Florida and what we end up doing is

776
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,070
we got injected so you look at who does
a soft lawn company

777
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:32,140
usually fall follows up to some BP and
then down to some

778
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,900
multiple are people on it kinda spread
out from there and so we had to BP up

779
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,520
first

780
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,260
and what we did is we injected ourselves
from the very early conceive men

781
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,170
other suffered on the life cycle so soon
as a new application a new version a new

782
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,280
something comes alive

783
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,580
were involved from the very beginning a
bit and then throughout the entire

784
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,790
suffered on the life cycle we're very
much involved

785
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,760
and so if you look at the National
developers we work very close to them on

786
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,130
a regular basis and ensuring that the
QoS quality

787
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,490
now in addition have to go through
yearly mandatory you education awareness

788
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,140
training right

789
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,410
we did ours differently we show our
developers how to hack

790
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:08,750
and so the headers testing by returning
don't penetrate things amish on 101st

791
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,250
code shown how you know how to actually
letter segal Jackson cover nice things

792
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,230
that's our user awareness because we
figured average good how about a much

793
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,100
more security stuff and I can really
care

794
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,880
the cash hack your own stuff we actually
use our life are hurled applications

795
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,770
have sought to do it arm

796
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:27,030
so you know it it's been kinda a
two-fold approach to that

797
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,000
but then before it ever listen
production we work family of source code

798
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,890
analysis and dynamic testing and we do

799
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,260
before to release in a daze a production
what we've seen is

800
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,160
we rarely have on any type of large
exposures usually minor things that

801
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,870
they've missed

802
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:43,210
I'm so we've seen a significant
reduction paper of it and almost

803
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,120
non-existent so sequence action

804
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,660
army Crossett scripting the things that
we start run into a little bit here and

805
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,050
there are more permission at I
attributes in

806
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,590
and things that affect so it's been
pretty pretty good just from that part

807
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:58,250
when it comes to actually outsourcing
their code we don't do it

808
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,250
we have in moved to the model of
outsourcing code development outside in

809
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,250
specific because it's a rest their
organization

810
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,900
are we find out if we move our code
outside to someone India or China or

811
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,750
things like deja

812
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,420
rate per much just echoed by exits
religious guy in your daughter property

813
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,080
and gone

814
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,570
and so is a decision a while back not to
do that I'll this

815
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,990
it was this is between us and the VP
that handles that the bomb inside a bit

816
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,150
and so we've been pretty successful in
mom

817
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,440
at least application security and
maturing as opera life cycle tours

818
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,060
premature

819
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,940
very question no questions

820
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,930
well they said

821
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:37,630
time figure much
