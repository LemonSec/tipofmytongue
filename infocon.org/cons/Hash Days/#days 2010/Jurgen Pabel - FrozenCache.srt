1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,250
absolve thank you for coming obviously
the other

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,350
at work talk is very interesting a say

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,309
over there yeah probably go over there
for

4
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:20,169
um please ask questions anytime

5
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:23,210
is raise your hand and I'll his request

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,769
if you wanna wait to the end of so

7
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,970
'em our security on the island

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,040
this love is really in their because it
needs to be slight

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,059
all um

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,620
I'm not above the issue

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,899
for you know example thanks a in case

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,000
in and heard about it or normal that
much about it and

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,110
talk about it what it really is him and
I'm going up

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,559
talk about a above a solution for

15
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,359
from cash and lemme also it then I'll

16
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,649
middle name and

17
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,310
questions up so

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,890
on called wouldn't think with the

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,229
a.m. research does them I'll

20
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,240
to three years ago and when they a

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,860
sounds that a contrary to common belief
that you

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,140
are take power away from a computer then

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,479
up data in RAM not immediately

24
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,920
be raise rather will fade over time

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
and on a couple seconds column

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,130
but it can be and up minutes by corning

27
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,300
so up the the cold cold

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,300
if the really apply to do not call said

29
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,569
your computer but rather to cooling
memory the ranchers

30
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:53,110
and they've achieved %uh 10-minute
period with a

31
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,679
Stone cover: significant or of the
member so

32
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,789
'em when they folder

33
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,840
they combine that with the the

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,840
the knowledge that

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,030
when you have a for this bankruptcy or
any for

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,480
software a software needs to keep the

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,620
Christian ummm I'll well

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,330
this is a curious even if you have a lot
of computer

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,680
um were using for this conclusion and

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,510
so will not be able to get it for Julie
logging in or anything

41
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,100
they can now on uses

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,630
packed they got the memory cooler than
the

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,960
but in a different computer room um

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,260
you know runs a problem expect whatever
data memory

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,790
and so

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,530
carton for me just got lucky on

47
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,420
that up wasn't really that new research
I'll answer

48
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,510
ten years ago there was a paper or work
done by the end

49
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,130
at Rd founders I'll is

50
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,730
that that number doesn't mean

51
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,860
UK all on what was you

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,520
in this research was that it was bitten
by software

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,670
with %um reviews so

54
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,390
up and wasn't worth noting is the bus to

55
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,040
other the right which is program that

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,140
on as to I'll be refreshed every so
often

57
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,510
to to not lose there so rests on

58
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,840
other man replies there's that a

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,610
and they they are not really for

60
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,950
you know used a.m. as you remember well

61
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,160
on the solution to this affects
Americans

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,209
well as 65 some

63
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,160
you cash which sits inside the the gym
as living here

64
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,360
and leave everything else I'll a member

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,020
so on when you

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,510
try to five-year the infection are there

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,160
you will love you get to the
cryptographic key because

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,380
when you they held in memory

69
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,440
it's not a member and you can really get
to the key that

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,870
cash because there's no if read out
cached

71
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,110
other and also when you with that

72
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,169
you the casket sprays on huge

73
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,250
nation really my knowledge

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,530
nawaz again that they know that UK

75
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,820
so on

76
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,200
because I'm really mine is other

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,870
the 2533 his see congress

78
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,870
and huge game talk about I'll hormones

79
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,930
used in certain issues who is a I'll
lead

80
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,669
was replacement so at one point in this
talk is a

81
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,169
you know we are having issues with
memory controller initialization

82
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,230
because at all is low-level on

83
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,550
cousin called that needs to be
implemented for every

84
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,690
motherboard everything every member
control and that's all

85
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,160
really low-level custom

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,110
that's only for them avoids using memory
memories there yet

87
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,660
soul the we're looking for a solution to

88
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,900
sort of even their way out of this
complexity and what they

89
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,830
I'll I guess discovered is that you can

90
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,760
switch to cash in

91
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,970
for Mon them %uh you can use the cash

92
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,820
as memory am the cash taxes will not

93
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,130
sort of I'll in gym soul

94
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,730
what they do is they on agreement
discussions remote

95
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,130
and then as standards he called to do
whatever

96
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,280
on up they need to do up to initialize
the memory controller

97
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,450
of there some love or that need to be
done there but

98
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,540
for the most part a it brought them
possibly

99
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,710
so they don't have to you know you

100
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,710
every sorta aspect of warning them

101
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,530
um when trying to fight this

102
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,010
do security in terms of try to keep them

103
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,310
in cash only it gets a lil

104
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,010
tree so on there were some

105
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,290
John on also face England looking at
this

106
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,500
first one is that um x86

107
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,100
really have no cash management so to say
when you

108
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,460
as software try want to know about
what's in the cashless

109
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,130
they don't the cash on wanna cash left
been flushed

110
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,150
and all that there's really not much
there

111
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,270
so but you have to home

112
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,880
you know find a way to make sure that

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,190
would you put in the cash really will
not

114
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,010
automatically be perfect mem and

115
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,490
on thats um sort of

116
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,600
what from I get from the cash is remote
is that it'll behave like that

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,000
but you know obviously %um

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,620
security scenario here you want pitcher
will

119
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,730
my first approach was too just refresh

120
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,250
the moving over there into the cash
periodically

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,080
soldiers in KC it does get pushed out
Baggins

122
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,990
that game a hoe well I love you

123
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,530
better way and I'll came up with the
idea of

124
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,050
tricking the cash into polling data for

125
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,560
memory address that isn't there on the
system so if you have

126
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,650
maybe judy RAM then you have the
opportunities

127
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,020
where the year she had

128
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,070
address cash that trusted shove them you
know

129
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,220
you the very controlled no I can do that

130
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,460
a little never on northern

131
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,039
but rather orbin didn't work

132
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
I just could not get the cash to accept
data

133
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,700
were that wasn't the so

134
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,419
on if any you you know our

135
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,440
like a low-level see mishandling maker

136
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,050
that knows anything about this any
others

137
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,050
so on

138
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,750
second challenge is well with you

139
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,120
try to keep data and cache

140
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,190
and obviously you over his

141
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,130
the cash register G the most common data
nearby this review zones

142
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,490
faster on actors and if you sort of

143
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,860
say OK on keep just is then and there
then

144
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,690
your computer slow and I'll show you a
little ill get

145
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,010
so on one of the issues you

146
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,480
because on there really isn't any
fine-grained control

147
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,470
on using cast you you cannot just say
okay

148
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,490
freeze the long yes but keep the love to
catch going

149
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,550
on that's all on-chip known as

150
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,050
and there's Danielle any conservation
options

151
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,490
%uh the process provide are

152
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,630
what could be done is maybe many

153
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,060
level 3 cache if the chipset

154
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,560
bring by the a

155
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,070
on but nudging a looked just yet so

156
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,330
obviously with this and are being so

157
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,240
Anderson with performance on the
question is

158
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,880
okay of me minimize the effect of

159
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,940
lovers bars activate the the mall

160
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,390
much really is useful so if you're
having this is the

161
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,740
running that is greenlaw their only

162
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,580
to projector Keegan's would so

163
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,990
on part 1 only activated on its

164
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,260
really sent on and for that

165
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,150
to the front I'm use reblogged and when
your computer goes into standby

166
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,700
I mean standby else's bed where all urs
Corp

167
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,560
so and nothing

168
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,230
newsweek in not only keep the group your
memory

169
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,640
in at but also the most come

170
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,760
called so that of these some parts of
work sea views %um

171
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,060
articles are you there about feeling

172
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,110
that a all is

173
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,350
really a lot of work in progress so a
good

174
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,040
and to a lesser charge

175
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,420
there's an issue with the the keys of

176
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,180
you doing okay I'm a Christian he said

177
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,670
up 32 bytes okay I just need to keep the
third

178
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,010
by met in the day well as other through
goes

179
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,320
internally a lot of up grisham

180
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,680
work where they and on the who drove

181
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,390
cue that everybody's and your life other

182
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,040
is from the they then use for the group
B group in itself

183
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,550
all the keys goodall so you nominee

184
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,060
not only worry about 32 but he

185
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,120
al-sabah all these drive keys was if you
have those

186
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,170
you expect those they're just as good as
the master keys

187
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,220
say there the one being applied and
Butler you have

188
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,140
during the confrontation you have all
these you may be right there

189
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,380
that maybe you could want to do some

190
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,570
girls key you cannot samples

191
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,360
so the solution for this is

192
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,010
okay was implement girls that whenever

193
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,220
the up the software component those all
the

194
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,680
the distinction able dog

195
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
the investors for that eventuality and
whenever i switch to you

196
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,730
mode on then at all a certain that this

197
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,680
they've got into the red cash so

198
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,130
I'm s fairly easy if you're worried
about the

199
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,350
you that the his

200
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,950
the encryption key that is fairly easy
for the he's getting all those little

201
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,560
bit more

202
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,710
distributed but that's really hard the
any

203
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,050
meteor because you don't know where it
is might be some variable that

204
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,710
a items that during the computation
might be something that the

205
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,550
implementation

206
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,170
him so that really have to come down to
eighty

207
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,900
for implementation Pacific Solution

208
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,110
whereas the others up and these were

209
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,820
the the interstate love where you're
saying okay this is Mike Boehm

210
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:14,400
for provides them crash and

211
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,180
I'm flying on market

212
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,240
double so 1 I'll show you

213
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,750
is essentially on of activated

214
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,640
I'll me integrated uses them bus

215
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,150
a.m. it's not perfect yet so we'll
provide the same

216
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,290
the protection that 'em talk about but

217
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,880
inslaw's phones what really

218
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,470
of and I'm in the year

219
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,000
has proposed of at all the source code

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,040
on I'm not there yet yet

221
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,250
if you wanna see if you can go through
it on

222
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,310
if not them you know

223
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,920
is will though

224
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,140
where he is um you measuring approx
filesystem

225
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,670
and if I'm right ones with

226
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,320
elected by the mod and fuzz uracil

227
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,320
yet amid love you know

228
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,430
to

229
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,440
C

230
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,089
you

231
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:45,089
didn't enable striker

232
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,400
okay

233
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,050
as always um more

234
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,200
so what should have happened

235
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,200
is that the activation and when that
happens

236
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,489
here

237
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:12,579
on is that the maybe

238
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,879
as RAM methods activated and

239
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,699
on them all the keys that are rather
than

240
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,939
are them to the cash and the cash then

241
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,949
is problems although love the new normal

242
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:30,109
perch the cash so

243
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:33,189
I have no clue what were I'll

244
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:36,290
what was that like that on

245
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,619
performance was you type in the letter

246
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:44,160
only about half that online up

247
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,549
solve the level here love you

248
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:50,660
of your screen and if you move your
mouse for

249
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,689
for them as boss to come up

250
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:56,769
take about 10-15 seconds of Sweden

251
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,389
anything you could you know make usable
on

252
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,549
and the

253
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:07,879
were use the form adding you

254
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,129
I'm because of cash and over

255
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:16,049
so have

256
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:19,480
is arm for testing

257
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,910
on I created slalom some you both

258
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,169
their I'll will activity trolls

259
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:35,169
as mountains loss so that

260
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,720
though when israel %uh goes on his
previous column

261
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,100
and I'll buildings activate the modem

262
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,019
and I'll all the women

263
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,480
when largest region

264
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,209
go back for them implement so

265
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:59,049
our users were school Ali

266
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:02,389
okay so what up

267
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,779
on is on there's as well

268
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:12,779
them

269
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,059
there

270
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,939
you know the the ground at Goldman
writing

271
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,559
kernel module and 'em will initialize

272
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,069
the subcomponents on the car has grown

273
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,600
are %um for will initialize the

274
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,779
this conversion module and the reason
that

275
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,929
the for model

276
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,769
is that the what's that necessary to
invoke the

277
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,820
Mon or the registration 'em

278
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,200
I really found no Lee known really

279
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,649
good way to at that dynamically

280
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:56,509
ASM maybe rewriting function on or
something like that that all the time

281
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,879
look too good so what it is I copy the
Andrew

282
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,059
model them part

283
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,340
in this model and in order to

284
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,639
activate this model it and they close
the the improved

285
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,049
and on this model and provider for

286
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,879
the here sure and of course the

287
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:20,100
progress provide you or everywhere even

288
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,100
nerd so the

289
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,200
%um group model

290
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,980
is really just play the only thing that
attitude

291
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,259
really reno are on calls to the

292
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:38,480
the function that registers the Evans

293
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,619
of energy that needs for actively
activity

294
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:46,309
passions run wild and I'll uses

295
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:51,240
inside a function the functions that if
we can get in from the outside

296
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,129
on another model so you could look up
the

297
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:58,200
the events of it in the kernel and then
Johnson few

298
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,360
Nadia if you know the

299
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,869
the header a format and then try to

300
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:08,360
maybe page sometimes barging into it or
anything like that but

301
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,730
as Israel good practice so adding these
guidelines will

302
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,059
essentially a.m. till the

303
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,570
own model where he is are with

304
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,940
was but on the master in Group G

305
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,530
on of the the the derive

306
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:34,530
he's or your here so

307
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,659
past Ronald really love working growth

308
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,020
on deliberate overall he's that

309
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,290
I have and on

310
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,080
up insertion of other Paso everything in
the past

311
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,320
validated so you have a really
interesting cash

312
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,240
that stocked with and by

313
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,510
switching on the a non-durable

314
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,570
the she likes watching you sure that
nothing else happens while you run

315
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,090
through the

316
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,530
sold by accessing the on

317
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,850
data will automatically be added to the
cash and

318
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,270
on what I do is would take the heat

319
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,610
loaded into some registers wife of them
every

320
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,940
think the the key right back into the

321
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,540
the cash am them

322
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,680
you is actually good reason right there

323
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,870
sold for coffee

324
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,940
the he and the past

325
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,540
on I use as the registers because
they're big provide
