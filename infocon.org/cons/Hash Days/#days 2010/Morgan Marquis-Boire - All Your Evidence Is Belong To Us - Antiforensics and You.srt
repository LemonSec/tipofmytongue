1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,680
like before I guess it's not actually I
will talk a little bit about you guys

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,059
a so it is anyone here I'm

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,830
ever done any a princess I just

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,240
goal me what you actually like official
forensics dude

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,100
Bay in here law enforcement

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,410
10 minutes Bay I'm

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,859
what was lost and not risk-free got so
yeah

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,739
thank you at like I'm just just just
didn't know it yet so I'm

9
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,159
FBI I'm sachet

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,799
its pocket I'm like Iran you Zealand's
best anonymous remember

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,350
I love their best publicly available
hacking lappy

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,659
yeah go ahead bosses try to learn stuff

13
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:56,129
the public reciting the split i havent

14
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,360
miss a thing again sofa love me and i
got a job for a while I i'm

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,840
looked after and you're gonna website
and in for a while I looked up to 'em

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,219
giant supercomputer which was which the
industry's main hall which is used to be

17
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,149
the race

18
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:16,149
a I helped organize

19
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,990
risky because of its may have been a
couple waits for anyone is gonna get

20
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,090
down there are people here a few minutes
because I'm

21
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,509
I Met Art and he said that I know how
much if it is to put on a call for Assad

22
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,899
like to give a shout out to the ashtrays
guys this is this is looking to be

23
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:30,429
awesome

24
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:34,140
a less hell yeah

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,200
somewhat its maze arrest records here

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,460
own like yes what the heck spacing

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,759
Island white sea bass members finally
have a low also split like Efes and I it

28
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,530
might cross

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,799
these days as a security industry shows
Chris pointed out

30
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,090
%uh I up to a drink in certain spots

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,289
on so I have a slightly different
detention packing

32
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,969
but alive after everyone does for the
purposes

33
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:05,039
lo que maintaining I don't write access
to a computer system I'll

34
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,970
and I A this on being there is a little
better in school

35
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,840
but for legal reasons I keep it
specifically Bay I'll

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
i cud possibly talk to specific suicide

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,239
you need drugs thought it was a five
year after this yeah

38
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,209
there's also some vets in the software
obviously releasing code

39
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,640
I am would because rates vary the
purpose

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,379
all to look such as in the case jurors
mechanisms also

41
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,280
given that I am nominally a responsible
guy these days

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,659
a all the techniques that i'm gonna talk
about yet are the ones that

43
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,769
other than publicly talked about a lot
one could in

44
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,599
with a modicum of common sense %uh
sounds like they are not related to be

45
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,000
to do bad stuff so it's so

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,209
anywhere tonight I'd like to talk about
as friends

47
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,330
and this isn't just applicable for I am

48
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,980
pack as Black Cats isn't what I this is
actually

49
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,730
very applicable for a large corporates
I'll like that's all because I

50
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,920
destruction

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,239
not destruction and docile regis
outsiders lodges prices actually quite a

52
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,150
big deal these days

53
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,260
I'll I think every so often you hear %uh
statistics about how many laptops the US

54
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,239
military loses

55
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,500
what is up on you know a forensics is
actually quite important

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,459
in disguise upside to the liz has large
corporate activists

57
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,510
not alone up with you I'm lucky enough
to live

58
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,159
in a place where you have a government
that lights the torch people disagree

59
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,650
with them

60
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,519
this is over it will on edgier look
people just care about privacy invaded

61
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,799
people who can send copyright legal
issues political thinkers

62
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,269
a and also of course trains analysts

63
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,920
on its importance to examine

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,060
him %uh knowledge from both sides the
field something that

65
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,620
has sunk in a long time ago and
interesting industry other mister

66
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,370
breaking into a system that uses

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,480
security as one that's you know quite
well established

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,959
I it's not quite so common with forensic
analysts so

69
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,850
a lot of those talks from the
perspective of someone finds you avoided

70
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,850
isolate of risk analyst on

71
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,660
so when I she saying I tried to avoid of
some kind of panelists

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,790
United Airlines the a only in

73
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,020
so you up 36 is a field which
encompasses scientific methodology

74
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,730
about up effects being ascertained gotta
sit at the feet

75
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,300
not affect physical item typically maybe
schools

76
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,620
%uh generally this is very specific
patients

77
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,680
I'll wheels are stuff on Christians in
order to come up with convincing

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,810
narrative about me %uh so with people
approaching

79
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,870
where they turn I'll we did they do this
how they did

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,000
and generally like why did they does
money

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,180
video by individual plots social

82
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,490
on so in legal cases computer forensics

83
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,840
is very commonly used to analyze
computer belonging to the defendant

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,780
I am however this additional used to

85
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,260
recovered OSA maybe it's the I we also
provide air

86
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,160
the analyzing computer outbreak I

87
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,550
gotta get evidence against an employee
bad it buys in just a minute

88
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,990
%uh or you'll just reverse engineering
have to gaining information to have his

89
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,610
way

90
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,890
just for the best the debugging rated a
large

91
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,590
sister so column techniques

92
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,930
and did your friends I'm primarily

93
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,710
evidence acquisition is one that anyone
who does any phrase

94
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,830
generate milieu I more scholarly is this

95
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,050
imaging is a lot of different ways to do
this forces Edmonds use the day's

96
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,880
a DA I am a lot of friends guys that
would be in case is absurd

97
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,680
us in school provisional government
seems really has a

98
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,380
was your reaction like this we just left
on a hard drive respond and doesn't

99
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,750
match

100
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:15,050
where you on recovering deleted
information is also another column 1

101
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,130
this is what is most commonly known as

102
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,300
digital raises and was finally
understood by law enforcement

103
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,600
saw it if someone is leading corporate
baidoa's child pornography which is

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,110
like a big thing in phrase that's the
estimate

105
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,990
on some was briefly sees computer tries
to find evidence of wrongdoing

106
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,560
at people trying to cover their tracks
the first thing they do is delete

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,600
the data that they shouldn't K I'll

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,140
this is quite at all in your friends and
I thought catback much about

109
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,200
are more interested and the unauthorized
access to systems

110
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,730
5 cybercrime a

111
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,290
so fled I'm

112
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,010
with regard to that other teenage that
are frequently used to discover

113
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,800
as I strive as a

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,440
fosston princess frequently thing but
I'm lining

115
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm log analysis keyword searches

116
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,280
prisons I was once the audience response
for a company that had being

117
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,360
Rob seriously on and after finding this
guy's customer shit

118
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,920
I we found that you'd actually a
dislodge stream inundated

119
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,110
inside the richest about how much she
hated sys admins large corporations up

120
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,350
so when the region was loads everything
she gets really really distinct races

121
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,430
is not meanie many times that you would
see the phrase admins can suck my deck

122
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,730
a yeah I am hearing only

123
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,760
up side yet I am

124
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,950
sensitive detection on

125
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,560
this is a reasonably well in areas are
looking to go very fast but

126
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,170
I over but quickly I'm

127
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,400
IDS is initially created an event live

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,540
an off-duty cop that was appalling shift

129
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,920
I at a shopping mall I they can actually
do anything

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,110
the notice an intrusion lot like bubble
tea what does it say

131
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,010
let sandra hodge podge do something
about it me they see a text

132
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,730
that will protect the a

133
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,460
while logs love enterprise logging tools
though

134
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,070
was just gone elsewhere you know if it's
bad is going on

135
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,670
%uh and your company these days ago
Boston GTG

136
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,149
I'll which is basically ecology where
you can patches

137
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,139
loan to value on this budget open source
database about us

138
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,279
%uh this issue really good idea but
there's a lot of suicides in the

139
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,430
security industry

140
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,779
a yeah the thing a

141
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:48,189
but whitelisting falls actually like
what a smart idea

142
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:52,720
like if you actually have miss all all
the wineries which you want to run your

143
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,850
enterprise databases and boasts of its
fusion stuff that you don't trust the

144
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,430
run

145
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,509
this is actually a really good security
it on

146
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:05,350
is commercial tools to do this if you
are a little more hot up

147
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,920
%uh DNA sorrow provides open source
database

148
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,540
up passions unfortunately it's quite
good for Windows

149
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,389
but really really bad book anything else

150
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,949
a as always nothing

151
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:24,060
a v6 of Alexis previously

152
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,540
the Shrew group used to maintain
something learn goods totaled

153
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,100
which was it was an online database all
s

154
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,129
file ashes and that's a fact but
unfortunately that's not maintain is

155
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,889

largely doll how it's worth mentioning

use riser

yes of rage him but

%uh sometimes it gets just plain
misinformation about it

186
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:22,490

doesn't

up raise formats I cripple miss on

190
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,259
however using them for long we're not
using at the moment as hosts actually

191
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,259
still reasonably painful

192
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,490
a the problem with it being thank you
most popular software

193
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,959
is that it's actually come under fairly
distribute and is even being a few

public guest list for a

195
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,319

demonstrated that you can load a

00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,550
malformed falsely

197
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,589
in case and what actually exploitable
allow arbitrary

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,459
up curry execution on the fringe
catalyst workstation

199

mom this is more of a lady friend it's
me

200
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:09,930
while this is hilarious a it's actually

201
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,740
quite what his bitch s by a guide for
everything else on your machine

maybe a little paranoid that your

I'm in other to look briefly enemy
Justin Bieber's actually

205
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,740
a made quite a splash about almost
exactly a year ago

206
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,709
I was coffee I just did this is actually
very few little

207
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,170
a coffee is an essential tool doing
forensic spotted

208
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,240
stop dress not not at school that was
released by Microsoft

209
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,160
the weather about river that's what
happened here so you like coffee was

210
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,490
developed by this form of Hong Kong
police officer

211
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,279
now let's let's hear the skater
Microsoft and

212
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,579
you can see that this device office in
discussions about so-called friends

213
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,709
and is used by over 2,000 police
officers like 15 countries

214
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,180
and it's basically just as modified
flash drive up but

215
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,769
don't click forensics investigation is
largely but not technically stop

216
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,930
I'm just don't wanna made it all is
nothing particularly groundbreaking and

217
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,629
hot coffee that does not exist elsewhere

218
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,670
a is no craziness is

219
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,220
are you read on bank or anything like
that I miss the excitement around

220
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,350
software

221
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,680
was that it was really difficult 8 I'll

222
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,720
and forensic experts the Esperance
community room for

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,559
sounds like some was delivers really
interested

224
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,790
and a and bit late and people have a
look at it

225
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,470
and these people as the month action red
none

226
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,769
she's you know not sexually crazy role
at all these are really available

227
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:47,869
system settles in Israel's case I am

228
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,389
however Microsoft was gracious enough to
provide switch operators for

229
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:54,509
say so yup a

230
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:58,089
ends predictably some guys write
something about the jet

231
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:01,540
a as provided real-time monitoring for
coffee

232
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,930
of the sea which is a news piece that's
among applications so close in coffee

233
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,220
he care would do a variety of things I
would

234
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,709
clear loves the GB USB device up

235
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,949
match ever dates for mad reasons keokuk
easels

236
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:20,649
okay this also will not defeat real
forensic analyst announces

237
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:25,819
I'll although there is really piss off
the car let's try to look a

238
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:31,749
up and it's the same shouli essentially
a media stunt to piss off by itself but

239
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,360
I'll so drugs I'm us

240
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,369
key tenets of resistance to keep in mind
is being reported

241
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:41,480
right as God detection data recovery

242
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,589
data processing and data analysts that

243
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:47,619
annals that analysis of this lot of its

244
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:51,019
on so is frequently to stop by

245
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:54,499
basically anything that you can plug
budget pictures videos

246
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,589
email it is called statically
investigation

247
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,949
the stuff that we have more interested
in balsams laws

248
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:04,350
now love walking is a really boring
topic

249
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,050
I'll generally but logs are just just
just log

250
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,170
anymore what people could be locking
these days but day

251
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,290
a.m. so unity recently

252
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,779
pre-release something called El effect
which isn't really

253
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,939
publicly available yet but it's a tool
for logging forces executioners one does

254
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:26,350
so well log every time a process called

255
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,439
the idea being that if you see a process
lawn in a production environment

256
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:33,990
that you've never seen scorn given
fireman you have a pretty good idea that

257
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,360
something is actually gone very bad bro

258
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,100
this is actually a really good idea if
you don't want to pay for it all today s

259
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,949
I you could set up something yourself
but it should be under Windows using W

260
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:45,689
my

261
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:49,509
up there is perhaps units actually
oppresses County quite a while

262
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:53,019
solder I mean if someone is actually
incorporating this type longing in the

263
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:53,679
environment

264
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,670
you actually raises the boba tea people
but significantly

265
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,929
on sorry like anything this type

266
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:05,209
logging can be avoided by it makes
things a lot more difficult

267
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:09,230
so too which promises but speaking about
avoidance which is generally what we're

268
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,490
here to discuss

269
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,220
so we'll get it on but France's stirring
up

270
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,179
was a right the Eddie Francis is it up
techniques designed to you

271
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,209
just a bit the by prostrate

272
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:25,589
friends catalyst the clearly this is
either through

273
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,069
obfuscating in the nuts ensuring
evidence never created

274
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:32,429
up the latter is obviously been at the
four but is

275
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:37,619
frequent other no but I don't eat meat
that you got in some play

276
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,240
really depends on someone else's you try
to avoid I

277
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,029
to paraphrase Bruce Schneier about voter
fate is a different city needs which was

278
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,259
thought someone getting

279
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,269
live looking at pornography were and
then there's the type antifreeze

280
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:53,779
techniques which we keep someone at a
present from the Fortune

281
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,220
and sorry we're gonna surrounds it makes

282
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,139
was used primarily entry situations I'm

283
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,240
won't yes i won is worried about

284
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,439
up there being pressured summers
performing analysis

285
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,890
on a boss at the hotel work for them
which has been confiscated problem

286
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,520
ladies with you as awful which controls
the free market

287
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,070
it up I'm and she needs to avoid
detection

288
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,180
of bosses with a remotely controlled
wild

289
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,550
been doing research I've is writing
about stuff londonderry most

290
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,130
a so the more about this deal or say
really

291
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,680
osteotomy which is the outsides writing
hidden messages in a way that

292
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,880
no one apart from listeners a PM can
actually speak this is the message

293
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,960
a similar the most obscure forms
security through obscurity very

294
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,500
interesting

295
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,180
not touch it on packing which is me that
it was during the wineries

296
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,180
run a remote system to make investing

297
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,330
difficult again I'm not really had such
as:

298
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,410
a very interesting topic about taking
the title so

299
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,530
what am I gonna talk about so

300
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,760
st. Francis I am the court in its

301
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,640
it struck here I'm inspiration were
laying it out so clearly

302
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,330
has to go to the driving alone I want
grim up by any is in this bill

303
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,280
%uh so data destruction II Jim leaving
is little evidence behind

304
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,360
as possible um wanna hide

305
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,520
do you leave behind a week actually
behind pet

306
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,510
to try to assist rooted for example I'm

307
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,600
data translation even even if we're
going to be behind

308
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,970
is good it should be really difficult to

309
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,570
analyze housebound so it should be
packing for

310
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,740
the seizure I'm obviously this is a
double-edge sword

311
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,670
anytime you get sick leave a you'll see
when she becomes more distinctive

312
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,710
I'll i've seen someone it seems to lie
and

313
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,680
up a rootkit custom after that they
themselves created

314
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,190
I love because the winery was packed in
such a bizarre way actually set off

315
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,630
thats your 674 system

316
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:08,380
so the dice la cita mmm a massive delays
in the region in a minute but

317
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,820
out by the way he actually got caught
was because the anti virus had initially

318
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,870
frustrated as customs me um having said
that it was also easy to spot with his

319
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,300
TV

320
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,120
was out today racing engine take up the
skies outside

321
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,890
on less it is various trade-offs using
this

322
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,480
I okay she is really interesting one I'm

323
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,820
against Ricky as mere so

324
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,820
this is an idea he basically a
difference analyst

325
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,040
down all spa to change or repair

326
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,920
so essentially your friends catalyst
someone who just have to do a job doing

327
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,420
today

328
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,680
which describe what's happened to the
system year

329
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,190
and present some common knowledge

330
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,790
got then he may potentially write this
off as a reply asap done my job

331
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,060
alleges bash trial of his boss top and
its

332
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,030
you know everyone's happy into the day I
am

333
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,560
F you can explain the everybody on this
in this may work

334
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,900
this is very subtle up as she only knew
u'd it seems it under

335
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,040
about six that's up with this idea is
obviously

336
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,470
don't create anything and lives in the
first place

337
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,120
a so let's examine these in a bit what
did I don't understand a destruction

338
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,840
you have to know who the hell costs were
lol a display

339
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,850
visit everyone the understanding of all
sizes were Russia

340
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,180
really but look is not so

341
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,990
basically you have I generally software
stores met you later about files

342
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,240
I am my other units superblock which
contains basic information about

343
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,260
balsam lot size: number lost them what's
the group

344
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,290
for Linux Citra I have my own store

345
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,220
while Muniz Asia on the Windows years
ago imitate

346
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,530
and this does mean is it about files it
yes more freedom in the past self

347
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,990
us with no defense & space in the in
eighty is there a cover

348
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,390
this never gets it out so as most know
when you delete files on a computer

349
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,200
they don't really get at least I'm false
to merely

350
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,520
removes pointed to the files is that
these losses 3

351
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,670
be reallocated be ready on so given the
size modern this

352
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,480
dependent on this purpose can frequently
be unlikely that the stuff the space

353
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,310
actually if he gets reelected

354
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,950
something from Baxter cover so we want
to get

355
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,190
made all bothers you all I know it's

356
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,180
33% increase better boss so did there's
right tools

357
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,480
doing this on Sri

358
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,660
out and i think is a pot according to
utilize these days

359
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,670
on bitches poppy

360
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:52,050
pgp a contains one 06 now has a secure

361
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:56,180
just up here Asia function built and

362
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,770
so the problem is

363
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,890
that

364
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,280
a lot of the school did not work like
you'd expect

365
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,200
I and there's a lot of mister en route
about securitization

366
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,820
the most common of which is the electron
microscope met a

367
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,390
side is going to execute very very smart
guy would be good in

368
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,810
I who was spotted a crashing on the
shore possibly for that happened

369
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,770
recently

370
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,010
I'll almost every time someone told us
to leave

371
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,040
fact I believe you man Sri on UNIX

372
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,240
actually mentions have see is the good
for me stipulates

373
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,830
thirty-sevens height Brenden Pappas to
wipe data

374
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,650
this is given these is a and he is the
first person say it's like he was

375
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,690
talking about this

376
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,340
in nineteen ninety we just sweat me

377
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,340
right and now he had like a two terabyte
desk

378
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,580
the chances that be theoretical

379
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,840
you electron microscope attacked where

380
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,120
is pretty much set on

381
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,290
saw her this is life be like a uniform
met

382
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,580
however it is one that really exists and
is most common joke about

383
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,230
where people discuss your relation on

384
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,540
I don't think anyone has given going to
jail because of this

385
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm but %uh problem is that

386
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,630
third the situation told really what

387
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,500
I'll do they really do what we want her
to do we

388
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,760
really knowing what we wandered well

389
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,750
yeah about that so I'm actually a lot
like these polls that again without

390
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,140
naming names

391
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,440
own we've got tools that place to be

392
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,190
chose a friends if you're a shuttle know
if you worry about keeping budget stuff

393
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,530
you live or whenever a

394
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,860
bad the school's you know window washing

395
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,350
evidence eliminated Cyrus ROV and janet
reno

396
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,500
is actually a lot of these tools out
there for that really paranoid as he's a

397
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,650
I'm a lot of these things like made they
failed to override

398
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,800
unallocated space properly %uh thanks
how's this class like space

399
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,460
the provoking slack space but later they
failed to even get all the

400
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,230
application-specific data

401
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,540
um in the case of

402
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm wanna tools which I will make sure
you can spot a

403
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,450
up for details I would save in about I
wasn't nearly all through sleep get

404
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,950
actually discovered a

405
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,260
schrade because I'm too late but also
some rights

406
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,510
actually repeatedly overwrought and in
memory copy of the program

407
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,670
run the all this copy still leading
causes in the file

408
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,100
on which is you know obviously fire iron

409
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,120
so basically your age usual ways
actually cheat yourself to make sure

410
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,560
when it comes to at least

411
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,980
look at the disco cell is public schools
do it was that of three overs of

412
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,570
you can do it with mixed up epic star
look at your desk with this company

413
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,640
uses data are you know what it looks
like

414
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,790
I'll so day is this more extreme
examples

415
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:05,160
up their jewish right I am so

416
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,150
you can't you can just hold leave a
prize everything is actually a a

417
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,620
bootable CD which is

418
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,640
live doing this I'm and of all the
frequency in office

419
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,380
the hard drive of the summer as you'd
expect you and it is pretty self it's

420
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,310
not like complete you read about this
evening if Israel at

421
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:25,330
on you didn't know that you think things
to your files and your filesystem

422
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,410
if you want i've seen this technique
postulated everyplace you do stuff like

423
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,190
this

424
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,320
so you can you could buy change that is
all

425
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,090
of Boston's like I really liked this
movie really early if someone had to

426
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,860
give a direct but as

427
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,740
I didn't speak US and was up dirt
however I ever seen someone who's

428
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,710
postulated

429
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,750
modifying the chick someone falls so
when someone actually does

430
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,080
I like fashion houses even refile the
Boston suspect

431
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,580
I love Nexus yeah urgent hiii his music
but

432
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,490
own as I mentioned before our attacking

433
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,890
taking the seven schools is another
possibility

434
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,050
I mention the in case I don't like
however on

435
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,400
a lot of reasons tools are basically
ball a POS

436
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,530
anyone who's done East what you know is
that POS is %uh

437
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,450
massively Road up being since its
attacks

438
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,750
um so

439
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,350
in case has a lot vases

440
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:32,300
as those birds gotta as does 50k on

441
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,580
however these are the tickets you
produce that still work

442
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,890
that I all day he's like so auxiliary
with us

443
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,150
so if you have a frenzy toll at what it
does is it okay

444
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,570
okay well that's where you can look at
everything right yet

445
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,420
Germany's a pause in the system let's go
to automatically exempt look inside it

446
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,290
was a file

447
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,150
if you have what it was like 22 shots at
which expands something like 415

448
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,170
you know what's what you might say
something I've likely will crash is

449
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,570
still

450
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,710
love again this that object move

451
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,390
%uh not said a great idea but still
funny

452
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:11,010
up so under Sharia is a popular one

453
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,120
on this kinda slow and surround sound on

454
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,590
is this probe in a vase making a
daughter unreadable what watching a

455
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,590
false them as well

456
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,860
I made this is always subject to the
control C

457
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,240
up okay as well I'll this is a more
extreme

458
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,710
way of dealing with a beta me a then
mike is good

459
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,790
I have a few making the shotgun I am

460
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,850
when I A was working for the government
and I was paid to secure the lead a

461
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,100
diocese was watch

462
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,490
I am many organizations have a Aflac
commercial discretion treatise

463
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,670
I had never changed for now so sure that
this

464
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,780
but it looks very difficult okay

465
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,370
I guys when I was younger that will
carry me and my friends at

466
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,600
up while I and created didn't miss much

467
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,980
as I the idea was was that I had a part
of their lives of my hard drive

468
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,690
oster magnesium indicate a lot of points
at it that

469
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,740
this mechanism would trigger 55
insurance and he starts every day

470
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,830
%uh it so therefore if I was in prison
they came to rate my had a nut and the

471
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,800
man you know I love love love the it was
a burbank

472
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,030
however up some discussion realize that
you believe in ourselves do

473
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:26,050
Waldrop a this was never actually
implemented

474
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,430
you however if you've got to prepare for
the worst

475
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,940
which is as it every every young punks

476
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,500
year that the government has nothing
better to do than helpful M&I

477
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,950
I'm and secure deletion of them I is not
an option

478
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,450
if not I'm good Bandon there's always
jurist house emissions

479
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,800
now putting the salsa measures that
implies

480
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,360
the job by the way hey not all

481
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,460
you know book by II hotties really

482
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,920
up as much as poss yeah

483
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,250
say anything in place any surgery scale
to measure

484
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,090
this this is basically saying that you
know you're going to be in serious

485
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,620
trouble at some point

486
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,310
%uh additionally this can also be
considered a booby-trapped which may be

487
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,390
of questionable legality

488
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,940
ending on where you live on

489
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,450
having said that the fact that you're
doing this probably means you don't care

490
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,640
maybe you're just an oppressive regime

491
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,810
way if someone finds a

492
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:30,190
examples on literature with serials that
are approved by the state would be 4G

493
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,450
your police and more about what people
look like this

494
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,340
a maybe just don't like being harassed
by it was security up

495
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,170
I'll certain types that US companies
only weapons in situations

496
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,870
I then probably not way full proper
friends nice

497
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,400
I'm however may help you avoid history
investigations

498
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,710
on so the law Law Offices when it comes
to improve that they had the space for

499
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,430
interesting

500
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,430
I'm in a lot of places you can be made
to give up your objection he's

501
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,590
or you can be held indefinitely I'm

502
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,800
this scenario it does actually happens
people like dragons rooms

503
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,400
yet what a customs and he told that they
will appeal it goes away

504
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,130
secret that they have set the stage 1
1/2

505
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,410
login added to all Libyans love was a

506
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,930
I'll ever is usually what happens when
you do it as your home

507
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,290
that the credits to screen out lots and
you know it but you've gotta

508
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,190
however work what would you like to
happen

509
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,720
when you log in under the second-best I
primarily

510
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,590
loves log into a clean computer
everything looks good at is not what he

511
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,330
did

512
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,540
additionally probably like yes even do
it

513
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,550
like poking around better

514
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,930
I'll a couple is perhaps the Pelican Bay
West

515
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,980
may use yours I'm a ginger is possible

516
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,600
which means that mister incidents
involved I

517
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,920
you login screensaver pseudo

518
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,660
what is up special actions will be
carried out son Andrew

519
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,860
a uses a situation you believe someone
to compel you to provide reposted

520
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,490
and you want to deny the Nexus
information on the system

521
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,360
it would appear like a little positive
to see if that gives access your system

522
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,740
and would appear that you provide the
buzz made you but in the background

523
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,840
would carry out like

524
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,670
can't forget juries action like maybe
you would

525
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,950
in the hearings on your computer
actually a browser if your browser's

526
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,010
haitian you when I was about to file
systems

527
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,320
I you felons lacks pace of systems with
it whatever it is you actually want to

528
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,000
do it

529
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,260
I'll then you could probably start
something like it's better to stumble

530
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,240
and actually make

531
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,030
the lights us you know I me

532
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,250
whenever there's your answer I'm

533
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,830
event LA so obviously this kid's got
interesting right eye is better than I

534
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,230
was wrestling going on here

535
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,090
by eyder someone who is working on a
system I would she want it slowed

536
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,890
I've completely virtualized operating
system

537
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,910
under the noses someone who is actually
seen for now so is due to

538
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,920
this is a very wealthy I wish you luck
I've known people that have to be

539
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,050
checked the file systems and a variety
of interesting ways

540
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,350
a freedom what mines a plate technique
really alias LA's

541
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,090
to shut down shop I'm this is a great
read

542
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:20,030
but he said of himself beautiful but OK

543
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,900
hood

544
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,470
so the reason why there's discussion of
solutions like this

545
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,390
is because the traditional styles like
delivery by day because I have heard %uh

546
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,930
is it that's cool anymore a have a

547
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,930
my IQ that he really was I'm

548
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,720
you guys all know what brother who is
Chris losses kid

549
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,770
people free lets anyone who is always
played it so on

550
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,250
the head drama the actual growth

551
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,510
hywell right

552
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,110
these are traditionally this was a
buffalo's his night

553
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:05,600
I'm so it usually isn't right for
extract a cryptographic secrets from a

554
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,200
person but wishin

555
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,540
a of Trustees a technical at psyche

556
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,700
just yet be with the bro I wasn't live
side us

557
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,900
years yeah on

558
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,110
slow here along the lines of juris
making isms

559
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,810
I another four experiment which people
have

560
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,700
quality legal solutions love the
circumstances and I will pressure

561
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,110
this impression that allows users to
know I did they ever improve the false

562
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,000
the world but

563
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,510
even if they did it I love the idea of
being to reduce the effectiveness of

564
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:40,960
course

565
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,000
interrogation other ocean is arms first
public implementation of this was

566
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,640
something actually called brother who is

567
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,800
ATO selects 32 girl as a side note is
actually

568
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,710
Julius ours as well as the hope is that
this a bad news

569
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,890
a furlough jails I am

570
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,010
such as basically works like this I
override

571
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,990
on the inside by spreading thought-out
every in the Datta you have multiple

572
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,720
angles and positions and they have
possibilities

573
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,290
much well the crypt his position however
you cannot tell

574
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,549
how many positions are available I'll

575
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:19,549
as so therefore there's no way the
president watch it

576
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:22,669
to prove that they've given over all the
docs a that

577
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:26,579
I'm that is available to be given and so

578
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:31,029
Kansas is there a reason love into you
stop torturing you

579
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:35,269
outdoor space you might as well not give
up any thought at all

580
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:40,549
%uh now this pretty groups are these
role pretty grim scenario

581
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:43,929
bad light as interesting as these
potential problems and possible

582
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:44,440
solutions

583
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,899
up they mean that basically this is all
reactors

584
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:53,169
I'll this is not we want to pay up

585
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:57,149
so let's talk a little bit more about up
concealment

586
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:00,460
and how people quality getting

587
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,160
situations where being compelled to do
things

588
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,950
I'm something stroll down memory lane
the first thing that

589
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,789
anyone even lead to do will learn to
spot was to look at it

590
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:15,930
process and so is the best thing people
than ever

591
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,589
machines change times that's a positive
change I'll

592
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,759
sex is not really it was I that fosters
wannabes peace

593
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:27,990
evidence that you had up likely to be
one of the most extensively examined

594
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:32,980
I am with the trust fund on the UNIX to
change through three times there's

595
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,849
I was reported by the filesystem up any
loose roads will punch a hole in the

596
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:43,309
last changed: Pawlenty a case I'm report

597
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,660
other things that people is due to high
files you know he'll

598
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,589
oval .tv title is see it

599
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:55,759
own a yes common life I'll to die
streams one knows

600
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:59,089
but you can I pay me things begin to
file it doesn't show up an exploratory

601
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,019
see

602
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:03,410
outpost messed up you could actually
others in

603
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,009
up an argument and operated it be poss
do it Manchaca Lightsey this

604
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:11,339
some reason use though

605
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,640
time see alternate data streams as
Florida yes I

606
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,349
don't know why really hasn't sure they
have reason were

607
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:22,059
basically it's as simple as or something
like that

608
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:25,839
right to hide something and not to that
extreme and being

609
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,180
you can just then that's right

610
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,230
I was shoppin Explorer on

611
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,390

640
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:18,230
eligibility and Scott increasingly more
precise

641

along the way it freezes Rep I am

643
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,279
the idea being that you know most WiFi

what forty-three beyond global out as
Disney

645
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,009
so you can just totally everything over
this I'll lows which lively

over shellfish miles only using IC baby
pretty cool

652
00:38:55,609 --> 00:39:00,029
I love this guy updated and she doesn't
852 cold on Black Star

653
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:03,869
100 I see pts so

654
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:07,999
I'll while wells Bay City need to
provide safe I love

655
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:11,609
analysis all network traffic to watch
attackers

656
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:15,099
has got a little bit more are a

657
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:18,660
%uh largely due to the fact that these
days 13

658
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,980
you could say all logic

659
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,589
are I'm not too sure about this business
costs about 300 bucks

660
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:29,079
says actually feasible that you can save
although traffic

661
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,700
all the hood and come back and look at
it I'm

662
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,839
for something that is definitely worth
keeping in mind

663
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:41,349
I'll will be have a Disney references
I'll

664
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:44,420
so the pain

665
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,519
new advances field as I mentioned before
specifically in the area isn't yet not

666
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,690
conceal it

667
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,599
thought of a station about opposition
I'm

668
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,519
no big plans to issue days is on this
flight they have sweet

669
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,630
mafia on they told created by God baby
blue

670
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,789
times of which are major changing times
excellent as I would separate which is

671
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:07,249
now based ranges that

672
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:10,819
in erie intrusion framework you don't
leave a drug test

673
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:14,869
I am and I think that your school's
letter

674
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:17,930
so it's like it was a technique

675
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,910
by which you could try to file its
expects

676
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,920
so the Windows operating system uses
exercise classes today

677
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,559
a entire cluster is yours even if I'll
dozen the data being stored doesn't but

678
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,819
so the space between enough I'll into
clusters will express

679
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:37,230
on this is obviously in a few other
places the data that we don't want

680
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,680
people to see

681
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,319
I'll unfortunately these days most and
the phrase tools

682
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,700
and something and less less space
additionally a lot of this is

683
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,779
system administrators a proactive and a

684
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,349
me a shot of your wiping sweat space
I'll

685
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,119
also when the skies Windows guys that
really had to go to have this

686
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,950
& Poor's 2k3 of racism that he 0 outs
left spaces entirety

687
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:06,369
and the Aussie in the fall in-stock Xbox
UK Trade

688
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:09,749
I was the fact that work the reason was
bitchy yes because

689
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:13,329
lies JJ's a great place a great father

690
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:17,430
relief wells likes paste the hyperlinks
I'm however

691
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,730
slate repeated me which is a bit cooler
is in bad involved in Salem

692
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,269
so this guy couldn't drive right an
amusingly

693
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:28,730
titled paper and fretful this best best

694
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,519

696
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:42,920
he had 14 a serious I misuse had died of
my story it wasn't bad loss while

699
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:54,069
very it was a on its face and while if
you strike but like

700
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:58,019
own you agility boss

701
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,329
so the people that know who lexical

702
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:04,539
ext2 ext3 filesystems almost exactly the
same

703
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:08,210
how to ext3 has the budgetary Boston
jail

704
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,549
how it but you could block a filesystem
as

705
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:15,279
ext3 filesystems ext2 without you I'm

706
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:18,849
notice billion pounds is just the
general one use

707
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:22,029
this leaves the Boston general they did
was give you about

708
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:26,710
E big space spoonfuls in that the gloves

709
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,720
on so the statements by her once was
published

710
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,779
I've changeable for anyone looking for
on

711
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:36,900
s just look at it. don't capture data
I'll

712
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,480
I the popular open source toolkit sleuth
kit

713
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,549
i has to JK Journal 5 specifically for
the season at

714
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:50,769
I'll a very simple as a teenage India vs

715
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,839
I house despite possible right it is
snow on

716
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,989
in any bnet policy repository meta data
on the inside baseball system

717

%uh as a file and out the starting
location is getting the boot setup

718
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:06,599
and every file in directory has at least
one in GM's

719
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,749
as I mentioned before this place is
never recover

720
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:14,079
I'm now lol

721
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,200
only the first porn tube lights a unity

722
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,239
injury has a specific date like this up
to that possible filehost: all

723
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,950
I'm story file attributes on average was
found at

724
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,299
is editor Moreno 600

three whites for 80 mg beverage Windows
boss

726
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:37,420
on XP as about 200,000

727
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,869
50 entries so but that's a lot of
replies

728
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:46,749
iron mostly it was found for that
there's that sixty percent of these

729
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,289
injuries were free to use

730
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:51,369
that surround the 16-acre free space I

731
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:54,710
document also limit Monroe release this

732
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,539
at life back to basics island

733
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:03,839
Haven roadkill device driver CD acha
files from freddy is

734
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,410
which is again very cool about being
good guys there's

735
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,890
wrote all the cases which is increasing
the HD so

736
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,069
using this technique you probably get
caught

737
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,819
a one day

738
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:21,220
should also seem appealing on but while
fighting

739
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,279
data and the filesystem is interesting

740
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:28,369
you might get is the fight and
executables wallace's banana peel

741
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:31,579
major issue doing so does that this is a
change all checks out

742
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:34,859
and you were medically sweats I all your
needs

743
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:38,890
so this case is funded by refile changes
frequently

744
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,390
I doubt that a bit I'll an obvious
choice for this but instead Windows

745
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,420
the registry I which is

746
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,759
a lodge winery while eyelets

747
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:53,309
changes constantly so you can encrypt
the file

748
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:58,829
and a and on split up interest by
retailers just under extreme I'll

749
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:02,009
if someone was looking for this this
would obviously be

750
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:06,200
incredibly noisy do you see this massive
Irish other reduced

751
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,720
if they want however was it probably
would occur

752
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,730
%uh so the right way which we actually
get there

753
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,950
that is generally replaced with visions
of it combined prudential yet these are

754
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,980
the two most common methods

755
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:26,539
is provided she was going to break into
computers I'm

756
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:30,849
what's people are broken and generally
yankee laws

757
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:34,230
rootkits stop even made out tramping
around

758
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,450
false them but no one of my eyes
although perhaps not

759
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,099
I'll juditha raisa commercial
exploitation brainless

760
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:45,109
due to the rise in the security industry
he was black mesh

761
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:51,380
pools 02 the complexity of the export
payload has increased considerably

762
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:56,009
I'll been I something really huge
improvements you know all these

763
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:57,299
different she makes

764
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:00,849
ahh what they all out it is never
crossing

765
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:04,109
interactive access to a host nearly
lunch programs

766
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:08,259
all without touching the ball system for
many cases without busy bees falling in

767
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:11,359
other processes over the one that was
originally slated

768
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:16,059
on as I see it debuts Friday differences
case but you know lately

769
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:19,579
I was I was at school which invokes a
server that offers

770
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:23,579
access to its own address space better
than other processes upload winery is

771
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:24,269
this

772
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:28,890
I'm at initialize the winery and then
your pasta control all the programs the

773
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,160
entry point piracy

774
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,489
executed I was the first tools to do
this was to

775
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:37,049
our exit which involves using a
combination GB

776
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:40,170
and a custom usual every written by the
truck

777
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,690
on Cisco processing is what issues but
we're

778
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:49,589
extolled as balls starting material if
she rejects the proxy for loose balls

779
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:53,739
I'm as it isn't as if you wanna play
with that one that is actually pretty

780
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:58,279
and reason well maintained as much
effort up I'll

781
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:02,239
this is actually very cool very easy to
use however as long as the CBO try to

782
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,519
teach yourself how to use this

783
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,829
under the Securities review what Ivan

784
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:10,809
however staying here is that means that
false then the house washing even as

785
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:12,039
your behavior

786
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:16,259
and is no finer is through this I'll
this isn't necessarily the most

787
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:16,999
persistent

788
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:20,239
if there exists however it does leave
the most evidence

789
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,430
up people who are trying to break
resistance then

790
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,479
rejects I

791
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:31,160
freely the comment will call I'll

792
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,729
these her gain increasingly severe the S

793
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:39,229
I'm and discover the guys is secure
talking about resurgent Wednesday

794
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:42,569
at midday all the beach out I'll

795
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:46,200
over we'll see a difference riches I got
down bilby

796
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,450
I wrote up bus driver version of the old
driver

797
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,700
services this recalls a lot of a
conscience just

798
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,890
the day %uh you rather have also
recently

799
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,259
well a couple years ago things were in
vince says true in this rigid

800
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:03,329
accompli both the claim being that
virtualization supposed to be a

801
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:04,229
teachable

802
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:07,619
and so the only way that we should be
seated is that the visualization itself

803
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,559
was detectable and this visualization

804
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:13,809
friendship I'll 8.0 s richest

805
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:16,989
one that was really cool couple years
ago was written the bejeweled

806
00:48:16,989 --> 00:48:21,950
net firmly rooted this right itself also
on the freeway and use the GPS you just

807
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,650
for seasoned it will wipe us he's

808
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,019
you completely all it's very grateful

809
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:30,940
I'll last chess a pretty interesting
idea

810
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:36,380
on its rules relating one for knows it's
a good idea to exceptional by us

811
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,249
and with very weak edging incident I
just as briefly on your computer is

812
00:48:40,249 --> 00:48:41,839
about 20 different places

813
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,299
rewrite for with on that's a lot of
places

814
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:49,589
people to YouTube to maintain
persistence have its theory oxygen just

815
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:53,569
attack not reportable it only really
practical someone's going after a really

816
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:55,239
high profile attacks like it

817
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:59,420
on at which brings me it's true

818
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,430
was attributes which guys Mirinda this
is the Stedelijk grace

819
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,519
risk guys were custom rootkit for

820
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:10,779
I suppose which so there's a lot of
speculation about who gets the ball

821
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:15,400
lot lately laws but the payoff was at
the end up tapping the phones

822
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,630
I love a really large number of
high-profile officials

823
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:23,059
it breaks up so this billowed advances
in this area

824
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:26,660
I it's not all just runaway like it to
the roof developers

825
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,259
there's been some notable bars in the
freezer side a

826
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:34,880
most risk has any references iron

827
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,430
the most common of me rephrase it

828
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,829
frameworks probably volatility a which
works

829
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:48,059
on a sea of Miri profiles so if you get
a mirror image for all the WinXP Boston

830
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:52,739
it contains profiles striped collar
structures with Alex's ok we'll

831
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,749
I it's written in fights and it's easily
extensible and modules

832
00:49:56,749 --> 00:50:00,369
out there I like now line is our fourth
which

833
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:03,869
can be used to find common techniques
that route is used to hide

834
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,910
inward a let's

835
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,460
you can use the rehab specialist done
here and be used to be able to access

836
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,430
the VM

837
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:15,470
or Windows backs especially physical
memory by operating system vendors but

838
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,140
weiss's

839
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,549
years ago decided that the really
exposing me to be was a bad

840
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,869
yet %uh saw you

841
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:26,859
re we have use external drives up a
briefly

842
00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:31,809
as as is common in the really behind a
RecA citizens must refocus

843
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:37,089
of racism %uh met you switch release the
paper on analyzing the high-profile

844
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:40,099
I'm but that draw

845
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:43,950
there's still a lot of public-private
but something every on over 60 House

846
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,749
private ones out there on 10 problems
with these tools is that there are tons

847
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:48,960
and the presses

848
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,239
so I first thought you know israel also
I'll similarly running at school

849
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,519
change the state thing we're trying to
court %uh secretly as possible as saying

850
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:58,769
that software may reside on the system

851
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:02,079
created specifically lie to you others
even richer

852
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,190
written by Russia response and gave up

853
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,739
up show it was used a statement in
relation on

854
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:12,269
to specifically would spend the night in
reviewing the pages

855
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,759
that reside in lustful um

856
00:51:15,759 --> 00:51:18,880
so the principal it was around
acquisition told that exist

857
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,479
outside the space I love that was being
dumped

858
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:26,200
I'm so this isn't a new idea

859
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,099
other league people here vs laos

860
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:33,809
oh man I'm holes %uh yeah

861
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:37,499
a spot I can teach you actually had this
idea by the open before where

862
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:40,970
he just pissed off a placing and

863
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,019
it would a right

864
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:49,160
a crash dump memories that's a although
it's a hardware guy danger grand love

865
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,309
you but if it up

866
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:53,859
back in 2003 head over the PC of God and
His

867
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:57,579
switch on the back that was turned off
but since I'm so it was

868
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:01,529
not exist why the operating system we
turned it on the PC I would call them

869
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:04,779
the trouble trout will come into the PCI
bus

870
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:08,400
in the first set annualized you make a
copy of the college's

871
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,609
every I was pretty sweet doesn't have to
win every

872
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:16,509
pretty eyes like to on cuz see this
being used for Sonos

873
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:20,119
downside this however is that you have
to install them on

874
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:23,950
Irish's of on

875
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:27,749
however up %uh physical reason for
requiring every much worse

876
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:32,059
all devices that FIYA

877
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:35,400
I was planning it back in 2006 rostov

878
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,259
by Michael envelope I we demonstrate a
taxing the rich briefly while file

879
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:44,640
I am trashing your Windows XP sp2 most
to disable screensaver

880
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,829
so if I was just but you may ask secret
actually done

881
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:51,859
we have retaken the problem is the
device especially have to follow his

882
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:52,479
face

883
00:52:52,479 --> 00:52:58,329
is to be used so heating let you into my
arms race live but I had earlier

884
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:01,460
like yeah virgin rejection is very much
that

885
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,769
on one piece of advice that I always
liked is the keep it simple one

886
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:08,789
own customer chance custom things

887
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:12,940
hardware devices you can also wanna show
with bash

888
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,779
at a random batch processes running boss
is also not that likely to get noticed

889
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:20,200
55 on it can be difficult

890
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,309
Jays experiences and really have to be a
look for it

891
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:27,039
on again the suspect was a little while
ago walk

892
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,710
by Chenault warning it will consider as

893
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,849
you get a shot using that on I say this
is judy has given effective but

894
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:39,849
I'm these days people didn't fight and
he was qualified to interpret you can

895
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:40,509
run leaving

896
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,410
you know I'll running at five sided

897
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:48,279
Minister whatever Council transits up

898
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:53,479
so basically just is that was noted by
any right in with Carfrae Sunzu but

899
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,579
which is you way she often everywhere

900
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:59,140
on but people should

901
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,859
regattas the side of his face at all I
think about the in game

902
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:06,720
a people think that they're not going to
be undone but in my experience it

903
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,869
happens a lot more often than they think

904
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:13,390
a if we're having a plan what to do and
what your tech I might do in the ones

905
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,460
we've gotten that one sees their

906
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,519
is a very good idea I'm so

907
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:22,359
you get to see the resource the residual
if this paper

908
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:27,769
a spoke and doesn't even many Christians

909
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:32,749
anything at all yes him

910
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:35,979
coolest newest thing i've seen

911
00:54:35,979 --> 00:54:39,160
alone equalizer

912
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,609
okay the hiding own

913
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:47,210
other people don't use like a lot as a
file system of the station chase these

914
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,049
days like

915
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:55,049
I say I just love she makes involve a.m.

916
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:58,469
people realistically people freeze la

917
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:02,089
on in that in that day

918
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:05,609
but the reasons I'm the recent refresh
knowledge right

919
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:09,969
now is operating system portable however
what they did little to do this was they

920
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:13,950
brought a Java runtime within was it
used explained download it

921
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:18,299
they would download the Java Runtime
from the internet from Sun

922
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:22,769
and then run this message of up I which
I love the times you don't see he really

923
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:24,229
8368

924
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:27,999
I am however I mean there's been some
wholesome

925
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:32,390
proof positive polymorphic stop on like
rust off da TSI

926
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:35,650
was it absolutely also be smaller

927
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:41,210
%uh by its it's a bit too complicated to
go and see exactly why now that had

928
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,710
a variety commands you now says mean
it's built into it

929
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:48,559
i jus this malware was postulated a
couple years before it was that letters

930
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,619
in the wild for

931
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:52,940
if %uh and that sexy body wanted a nice
piece is a custom

932
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,200
obfuscation reverse engineering

933
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,109
obfuscation I am I it had a lot of
things going on

934
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:04,299
observer is masha right up so that if
you actually want to see

935
00:56:04,299 --> 00:56:08,920
a PC software that was designed to obey
detection and be incredibly difficult to

936
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,839
analyze once

937
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,519
was detected I remember him from that

938
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,749
in us who

939
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,400
a.m. show them all

940
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,140
wall his life day

941
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,049
I'll so

942
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:34,390
most the time acid so i jus

943
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,549
who I'll is it all

944
00:56:37,549 --> 00:56:41,269
called the race for Windows values for
years I'm busy is truly

945
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:44,969
which i think is providing lessons and
also when I was pretty good

946
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:50,309
Sri only the usual thing as up to go be
known by Weezy in a real-life years ago

947
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:55,799
it was but respectful shortcomings the
enable one on always it's actually works

948
00:56:55,799 --> 00:57:00,359
boxes of I'll for the free tools

949
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:04,090
yes

950
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,070
