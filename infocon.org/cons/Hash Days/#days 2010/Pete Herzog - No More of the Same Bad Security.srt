they also cannot make dot visions of

94
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,660
and your officials on this because
they're so dedicated

95
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,860

I and that's where we are today

100
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,930
that is stay our for

101

that's the beginning so

102
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,740
what do we have to show this security is
a process

103
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,479
people it hackers funny kid feel really
good

104
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,090

nothing we can do to stop them

105
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,190
obviously somebody said bill his

106
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,210

we can't feel sorry for those people or

168
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,430
we get them to agree with for maybe some
are

169
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,270
but in the end it's getting a little
late to the party

170
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,399
eventually people are going to realize
the 21

171
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,070
at leaves

172
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,810
there

173
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,440
so wear stockings

174
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,040
of he goes around comes around and

175
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,019
people working security assuming both

176
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,980
you solely developers people actually
wears

177
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,690
yuri they spend most of their time
coming up fun they show everything

178
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,329
you're supposed to do they have

179
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,589
desertification suppose to all plays

180
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:41,620
with us their ability they do they had

181
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,050
and a heads up his era day

182
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,350

star you know and

187
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,670
problem is is that days Mon no security
that has existed

188
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,630
in ninety solo that

189
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,240
is right here

190
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,480
me hoping to show people the better

191
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,519

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,339
did you have already what's your email

196
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,709
okay Johann other people suspected
something that they're going to security

197
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:45,269
right now

198
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,160
leading all like of yeah

199
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,410
not a humorous his

200
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,459
around I so

201
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:02,490
see that is the people leave another
that sucks you

202
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,940
are that okay

203
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,959
so the first thing we didn't design ya

204
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,839
I closely follow best practices because
that's all I need is you

205
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,010
that's right for I

206
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,540
everybody else did not like the best
practices I said there's gotta be a fine

207
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,269
way to show how secured as is

208
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:29,010
I know the story I justices police
security faster

209
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,459
other cars day and I had to reply

210
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,040
shoulders and people out there now

211
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,819
I know basically so far arms other
companies

212
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,500
always does are I didn't know that yeah

213
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,269
for and the stories that they were

214
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:51,569
just because they have higher but I
believe that

215
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:55,360
and I started collecting and I certainly
together and

216
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,319
does version the office and then

217
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:02,790
got I said okay this is good but I fell

218
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,490
a better than others speaking of to
except had a problem the best practices

219
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,920
did if not no I had diploma

220
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,060
%uh with with their really better like
the Big Lots says

221
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,439
yeah Google+ basis for the other was
just for

222
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:26,069
a hacker should be groupings now I'm
actually followed

223
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:30,089
real quality him essay

224
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,670
okay how is it his hands issue just that

225
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,750
%uh something's wrong rigors of an
illegal gun

226
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:45,709
2.1 favorite and that's where you live

227
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,069
something is fundamentally wrong because
are

228
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:54,860
risk assessment done thank you were
still

229
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,019
all so much the time because the pot and
I suspect that this get

230
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,000
how can be supplied we were classified

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,300
you play everything fast you measure
right

232
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,730
I measure how the disabled list you fast

233
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,829
little you compare it against up

234
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,290
you prepared yes I'll something zook

235
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,899
I guess you tested

236
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,970
measure we're testing networks

237
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,899
your if he can measure that comes up the
small

238

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:45,589
he has 50 wheeler a infrared laser

242
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,000
his between complex anyone see if this

see what a treasure you gonna every time
yeah

244
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,970
you get a different number you think
your mom

245
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,990
butler's where your method up

246

you tell you when you thank you know
something's wrong

249
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,480
in this very worthwhile

250
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,779
superstar hack you addressed philosophy
with security plus

251
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,740
started with what the hell is secular I

252
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,809
every single one review indiscriminate
flows

253
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:31,029
here you also

254
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,420
CS bigger but

255
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,449
policy hard you will have no idea here
yet

256
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,699
noah K I'm not saying let's it is i'm
talking about.

257
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:47,110
operation ownership or something is
secure

258
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:54,110
so tell you that behavior

259
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,800
loss here what here does

260
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,040
your yeah eating you have to attack
something first

261
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,559
for security princess so there's a lot

262
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,050
%uh he started thinking sure I love you

263
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,449
same discussion stay overseas %uh

264
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,880
love came out is Chris writer secured

265
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,459
risk is a funny thing is prescribed for
any

266
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:24,770
David I I

267
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,970
once before there's a lot industries use
fresh

268
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,429
and I'm sure industry like cleanup

269
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:36,020
views expressed you can tell you
fundamental problem with their

270
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,070
insurance companies use fresh

271
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,130
is a how much people okay

272
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,290
comment others what's the problem

273
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,300
so sure

274
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,240
sup overhaul which game

275
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,570
some people whatever compensation knife

276
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,919
CS is fresh okay

277
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,169
think you have to game the system so
that the house always with little bit

278
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:04,550
more

279
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,610
okay loses there

280
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,649
you know here

281
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:18,669
like a

282
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,580
further

283
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,970
%uh you probably too if you think you

284
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,840
any industry uses rest the day

285
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,980
you're going to find is a you cannot

286
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,070
sprint

287
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,450
insecure whenever a stress

288
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,230
you're listening to some people for

289
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,409
all you know you say well I use this
product

290
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:49,460
and is going to protect most up right

291
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,769
with me I fall hearsay I one supplied
the security

292
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,610
like trying to users under the bus for a
minute

293
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,500
and and you activity this

294
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:08,500
progress %uh the Chris risk this rest in
the problem is that

295
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,899
you talk about security like I'll there

296
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,070
and probably think that this is of
course

297
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,169
government here is it busy with homework

298
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,950
statistics I weeks which is OK

299
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,120
for the majority his release toxins you

300
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,789
3 love free because they don't fall

301
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:32,429
just we're building an organization

302
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,389
can you believe security organization
you already this I T

303
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,440
well or you gotta work to build

304
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,159
their security if you're already
throwing 70 up

305
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,159
you have to realize is

306
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,919
for the other right

307
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,360
you you know everything is OK

308
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,460
comply with its okay the first

309
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,769
right as the close froze them less and
this other stuff

310
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,279
for us there are here I S

311

00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:16,039
our jobs protect every not most people

313
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:21,230
after investors are and if it's just a
network to the company's

314
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,409

okay the interesting thing is that we
all have you believe

435
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:07,779
and this was something else he comes up

436
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:11,759
triple is because if you can focus on
his brother

437
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,919
traffic most people accept that you
feeling left out

438
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,169
very they would not because they were
discussing

439
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,549
got and people take advantage

440
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:30,070
politicians think measure F are you
don't live

441
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,490
you think people use

442
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,990
people because they trains and I should

443
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,869
it is it is it doesn't get done only
sector what match for a number of

444
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:43,789
reasons trust any

445
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,789
without overlap okay

446
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:51,679
possible official controlled if you want
to protect stuff forget

447
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,389
everything out within the same

448
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:59,100
say up this

449
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,480
wire was the National over

450
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,050
operation controls possibly have check
something

451
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,360
in others

452
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,330
process but %uh

453
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,559
overlapping said

454
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,529
no believe me with his work

455
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:25,669
we discover that was such a nice round
number

456
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:30,729
newspaper said because we do know is
that

457
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:35,109
because it just sounds good sure factory

458
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:40,049
first day we give up to 30 okay

459
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,289
then the love that was it suffers all

460
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,389
left troll K his

461
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:52,459
trace configuration okay

462
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,650
a his actions

463
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,640
setting up

464
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,060
working 3 review

465
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,540
and a much lower he's there the
rationale first polls

466
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,740
iraqi are up another

467
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,210
troll his authentication is made up a
few

468
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,020
not bridge will identification offers

469
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,030
so anything that whether

470
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,160
fired packets a a

471
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,720
loving passwords users

472
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,110
a a lot the he

473
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,820
a any I he buyers

474
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,970
his signature file

475
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:47,100
everything yeah here

476
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,530
flawless just like that by for he's

477
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:56,680
the you think a vacation great get them
the others authorization the 10

478
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,680
person is all to have an authentication

479
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,850
and fish the problem is that I just
additional authorization

480
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,200
not operational be %uh his

481
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,880
for you cannot hear something different

482
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,360
up you ask are K

483
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,540
and a government review and credentials
but something always recommend there's

484
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,130
you cannot

485
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,880
the others authorization you cannot
Fisher

486
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,230
if I story an idea you is already in
this from

487
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,450
okay and you come in here and we live
here

488
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,010
the past summit here you hold the door
open for this guy

489
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:47,050
in New plus it here during the past %uh
authorization because the Maltese

490
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,340
his drop he still has

491
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,720
hurt to you never gave only of safe

492
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,830
guilty yes so these are two things that
bring the transfer

493
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,870

directionless you have your world okay

502
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,350
you seamless information is out

503
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:42,660
provided in the environment yeah

504
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,280
looking higher target yes

505
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,470
things out love to you something

506
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,040
runs incidents resources switch those
resources

507
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:59,750
yeah unit are normal

508
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,310
security testing dollar-million St UK

509
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:09,170
fun well that was fun rash in class
start

510
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,660
attendees information there's never any

511
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,020
you gather or verified definitions

512
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,700
are so there's action all

513
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,990
internet if you're a contraction sup

514
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,080
affect was one other thing use the
awesome

515
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,850
first a because there are some places

516
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,010
interaction actually yeah Jim

517
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,220
I track which meant

518
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,330
fine a site

519
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,590
yes a

520
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,450
security for

521
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,700
draft we define security by saying

522
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,920
it separates yeah so if you're looking
for security

523
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,470
you suffer that was it

524
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,980
the bare minimum operations security

525
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:13,980
we brought down deposition the
definition but do you have any fashion

526
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,220
you have secured

527
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,340
is something I it was does it

528
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:25,960
the problem is is that something

529
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,500
that sometimes things

530
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,409
here

531
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,750
well your servers with the world

532
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,139
you see you citing yeah

533
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,520
so that be I know

534
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,050
see see Western tracks

535
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,139
which lasted I all going

536
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,960
all of and go to the next level

537
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,970
knowing that there was no for

538
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,619
was great because that

539
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:03,720
the new how to life

540
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,720
track up

541
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,780
we fell a fraction purpose so many
interesting things we found was that

542
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,430
a look it is a help he said

543
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,609
okay 18 human body

544
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:28,210
we do you figure out Star Trek

545
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,590
here

546
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,990
look at least so everybody and you know

547
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,090
let us 18 track

548
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:43,830
the horse another here

549
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,160
you look at every track

550
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,160
yes and what it does out and we can do
that

551
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,490
the purposes of be categorized

552
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,609
it's a I'm cellular and what they did

553
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:02,780
it was do that

554
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,270
we have

555
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,140
we could do this user information any
interesting

556
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,200
yes let's look at it this way legend I
take it for

557
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,230
and I felt all the stuff they can use
that information for sale

558
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,970
you will be off the hook all you
wouldn't be able to

559
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,020
of that not

560
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,260
like not those additionally which you

561
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,760
as you look at that you can count the
number of fat cells

562
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,030
apparently other cells maybe you can see
more of an even higher

563
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,290
first with the okay

564
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:45,360
okay you know that we're fat cells
meaning

565
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,590
leather can be worse warmer

566
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,200
last itself these you can do this more

567
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,850
for us left no runs %uh you look at

568
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,020
the operation the cardiac cells

569
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,440
go to the heart which is actually
something they're doing yeah

570
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,480
fine are especially County

571
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,080

Sony these are things that are not a

573
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,940
it down this is what we did replies

574
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,930
insecure they're just County you're
looking at

575
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,280

604
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,109
scales relying on

605

here human beings they're

620
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:21,270
taxer if something was going to happen
here

621
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:28,190
closer factor rifles if you're going to
affect them

622
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,450
a done it

623
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,480
yesterday chasing people

624
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,559
with the works for Mary okay

625
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:43,680
what is the risk of injury layup

626
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,380
okay was your treasure absolutely the
same

627
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,650
it doesn't change day

628
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,650
as you know something else without
taxers

629
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,859
doesn't change the count all the stuff

630
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:03,510
on your taxes at the table we

631
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,950
had something steady cars happy change

632
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,390
which was interesting because lets you
view the entire

633
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,029
any measure fire you will be able to do
this

634
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:17,380
you things about you can even

635
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,529
figure out pressure this prevent

636
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:24,830
on water

637
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,460
this

638
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,490
just

639
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,090
okay there's only three times the rash

640
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,650
are visibility access trust

641
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:39,430
I felt like you a small something axes

642
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,190
trust but 3.fast

643
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:49,420
a one visibility there's actually
explore

644
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,070
this only happened one

645
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,210
using a

646
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,290
is also an operational control sprawl

647
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,790
dress you live he's played yeah %uh

648
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,280
called are over after

649
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,500
up which allows that

650
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,710
a to be uncover anything else under

651
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,980
network most people recognize this %uh

652
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,200
say industry Dr day

653
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,190
your firewall yes you

654
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,950
are using a shit yes you're 13 you

655
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,110
law and unifier ok send

656
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,840
controls a lot of only his

657
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,040
most you agree this is preacher thank
