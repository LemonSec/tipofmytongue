1
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,510
like to welcome you to my little talk
a.m.

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,000
about and Tennessee hiking well as you
can see I'm

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
you want no presentation for different
parts

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,730
well at least 3 a.m. the basic technique
party's divided into two parts

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,449
this fall like to present you how to and
she's rooting engines working how are

6
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:25,830
you

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,510
were able to develop your own scripts of
the world's

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,830
I'm going to discuss how are you use

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,960
and meta-analyses group's our company to
do

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,969
large-scale security assessments and
intrusion

11
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,989
mmm not a friend of mine

12
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:45,079
rich is attending today in this room

13
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,219
told me to you days ago that he thinks
and their

14
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,500
it's also very pretty boring eso

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,260
welcome to my twin top

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,530
not let my and my name is Michael I am
older

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,989
firms his company aged in Zurich

18
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,369
your specialized the Nike security and
I'm there

19
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,530
doing security assessments and
penetration tests

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,619
I'm eating private website for more
minutes 30 years

21
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,560
which provides German documents and or

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,819
for discussions and I wrote some songs

23
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,740
about p.m.

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,040
well presentation goals or unlike

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,110
represents data & maps drinking and Jim

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,340
I'm like to show you how the block and
screws very basically

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,930
and I like to show how it is possible to
procedure to process

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,090
the data that has been collected Yemen's

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,910
what I'm wondering is to

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,280
a its on present you an introduction

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,670
to Amber so I expect you know software
know how it works basically

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,360
and I'm not discussing how much you
program

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,390
order up you are desist programming
language

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,330
useful streets we will not not stick to
keep a lookout program leverages

35
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,790
for welder

36
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,070
the problems we have is them if you have
to do a vulnerability assessment

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,960
does deserve only a limited amount of
resources in time

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,770
so into awesome expects that you are
able to do your stance

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,030
very very false and results must be very
actions

40
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,700
the especially you have to do

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,190
I'll large-scale scandal very large
networks

42
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,550
you have to collect many many dates are
which is

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,280
usually not look very important for food
exploitation

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,600
but it's the basic information you need
to do targets

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,530
target oriented exploitation and this is
why we use an issue

46
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,330
our company do you want to make things
us as far as possible

47
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,010
as he stands for Emma

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,780
scripting engine which is a very very
muscular system

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,360
everything ever that lets you run your
own

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,090
streets and those are based in well
which is a very simple programming

51
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,770
language

52
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,260
if you're familiar with PHP your roof C
programming

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,690
I think you change for one or two hours
to get into the program

54
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,880
that those groups those to see scripts

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,470
are located

56
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,130
at the specific folder on your a.m. on
your most which

57
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,190
your running mm its doesn't really
matter if your onions on

58
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,330
on units Linux or Windows its

59
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,130
just the scripts folder in every street
and everyone around you

60
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,190
sunscreens im

61
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,670
that the what what does an a/c and its

62
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,060
and C streets are executed condition you
can buy

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,240
between or based scripts and host-based
streets

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,490
this means a host-based scripts is wrong
but never

65
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,010
a specific condition persists in the
hostess meant for example you can say

66
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,060
if the target host is running Windows

67
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,420
as operating system because of you West
fingerprints

68
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,140
you can run Allscripts that depends on
this information

69
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,460
or on their art bases screeds

70
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,150
a.m. you can say for example if the
target poor

71
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,859
is providing observer I'd like to run
all my grip

72
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:26,400
testings and his group were able to
access all the time that is collected

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,110
and provided by edlib

74
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,000
this is very a nice feature and is two
conditions

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,610
conditional execution in texas is the
basic data

76
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,150
makes it possible that you are trading
or

77
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,479
juju 21 he bowled and Mac

78
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,830
into a little scanner or even exploring

79
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,849
p.m. then

80
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:53,440
shall a typical an issue 1 box lunch

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,669
first hold the f2 generation arguments

82
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,460
minus small s capital C this

83
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,490
enables the spirits damn is means

84
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,300
wall street's are located in the scripts
folder of you and your

85
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,820
territory are run within this and for

86
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,060
tender

87
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,940
the the poor results upgraded to same
but they are enhanced

88
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,990
in this case on board eighty there is
the nation to be some detectives

89
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,450
and screwed the name HTML rushed right

90
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,710
please run you can see here the script
name

91
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,930
he chose discrete s sounds some
something and the

92
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,169
it would like to report first there's a
script for a

93
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,760
and of the bus is the result of this
group in this case

94
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,960
the a shemale time screens in

95
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,599
informs you about the Titan HTML title
of the site

96
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:52,630
this has been collected on the vector if
you're familiar with the guilt is

97
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,289
getting

98
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,940
did look testy for

99
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,400
you can see of are because it is outputs
does

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,760
the targets web server a.m. perhaps
doesn't really provide

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,070
a shemale by with a real-time perhaps

102
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,250
directory listing use Naples and because
of the structure of the Asian time

103
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,490
you might expect suspect that decent
achievement

104
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:24,490
thanks so good as it speeds up in June
and I liked you

105
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,960
to show you a very simple script I
khalid reports girls group

106
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,190
because he told japan's on love seeing
very simple port scan we'd like to use

107
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,800
the result

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,610
for spam and process just HR to generate

109
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,700
all more details reports more details
result

110
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,169
as you can see this looks like this

111
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,650
im in this case

112
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,700
use minus minus scripts the scripts to
define 1 singles group we would like to

113
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,169
run

114
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,250
in this case each HTTP detection and we
are

115
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,550
targeting the host or its top speed ch

116
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,880
and all the ports 1881 in

117
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,729
year ago his resolve the scripts is once
again but I'd love to skip the name of

118
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:14,200
the scheme

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,229
and outputs as you can see we

120
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,450
to inform the user standups can a d

121
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,250
there is a web server running on port 80

122
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,909
how the district work its using a
courtroom to define

123
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:32,289
hey you have to run every time if were
eighty

124
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:36,469
is identified as paid identified as open

125
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,870
you preserve information and generates

126
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,060
the outdoors it is a very very simple
script

127
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,219
I think the most simple scripture able
to write first

128
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,710
all you have to define the courtroom
which sales

129
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,419
plan district past to be excused in this
case

130
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:59,190
it has to be executed if or AG is open

131
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,140
if HTTP is detect the service and if
it's running on TCP

132
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,270
it is poor Julie Chu if this dysfunction

133
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,990
returns the value true then actually
function is executed

134
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,070
and in this case you turn a simple
stream

135
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,930
which I'm das includes two what number
which

136
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,270
are return so what what's the benefit
for scripts

137
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,440
there's no real benefits because it
doesn't provide you more information

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,500
basic and the ground before advance it

139
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,539
displace you that its very easy to
access the data that has been collected

140
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,360
by M

141
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,820
elect to to show you more sophisticated
scripts

142
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,980
im it it uses no shipping & Trading

143
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,260
version opinions down used Ducati stage
and tries to provide information

144
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,529
life we know it from the religious game

145
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,870
this is a very very simple simplistic
version of a wall sconce creampie

146
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,380
postponed i'ma democracy mailing list

147
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,700
and it's it's very simplistic but the
just basically the same

148
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,750
this is the result

149
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,960
once again use the the streets arguments
to

150
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,210
run our scripts but we name diversity
texan

151
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,810
with the common argument

152
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,620
and as an additional results and much is
in this case

153
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,120
able to tell me if the the second motion

154
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,450
it was able to fingerprint is the most
actual version or not

155
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,410
so this is basic idea 10 minutes came

156
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,720
him we have to finance dept every SMTP

157
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,720
orange not is there and that said Bell

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,520
mister the the predefined application

159
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,600
that this on Pinterest be analyze which
russian

160
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,660
sent I was running and you say okay it's
not worship a reason you

161
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,269
she here is the strip

162
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,910
prison but once again but the boardrooms
a bit more complex

163
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,040
him in this case we expect SMTP

164
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,370
and we say okay the court worst product
must be sent

165
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,540
of boats be using regular expressions

166
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,959
to identifying the version number of
that male

167
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,170
and if its aids folks 14 then

168
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,910
it's an actual machine and is not its
election much

169
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,209
so the result is you're able to you to
if you win the men's

170
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,589
manuscripts and a small database and
you're able to

171
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,649
run a real will build is going to be
displays

172
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,079
information that's been collected by him

173
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,480
from a.m.

174
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,200
this is results for ya hoops its
description reach the bank posted on the

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,210
end up mailing list

176
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,580
I'm using the homes responsibility
database data

177
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,760
ends do basically the same so

178
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,920
in in the index on before I was using
our

179
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,440
don't think percent male aids whatever
but in this case

180
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm using the although daschle the homes
responsibility

181
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,530
database and in the 60 you can see am

182
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,940
here this is

183
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,530
always BDB I'm and the name of the woman
ability

184
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,540
that the suspects on to specific books
so

185
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,460
it's a very simple script that is able
to do basic into skin

186
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,680
and lost root like to show you

187
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,810
is next one script its tries to exploit

188
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,250
is the simple Realty it looks like this

189
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,040
as busy on board eighty there's not much
so the Halton

190
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,040
and it was possible to download the past
for him

191
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,430
I he's basically saying you'll be fine
for use a Nokia phone address web

192
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,220
service

193
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,220
then of the woods you able to trent you
own requests in this case you using the

194
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,690
HTTP library

195
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,160
to generate to get repressed through the
web server

196
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,420
a on and we're trying to exploit the
vulnerability

197
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,770
and we get the response and look tried
to identify if it was possible to

198
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,940
exploit vulnerabilities

199
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,540
script looks like this im

200
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,760
there's not a complex for

201
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,910
room used for 80 or 443

202
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,310
the service might be a shitty pure HTTPS

203
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,370
and it's running on TCP hear me

204
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,300
sends the HTTP GET request it's a very
simple

205
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,420
request because we're using the

206
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,340
in library of Tennessee then

207
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,610
reuse regular expressions or that match
in this case to verify if the response

208
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,780
let's indicated exploiting this possible

209
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,530
and creature the result I'm

210
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,530
in this case we were using the library
for a GDP there are many different

211
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,600
libraries available

212
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,330
for application protocols but you're
also able to generate your own packets

213
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,880
so it's is really possible to to enhance
the whole and that

214
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,880
to do but you but you really expect okay

215
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,370
this was a basic introduction to NC and
how to see scripts

216
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,780
work not I would like to discuss

217
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,000
or or to show you how we are using this
kind

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,380
NC developments to do professional
testing

219
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,520
and professional testing false usually

220
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,080
is the prime we need results its can

221
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,820
the given to the customer so we needs to
run

222
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,470
prepare data for processing like the us
today

223
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,610
something like to give handouts
spreadsheets or we

224
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,750
use we like to use the data in a
database

225
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,730
so weak you can do all the data it is
very important for us

226
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,810
to get access to dedicated feeds

227
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,300
so I don't like you various a.m.
different dates are

228
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,590
I'm some rice in other in a

229
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,760
in one field and we want to have last
matchday

230
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,830
baseball's him we

231
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:24,130
a stage this year's to use Download AP
I'm their income taxes

232
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,340
every information that's and matt has
collected bricks

233
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,040
example the operating system the IP
address or hostname

234
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,720
talking Tom's we were able to collect
the port number

235
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,750
protocol service the version

236
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,150
or statement stages of the

237
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,150
report and we have traded

238
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,070
an additional step up referee Collins
which is collecting

239
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,070
additional details about our our streets

240
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,080
which trying to collect as many days as
possible been

241
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,720
and a.m. for example we there

242
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,210
yes versioning system if our streets and
so we like

243
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,990
to bizarre version of the script because
it's very important for us for the

244
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,670
barking

245
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,780
of the words because in Minnesota
question you can say okay we deduce

246
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,750
im stripped version whatever it is

247
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,470
be different than before and weekend
give

248
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:25,230
very solid statements yes the rapper is

249
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,290
through and drinking General Convention
pritzker

250
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,590
up would like to see that every street

251
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,730
provides this today to the same
structure

252
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:40,350
because you'd like to are sending to our
database so we need to use specialized

253
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:40,840
coats

254
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,130
as the shim betweens me includes out
with reference every scripts

255
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,810
so we can achieve our goals ants

256
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,590
resolvable anything exiles for result
fine

257
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,650
which includes all games are we have
played giving

258
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,200
is this the same my implementation very
very sad

259
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,750
by Russian as you can see YES on

260
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,820
global Constance we are using

261
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,480
to he finds the accuracy of findings I
will

262
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,300
you some Europe's of the woods him

263
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,830
and there is the basic function which

264
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,280
expect some arguments and the sands

265
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,280
the results back dinner grown fine
structure

266
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,050
the implementation of this out read the
script is very simple

267
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,260
we major includes you FB as the script

268
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,230
it's the skin reporting filed your
including

269
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,770
this is that the same streets

270
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,800
the second script I've shown you with
the set male

271
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,360
and bot he said of righty job puts
directly to the console

272
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,510
your writing output into a local
variable

273
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,520
and push the states are

274
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,850
to are function as you can see for
example

275
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,589
we have engine used here the Russian

276
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,510
variable so we know every time in every
result which version

277
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,870
all the scripts ass for Peter results

278
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,560
and your in this case or her in every
case

279
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,640
submitting the current time time with
this group executions because I expect

280
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,160
you

281
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,000
okay district has generated this result
at a specific time

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,760
which is very interesting large-scale
scans you can

283
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,020
you very interesting statistical
analysis

284
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,720
what kind of woman abilities you have
found in which

285
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,250
which time then if

286
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,650
amor generates TX another report we like
to parse this

287
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,920
XML file into our database its

288
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,030
for us it's not just the databases an
expert system

289
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm me push all the dates are

290
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,250
in there and of the woods different
people are able to maintain

291
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,150
and knowledge or the results this makes
it possible that you have

292
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,620
people collecting data Dallas chemists

293
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,940
at a customer site come back
participating to the database

294
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,730
and different analysts are eaten to 208

295
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,650
comment and expert system guess you
could say

296
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,070
suggestions for example this might be a
false positive

297
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,830
or you might have to very fine teas be
some additional tests for

298
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,500
then I have to say the least but I'll
ever is very very solid

299
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,830
a it's usually valid and flawless I

300
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,510
online the policy nixon up you know made
for customer

301
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,870
I'm them ninety-nine percent

302
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,920
all data is available in this up

303
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,600
and I suggest that you always use the
device

304
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,020
arguments because your tax money to do
that to Yahoo's

305
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,770
and it its preserve dedicated
accessibility

306
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,230
to the different informations silver
within the parsing you're still able to

307
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,010
access the different things

308
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,030
the only Palmer the only problem is

309
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,400
words can produce broken XML and our

310
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,140
they are not possible so easy you have
to fix that meant

311
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,840
make them working again his especially a
problem if you have very law stands

312
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,860
very launch you be scams which takes

313
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,560
several hours and you have two important
draws

314
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,160
you running out of time because there is
a problem Danya

315
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,300
programming from bassam your own should

316
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,139
his

317
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,160
is just a simple exotic some

318
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,780
isoforms play threats

319
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,830
there the basic danger of the scan using
Linda

320
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,030
into external file you see needs a.m.

321
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,630
when was that this game started what
words the arguments of DMS

322
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,190
and script then you have basic ohs
information

323
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,560
what was the target host name was talk
IP address

324
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,230
stuff like that and then you have jobs
of the was going to sell

325
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,410
and of the streetscape and this is what
you really

326
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,420
intrinsic interest in because makes

327
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:31,420
no health

328
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,790
a.m. we are able to you Texas

329
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,140
the different XML tags and attributes:

330
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,710
up to 60 up fire the left side you can
see

331
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,010
a boards you know the protocol older

332
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,160
number for their basic information

333
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,010
on the right side Thursday are of this
group they are

334
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,640
June attributes of this external tech
the ID

335
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,510
guy he is they of to an assistant
produced yup

336
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,650
in this case HD texan and

337
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,429
the outputs attributes contains only
output

338
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,860
occurances crew because you're using

339
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,440
describes repor we r able we were able
to chew

340
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,400
includes orgy encapsulated additional
data in the same field

341
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,000
has been seen yet additional information
about secrecy

342
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,299
of their results each idea first bus
trip was wrong

343
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,640
a.m. what the test I what's in this case

344
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,090
was a motion detection resources and
their we owe it to

345
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,429
feet difference different tunes which
were sinners

346
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,220
is used ants the basic output of the
script itself

347
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,510
and Wes times them so you can say so

348
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,490
has been generated them

349
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,710
wanna feeds excellent output in our
database im

350
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,200
we take this example outputs and put it

351
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,870
in a table which people findings which

352
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,190
is collected to many many tables for

353
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,919
those free or the main tables on the
left side

354
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,950
it's the host baby be feeding their that
the basic information about the host

355
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,429
and we link the time to thank you issues

356
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,179
a safety issue for us its it comes

357
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,820
contains the to date information about
the vulnerability that has been found it

358
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,910
and see scripts

359
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:31,360
so we are not including a description
offer will not be achieved and this is

360
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,740
true

361
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,000
you linking its with the database so

362
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,020
because it's it's much easier to
maintain descriptions in the database

363
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,440
then

364
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,840
different and some stripping is a simple

365
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,280
porno you of GDL safety issues

366
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,380
a.m. be includes as many

367
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,040
information as possible there's a
description their severity varies

368
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,240
step 2 step guides on how to exploits

369
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,330
durability don't have to measure reads

370
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,220
we have attached think issues different
families

371
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,059
even better permission for example

372
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,400
if you block a 3.5mm ability we can say

373
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,490
and this little bitty can only exist

374
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,710
if another will beauty older on denying

375
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,929
nobility earn existed before

376
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,720
this is interesting because as a result
unites generates

377
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,070
tree we chose you okay this liability as
many

378
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,160
and cease and another one is more record
holder you

379
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,860
and there are additional information on

380
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,100
like Senor suitability database

381
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,190
I'm them

382
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,240
important host this is that before im
there is

383
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,580
the information we have collected and
left you

384
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,080
IP address those them but never yes
information like

385
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,780
the older with the purpose of the host
which is

386
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,780
very interesting if you have large-scale
scan

387
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,830
most customers don't really know want
their systems are doing

388
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,840
and if you document this kind of
information

389
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,140
many customers are very at their table

390
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,300
is across table important findings

391
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,950
which came out there this is Prince
those includes

392
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,110
once again which ports sovereignty the
name

393
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:30,470
strip versions skip you free

394
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,540
is into databases looks like nation

395
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,020
database we can make some lookouts %um
and is this

396
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,140
of course grades because you have all
the data collected in a database

397
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,500
and as I said before we are supporting
different products for example

398
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,260
even force always stands missus cans

399
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,720
your a to to feed need to

400
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,890
or or or but they were too that produces
I'll useful for us

401
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,059
so for for us it doesn't really matter

402
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:05,530
that the person that is maintaining the
information it collects

403
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,040
doesn't really care about this
information came from so

404
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,110
you can't you really can have two
different teams

405
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,830
the team that is collecting data and 18
is maintaining

406
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:21,890
the results and does not make the
basement

407
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,750
it's very very decent generates reports
an extra reports

408
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,450
most costumes like this because they can
filter and sort

409
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,850
stock like they want and of course we
can do

410
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:37,270
traditional reports humor you
governments which includes

411
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:44,270
update them

412
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,930
two main reason why we didn't diss this
because

413
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,990
a.m. we do a lot of large-scale stems

414
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,470
penetration tests and a rely on his
behalf

415
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,620
efficiency to focus or time

416
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,120
on the penetration testing and
exploitation and we don't really care

417
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,390
for preventing grabbing

418
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,430
or collecting based data we have to

419
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,210
because that is the online information
for the exploitation so

420
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,670
okay a small as we can also managed to
collect basic

421
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,470
a task more time we will have to include
exportation and of course you can do

422
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,980
statistical analysis

423
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,390
you can do comparison for

424
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,820
for its on you can't compare different
hosts or different zones

425
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,600
I'm and most of our customers are you
happy to see a comparison

426
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,850
of competitors their competitors of
course you don't name

427
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,290
companies what you say okay you are

428
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,320
average lifeboat average of all private
banks

429
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,470
yet all the difference regarding
internet for a small nap

430
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,300
parks and especially management is very
happy to

431
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,600
have this information because only thing
day care is

432
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,870
comparison to other companies months
what's possible

433
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,050
in the mind security and of course

434
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,870
because it's a database we can do trend
and performance analysis

435
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,680
if you do same test again next year with
the same script so

436
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,870
slightly modified scripts you can say
okay

437
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:23,870
there better performance 1

438
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,800
here is an example of of ira church or
large-scale assessment roommates

439
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,760
more than 3,000 posts we have fun

440
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,890
more than 10,000 open ports ands

441
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,440
in im yen we have document that's

442
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,510
nearly 28,000 security issues and gets

443
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,820
really not possible to 22 reaches deal
it's not possible if you're running

444
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,980
you and Mac without for ornamentation

445
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,060
because it's it so much data you can't
this

446
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,620
I'm our approach is a very major step

447
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,520
scaling approach him you don't
outstanding customer sites

448
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,780
be trying to identify which hose
original and

449
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,110
so do a simple big-screen things mean of
tools

450
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,830
we do on traditional of open since game
only

451
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,040
to identify open ports numbers in
detection

452
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,630
know as is creeping no explanation just
as important game

453
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,890
im of difference for you a

454
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,540
an additional stem for the specific
ports and enabled version

455
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,970
texan our streams can be false truths we
have children

456
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,740
usually if we do a lot skills damn

457
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,670
a you come in contact with new products
never seen before

458
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,750
and you don't have as his prints for
their

459
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,220
to an array George exploits will be
decent new products

460
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,180
so of their step 3: improve our streets

461
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,320
and go back to at 3am do the same

462
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,670
for version vixen strips can again to
see

463
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,750
use treats are useful and generate more
data

464
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,100
and so the usually a.m. do step 3:

465
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,160
it's a very large scale project several
times

466
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,740
im and

467
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,790
to Ultima performance you have to

468
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,540
approach and be

469
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,820
be used guarantee results that means

470
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,460
if version detection is very dangerous

471
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,940
I'm and we can say of course because

472
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,970
of is resolute action there must be this
will be dirty we rely on that

473
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,990
on this the costumes a snow we want some
birder

474
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,840
verification regional very close lunch

475
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,390
on however is doing the Russian texan

476
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,240
the usually go through the database
answer

477
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,130
yet rated difference version fictional
grievance or

478
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,430
entries the GOP's of them's are more
action since on them

479
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:01,040
produce a lot false-positive and

480
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,620
having as the scripts are able to
preserve the results from

481
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,860
over script runs so if I made for
example

482
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,220
for I request

483
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,500
a santa hat request web server and got
the results and I used its results

484
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,310
for a week like this result even on the
streets I don't

485
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,820
check again of course use a result that
i've collected before

486
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,820
if that's true from

487
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,510
sold to someone who's moderates
interesting

488
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,650
Tennessee use I think a very important
part of

489
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,930
and a not that many people usage right
now

490
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:50,090
most heard of it but whenever I talk to
people that

491
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,800
and have the time to chat take a deeper
look at it I think it's a very much June

492
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,140
I'm I'd like to say to

493
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,220
embassy for Emma from the NC is is

494
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,890
doing what's necessary in Oslo was
impossible to do the last three years

495
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,950
works on not streets

496
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,550
are combining dates are and mochi and I
don't like that

497
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,080
no case we have logic condense the
streets

498
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,380
and to the gym the database so I'm very
happy with it

499
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm if you used output in external

500
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,570
up to the you can use a record to

501
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,770
produce really customized non-life up

502
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,900
and each step in and everybody plugins

503
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,590
improve the performance very very high
in

504
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,770
I know she their

505
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,650
jobs what's on one thing a

506
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,180
whatever you choose Emma you have at a
very lost his cousin

507
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,710
discussion if he wants to rely on that
matter and

508
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,120
are usually don't like to rely on other
projects because if there is a change or

509
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,820
the project nice you project might bite
you and

510
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,630
this dependency I don't really like but
that is a really great project from

511
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,560
clever people

512
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,660
like thankful for the efforts to put in
there for

513
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,780
for more more than 10 years

514
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,410
and and all the people on the mailing
list which helped the group

515
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,140
on their young scripps and is very
stable

516
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,500
and the development is very approached

517
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,140
so we real-life for

518
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,240
and often just talk we are going to
release of course these words

519
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,270
which is no surprise but we'll

520
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,450
release our top 10 will be the chances
group

521
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,080
you can throw them in your scripts
folder and do something like that what

522
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,150
top 10 scan and remove release a basic

523
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,510
our sandwiches a to parse XML to

524
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,690
CS me files so you can't

525
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,700
action sheet and especially if you have
March still stands

526
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,880
you can and will motivate them much
easier them

527
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,750
with the basic a and we will use it next
few days to reach

528
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,120
depends on how much we well you know now
projects

529
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,559
no web sites

530
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,260
done different resources on the Internet
and she is very

531
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,690
other options and I suggest or encourage
everyone to take

532
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,769
look this is very very good

533
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:29,159
if you have any questions

534
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,299
like Johns

535
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:40,320
everyone wants go home

536
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,120
often

537
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,830
it's not

538
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,030
well
