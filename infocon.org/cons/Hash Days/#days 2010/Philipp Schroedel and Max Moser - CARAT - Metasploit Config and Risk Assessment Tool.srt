1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,400
yeah by everyone so

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,570
we'll have just spoken English a

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,009
us there is 0 this shouldn't be a
problem I am

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,099
better it into a nice also

5
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:20,789
though I just recognize that we though
didn't include

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,520
president all but I'm I guess you will
find a

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,340
I'm be did told basically is about

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,570
at love him we have for him during the
last few

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,760
make you moan but that in fact it was
thinking of all days

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,530
coalition meeting I had a yeah he got
the following week or because the whole

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,219
issue

12
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,410
most really wrap stretch

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,829
K and I were why is it so

14
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,570
all about was this blog about we will
see that basically it's

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,010
rose includes yesterday because Lloyd
session a job handling

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,180
88 so this means that we can really

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,840
a stop to I'm test cases and this
includes

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
the functionality over over

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,600
exploitation pro-vote less to

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,590
'em to the bowel school

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,590
the price so

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,180
I'm me started the project

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,439
actually a of crime a.m.

24
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,100
we wanted to test some a

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,170
I N

26
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,210
on Gration

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,039
settings and stuff like that mary had
searched

28
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,509
different all across in these are big

29
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,829
their by means of this so

30
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,350
I'm we are testing dying I'm

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,289
year have to collect a large amount of
data on

32
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,390
yes too impressed and yes and ice them

33
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,349
visualize them

34
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,890
it rover reports and results

35
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,410
actual I'm actually so

36
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,220
forestal I S yes sir from OKC aids

37
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,269
tho a over

38
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,440
and with all of us the journal I you

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,569
testing and testing guy who is always

40
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,290
procedure testing of the wellies I'll

41
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,629
usually you're putting a lot of
information about up

42
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:42,150
testing and that you somehow have so is
lost

43
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,560
the old basic a I

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,900
you then so tried to is no

45
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,760
procuring cause and especially if you

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,930
sugar there's okay

47
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,959
if you look at secure the best I'm

48
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,130
there's a major problem if you want to

49
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,859
going to losses K the problem addressed
he usually is

50
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,389
it was quite easy the best Swansea W her

51
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:14,470
%um you the best possible thing with

52
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,500
identical a.m. his

53
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,510
it's quite different is that it's Katie
especially when are you going to

54
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,650
a never get my member you have different

55
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,299
platforms different boise is the firm

56
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,680
a it was mainly from the administrators
or

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,910
is quite challenging are and usually
he's

58
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,560
good option you after your pet insurance
maybe you have a few

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,739
procedures where you go and then you you

60
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,739
adopted I'm

61
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,730
during their you off

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,019
less and the market was a a very very
nice that the problem with also meant

63
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,569
St in bed is also or I'm

64
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,090
sup function at best or wanna be yes
ma'am

65
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,099
crime of just one thing that bothers you
the result so

66
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:11,170
as authorities tried for example that
being vetted phone services were

67
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,129
but no graphing about online system

68
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,019
or I have a network-based religious fine

69
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,460
but you don't get to go aggression box
rivets

70
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,510
correctly configure so I'm and then
there are some who visuals and verify

71
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,599
who is this aggression but

72
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:34,520
quite often does not a don't say

73
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,750
concentration out in my head looks like
so

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,229
because the longer you quite a lot of
specific needs

75
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,349
if you want to do that im means of

76
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:48,380
the and you want to test your security

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,099
both existing and Mesha actually
individual controls how well

78
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:56,479
the day bookended I'm up

79
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,950
yeah a one of the specific tests

80
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,750
which is not easily found most orders
for example something by

81
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,260
easy for you to be best yes thats cool
im about testing

82
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,530
so you want to verify that you all
restriction boys in the Explorer crosses

83
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,719
over actually work so

84
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:18,280
designs by DJ just go to the website
look as you've got the right on

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,180
but a you a hotel wish to report it for
some

86
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,940
locking the whole communication why are
you stalking is just because it comes or

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,070
yeah all is there i holed

88
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,450
and most difficult part is really

89
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,760
for effective efficiencies measurement

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,180
so which control was how effective

91
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,130
to risk firms solo be tried to obstruct

92
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,469
basically really a strap that holds a
good person so yeah something that will

93
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:51,510
be just us from

94
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,889
then awesome and fresh breath

95
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,940
a like you when you're done with will be
yes means and you didn't find your way

96
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,509
in

97
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:03,630
usually do additional tests this could
be a host the netbook

98
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,539
application all be

99
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,470
that's a search for stocks which is most
is gold automatic

100
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,289
because it's over no so this is usually
a

101
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm at all the and I mean it depends on
the scope

102
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,539
if you look for nasa where testing

103
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,919
Wymondham aggression as maybe you have
gotten

104
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,039
you need to gain access is this about
this choir

105
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,410
of missus will be your show I don't care
about mood is very

106
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,729
today a.m. but for sure you were
collector

107
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:44,060
she go to bed who assessment I have you
have to

108
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,379
to somehow consolidate information
generate reports and

109
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,470
everyone bitching doing Press know that

110
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,629
the revolving is than most impatience

111
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:57,819
Paul in fact it's not we

112
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,879
he revolt against the a profession
before you actually buy

113
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,800
the said so the know-how 3 was no

114
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,539
what your body so you what is going
wrong there

115
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,240
and I'm and daschle

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,979
right reports also know that I mean
that's

117
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,840
depends on your skill set and use the
open your mind and you have to be there

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,849
is room

119
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,930
assist them to gain further access time

120
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:31,160
can access to a I'm a sec you'll bless
those who can be goes through that too

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,039
cute to go for additional information

122
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,300
user stuff like that this really depends
on

123
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,030
on the scope but that's basically what
was the other very high level

124
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:47,030
best test as well

125
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,130
okay

126
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,200
so this is a how we our idea

127
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,270
I V lead the whole same

128
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,490
I am the first thing you have to do is

129
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,330
a to get access to the client you want
to test

130
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,850
any is and the simply by executing a
program

131
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,480
or 10 the machines

132
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,910
to an exploit maybe or

133
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,050
XQ you are logging straight or

134
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,830
as office fusion mechanism so ever

135
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,010
ivory which has to be executed on the
climb

136
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,830
this is actually also different in most
up

137
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,160
most of them are based on a agent each
lost the install

138
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,250
highly privileged constantly growing

139
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,210
both reforming open ports and probably
also

140
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,170
Mobility's right next to you

141
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,180
so basically I'm collects

142
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,200
things though and this overlooks up

143
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,470
forget about this case and I mean that's
really did you see

144
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,750
and the rest is basically about major
tho them

145
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,920
life so I'm you can basically

146
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,320
passed a resolution to be executed and

147
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm yeah yen

148
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,170
Press already started from so from the
times I

149
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,450
which allows it to collect information
bows by you

150
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,910
I'm if you have purity ask him

151
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,250
is the JD from Asia Asia so was both
move on to the local

152
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,890
all the first one so your basic we will
have some examples reagan

153
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,890
is busy to yes that you collect does

154
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,160
Usenet upside and lol and then you

155
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,830
collected data yup

156
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,220
then actually on every thing is
collected by the server

157
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,340
at the moment is toward exam I'll

158
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,660
and then you for me

159
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,910
things out the base space or

160
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,020
this is open home

161
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,120
it's a easy to change it you know I

162
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,200
to ambassador

163
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,370
I yes those are both cost is coming to
an end

164
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,370
we have some examples here but that's
basically what's up bro

165
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,040
is completely up to you out you so he
fire

166
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,339
no using Metasploit to gain access
that's what they believe provide yellow

167
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,620
the from their villages meaning there
are over

168
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,730
makes very so I'm so all sides

169
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,750
all legitimate Joe PHP

170
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,260
genocide they're suppose x1 available so

171
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,970
if you'll get access to it you okay
thank you basically

172
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,470
is outside after major player in 20 so

173
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,710
that's basically well you know I'm
basing all along on the server side

174
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,370
on Clyde which will be up there I means
pretty

175
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,810
crazy but I'm so especially if so I

176
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,020
working on the I loans test I am

177
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,710
than I'm may just over by

178
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,360
on their core obscenities fire services
upload/download

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,610
which is the UK you and I recall a big
baby I

180
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,710
once again a special memory I am

181
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,550
basically whatever it's not that easy

182
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,980
always both and provides the framework
can be

183
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,280
usually a.m.

184
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,370
job basically yeah I just extending

185
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,230
the the may just go have a look great
though languish

186
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,330
by for abstract in its so right see

187
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,400
law test cases which administrator
should be

188
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,920
able to do so a is not always that easy

189
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,800
implemented natively using movable skits
I had in fact the session and the most

190
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,660
complete game is

191
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,480
those sounds like Bolton absolutely

192
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,710
I mean yes sponsored by city

193
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,950
exactly botnet with the control center I
it's kind of strange to

194
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,829
the bad guy so I actually having that
already probably a

195
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,860
the market out there is quite as the
between

196
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,950
compliance verification and woman
because I definitely between those

197
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,230
much for example products for
configuration

198
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,600
validation about it blackout by Rawal

199
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,640
at the moment I mean even all the
products on existing hey

200
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,910
all replaced by a a very cool compliance
gun which

201
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,540
actually cannot even handle anymore
simple verification of registry keys

202
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,230
though I'm it's really strange that the
market doesn't have

203
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,510
such products available which on all
warm

204
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:53,540
oil extreme expense solve the next few
slides describe the mutual

205
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,620
components I guess we can just explained
by from

206
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,040
pictures so we don't lose contest yeah

207
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,070
I am so as we said I am

208
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,630
.1 is the on-site excusable

209
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,290
on is yes executed a

210
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,560
me review session gone expect the

211
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,810
make a slight frame for of that their

212
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,230
are applauding thanks over the session
looks

213
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,480
I'll into database face on him

214
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,550
I G on a Mac other s or see your address
of the client which is connecting

215
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,950
what jobs those the client has

216
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,990
executing I'm release these

217
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,230
and place a from a every single

218
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,410
instruction I O called an instruction
virus based is just as a

219
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,579
instructions I would call it that way

220
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,680
I'm yeah often suffer

221
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,420
it's getting instructions both sides can
actually execute SKS

222
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,300
so Italy so side can

223
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,400
base here attack I and all the time I'm

224
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,900
collect information this allows you also
some complex cases like about investing

225
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,770
by him yup them

226
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,630
when we collect the results and we have
another component maybe im

227
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,760
name K like that and I am

228
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,620
in our raw or Dixon I'll 54 called

229
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,110
all that Jobs heirs executors which
actually films

230
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,150
the report other today

231
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,760
both highly configurable

232
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,820
the whole life you lost to North limited
he ABC

233
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,230
by a even instructions that which is for
sale

234
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,850
less the beginning we thought we got his
eye colour less

235
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,089
college like very fiery

236
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,209
usable in and we decided that Jens
through

237
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:58,709
jajaja lightyear I just put some we call
the

238
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,120
only functions so very small business
functions

239
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,339
wish to for example of the old town of
stuff like that like

240
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,339
in me to brief us I'll yes tractors or
is easy I'm

241
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,720
you don't have to take your own boss
stuff like that

242
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
and to allow the end the users out there
for flexibility of using that

243
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,310
Mitchell miles an hour yes Greek
language style which would be easier to

244
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,230
handle

245
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,350
is that I was a more flexible way

246
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,270
pass on to all this that you have you
can foresee because sometimes you have

247
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,459
to write more stay

248
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:34,000
most statements but you can save them
inside use them as a

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,560
module do not access if you like you
know about

250
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,570
I on the other hand I'm we can make his
own

251
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,930
whole thing platform any them so it
doesn't matter to you all

252
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,890
know the I'll order calm on doesn't the
food

253
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:55,940
home and one system to another so if you
all notified all units it looks the same

254
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,030
I like I'll I not no its own freight

255
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,260
session I'm basically decide from there
on this session

256
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,270
which going on yes him

257
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,190
so ice skate know the individual
components

258
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,030
so basically a I got it looks like
they're diagnosis so

259
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,900
the thermal prepare us basic his own
storage locations

260
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,600
chest all for jobs and I am

261
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,890
the Legos instruction to be executed
because I at the instruction to itself

262
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,819
to be executed and yen days ago
collectives

263
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,850
and reports and the generations

264
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,300
and in this case review from the time
but we can be generated

265
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,579
people I'm

266
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,910
why did you decide to move knots a
building

267
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,220
too many coleman's nakedly I

268
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,680
II was the it's because we wanted to

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,900
to move the not the ACE

270
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,030
usage of specifically for example maybe
a company doesn't like that use

271
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,309
this guy actions that scandal I'm all

272
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,620
you have a specific software testing
functional yes it will let you like to

273
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,130
be

274
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,579
uploaded and executed automatically if
someone commits

275
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,069
I'm you can easily change that so
basically all the

276
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,280
all the land mines on all the included
in the frame

277
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,500
that I'm a hustler test cases over
better

278
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,940
fighting we use most of the time from
church is over

279
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,690
your available on the on their a system
but it's your choice if you want for

280
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,660
example to use out yesterday

281
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,420
I don't know you exist in an executed in
victory bowl to collect information

282
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,520
I'm that's not out all a

283
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,250
scold to take care on on what you
actually do that six

284
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:57,250
to the scope of the person who tries to
test case

285
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:03,980
yeah if you are looking on some examples
what we can do

286
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,399
this is blocking for I am

287
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,700
one thing is the and I'm J

288
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,809
by and registry entries

289
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,940
make cash piece of them I'm something
like

290
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,039
35 dog actually so

291
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,730
we can I integrity the system

292
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,019
so if you have a system set up we can't
stand it long time

293
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,470
and I really periodically

294
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,850
of the words and compare different
exxon's

295
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,029
of the different buyers already and it's
not only you only you

296
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:42,269
conflagration best thing you can also
make phone so and

297
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,919
expected phone service testing all for
example issue

298
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,429
as a development the the name this day

299
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,629
vikes you can buy some test cases which

300
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:55,749
always a me amended a.m.

301
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:59,889
doing testing procedures that these
blogs not be implemented into

302
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,139
versions of the same play right one SKS

303
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:07,529
a good example is as well I'm I mean a
lot of people using

304
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:11,779
overseas do with them but in fact for
example the policy is not complete yet

305
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,129
by the registry

306
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:17,429
especially if you are if you're using
law machine Best Buy

307
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:22,059
for okay so you can for example provided
what is the fire

308
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:25,080
which is available on YouTube a but you
can

309
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,970
for some verify I usually watch the
actual registration thing

310
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,269
against the intended thirties of the

311
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:36,350
to of the policy so you can differ
basically I'm

312
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,639
if I and what will happen you the

313
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:45,369
policy is switched off or you can apply
to certain setting what's the setting of

314
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:45,749
the

315
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:49,460
system itself so one single

316
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,720
a than ever %uh might self-esteem

317
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,389
it's a by well known in terms of culture

318
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:03,419
St Helens on those cases out there on we
don't gotta go

319
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:08,460
that's so in here you will be
implemented so for

320
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,059
is also possible that %uh the bow the
remote system and fasted for the remote

321
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,009
site and get information back

322
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:18,580
well you can especially if you have over
investors

323
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,779
specific one inspect memory esche Japan

324
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:26,840
making processes whatever you like I
still have the control

325
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,659
on the tires out what information is
actually drawn through

326
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:34,649
and so can keep control of today
adjustment

327
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:38,119
so that's right addressing but the

328
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:41,450
waiting to that one them

329
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,690
I one example I also would like to
mention

330
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,830
is about forensic so

331
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,150
if you're have to analyze this is them

332
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,520
a after breaking yeah

333
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,370

337
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,330
overusing random

338

341
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,740
if I 17 search also appearances

342
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,220

343
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,490
the all offer a

344
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,630

execute something that I'll process
that's quite okay

348
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,330
so you don't have to actually upload and
install the whole binary

349
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,250
they also may be patient about us I

350
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,090
will so you don't have to be although
yeah every time

351
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,720
I am

352
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,390
really its basically explained by step
you take them

353
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,400
examples so we are staying down tests
all plays out like you would on the

354
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,650
times in a long list of things

355
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,860
I'll at all I'm and I will get some
lists

356
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,260
isley of both on that I can get the

357
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,020
progression of the law if I will ever
exam hey

358
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,200
I can excuse and netbooks came from the
outside as well

359
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,300
bonzo so I mean

360
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,800
best possible a cool thing is that I

361
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,030
and I stop it from one location the repo
is not that I can collect that

362
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,890
information

363
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,910
me showing yes its by challenging

364
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,420
by those a.m. test cases but you do it
once

365
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,390
I anyhow you at Thursday's you can see
the executors

366
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,620
this case this volume and national
executes

367
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,800
a servo a make a big deal

368
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,480
so component I mean that's pretty
obvious

369
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,240
in your direction outbound thats

370
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,790
cobble together follow order these days
and spicy

371
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,000
you yeltsin

372
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,890
or service that media all-state last two
games on

373
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,210
name resolution soul you alls

374
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,940
the local install Internet Explorer for
example were sold idea to call more

375
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,200
or leveled off bomb I

376
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,560
then is working me I can get the file
corporation

377
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,420
at settings Beach makes connection

378
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,320
won't get blocked on the client I'll and
then

379
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,730
the of plan to actually all the
connections

380
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,420
to very servers on on the car also

381
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,600
over and and we can verify is

382
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,050
things so in this example I i

383
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,410
would be possible for the next door

384
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,050
who gets whom beauty ever look calm

385
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,730
but a song title firewall

386
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,130
adrian is blocking saw this allows a
voter making assumptions about the whole

387
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,060
convo

388
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,260
brought that website so is not over
making

389
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,430
Bay or you can use it for evaluating you
over to the white listing of your boxes

390

overall

391
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,520
network boundaries stuff like that so

392
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I'll reactor 0

393
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:46,240
this

394
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:54,930
well switch you know models

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,080
earth

521
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,400
chip on

522
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,000
have phone stream

523
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,000
percent below that about testing

524
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,480
so again same so

525
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,920
just execute say excuse but yeah

526
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,230
because not as if not his restaurant is

527
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:46,880
so

528
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,780
again the best books children's play is
quite a

529
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,200
crazy to its is this video the message
okay

530
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,840
it took so long I mean through a few
articles lately

531
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,360
other for a confrontation I don't I'm
exclude

532
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,640
are no one I'm did not investigate

533
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,140
other really need I and II Zeta

534
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,290
I in that case scenario which saw first
two walks the dogs if you want to submit

535
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,140
those lawyers and the shows that you can
use buy windows

536
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,870
basically as well so I was always very
yes even

537
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,670
and slightly modified actually be hot
and humid

538
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,090
shows he say all the requests coming in

539
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:33,930
and its

540
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:40,930
him

541
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:50,530
a.m.

542
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,090
through this 1 if you look at that
instruction

543
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:57,150
by either amid

544
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:03,290
K

545
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:10,290
so GM

546
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,150
so if you look at that time for example
by easy I mean

547
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,690
I have to made a different file or yup
on testing a year

548
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:28,110

551
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,670
on annual had time to that may be using
right on so I'm

552
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,200
efficient placement which calls and a
little slow

553
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,530
but because I don't I'm I'm not

554
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:52,420
a death of at the moment when I'm make a
play for like at night very very slowly

555
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,080

outcall movie would be saved into were

565
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:36,130
very deeply

566
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,580
Saucony we you just full

567
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,510
simplicity I adjusted to regress which
were collected

568
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,450
I sent three those

569
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,270
3 home I good I hands

570
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,360
I slightly modified to recall

571
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,110
generation to to collect that
information and

572
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:05,110
but I Noga this report

573
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,470

575
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,010
Expo I G I'm just the

576
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,440
while were was super was see

577
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,869
Yahtzee well www.porn

578
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:29,810
a surveillance problems no cash advance
on

579
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,470
okay I am and I

580
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,810
group of the bus so and now you can add
further information by

581
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,900
congressional I like that this just

582
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,190
what was then was received somewhere to
go

583
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,670
so vision %um

584
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:53,660
more complicated mileage good so

585
00:39:53,660 --> 00:40:00,660
the most fun

586
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,340
yeah

587
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:13,230
don't

588
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:20,220
mom

589
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:27,220
so a joke so you know I am basically is
something like a

590
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:39,350
in something I've gotta show on some
collectio problems reissue

591
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,760
I feel better for example use a Asia

592
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,180
and cool

593
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,490
we should collect you and the five
without actually write music

594
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,740
is using utf-8 don't need rosa's email
rejection

595
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,990
concept of problem is that you cannot
provide I am

596
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,040
arguments to that specific one a

597
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,390
moment these hoes men and soul

598
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,980
I had to not look at first excuse me for
them

599
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,530
so basically it's just collect some some
passions

600
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,690
adjust

601
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,770
going to be roll director info

602
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:22,080
but you got me in the right now are you
going to

603
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,190

the revising to that aren't you have
made a slow

614
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:09,580
on blocking a why is this upgrades which
in a few

615
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:14,300
using only L made us know if and also
that's

616
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,850
you are well just all information in

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,950
at moments buzzed and buzzed Gautam for

624
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:49,010
beginning I i mean I guess you get the
idea of

625
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,270
I'm individual jobs remove it

626
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,290

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,950
the results will be and include and
their results are actually

629
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,560
and for example dunya 37 as you can see
you can have multiple

630
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,260
I mean if you want to say best Triesman
on think you

631
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,560
don't want alright test when the next
one so you have some differences

632
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,210
so we make some I'm unique ongoing

633
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:24,050
avital jewelers lots a woman I'm

634

00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,080
expenses may be different make burgers a

641
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,400
a separate databases that can connect

642
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,750
long database on database

643
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,910
yeah

644
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,090
yeah

645
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,210
following this user is a even only a
native

646
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,630
well the so while trees

647
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,190
year the Swedish language very around
XML

648
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,250
for you fine test cases for women
believe he's from

649
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,480
racism and I'm

650
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,720
compliance checks I am the nice thing is
that sprays

651
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,660
you wanna be my get every month you has
jazz

652
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,370
believability if so you don't have to
buy them Leone

653
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,360
at the moment you can easily take their
the folks who

654
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,530
the phone there for from their website

655
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,560
uploaded I you select another like but
we

656
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,150
think that it makes absolutely no sense
to to at least

657
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,100
allow users are you saying man we should
be fired his case

658
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,260
because I want you're lazy I'm

659
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,090
one save other from I am though is very

660
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:09,020
was a lot of time in terms of mister
cutie all combines

661
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:13,680
for example there are tests for is there
a USB device driver

662
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,870
so I don't have to read I am

663
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,120
the next thing is the both of us action
to implement a

664
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,250
for you the problem is that the time is
over

665
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,150
the over the phone not available and now
it's available so

666
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,730
should be easy task just made that up
and routing of the

667
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,110
cool im which is based in los dos are
you

668
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:40,950
because a it's just that for easy
management job yes that you have

669
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,970
all your test cases and guys and you can
choose which instructions you want

670
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,570
russia and I thank you

671
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,610
I'm other following or

672
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,660
problem is I that although you is that
you all

673
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,520
craft to know what you actually saw it
just helps you by providing you

674
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,060
as shit no nothing more nothing less

675
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,130
does not that fancy but provides exactly
the missing piece

676
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,840
between using a individual make a
playlist it's an adopted two different

677
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,640
scenarios

678
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,660
to forgot my using the our ritual

679
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,350
if you know I'm

680
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,490
arm I have two questions over

681
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:30,060
yes it can be abused and yes it provides
you some

682
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,710
is a cutie I me is up to you through

683
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,950
exploitation activities of middle
schoolers you don't like it

684
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,980
I'm there is a as a sizable

685
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,900
available which always generates annual
certificates maybe not the intended use

686
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,750
in that case

687
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,270
but you can usually I used to provider

688
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:52,670
their defined as as a goes on and
everyone can but I am

689
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:56,660
and a.m. yeah well and Adam

690
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,820
for sure these your problem it's complex
and use rights

691
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,300
but the cool thing is you cram abuse
cases through your

692
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,840
I'm environments for example you can
verify first

693
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,930
was it to me regional on your system

694
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:15,190
owner radio system always the

695
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,360
a PHP version running inside of the

696
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Westerville a.m. process so you don't
have to

697
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,260
that much tribulation you can easily
that and react accordingly

698
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,680
and I'm your

699
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,810
thats you'll thing about I'm

700
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,290
back and unloaded I'm we did not manage
to

701
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,480
ir implemented yet

702
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,560
the kids open at the moment so it's

703
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,460
still the hang on sht I'm

704
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,090
GI generation problem revenge arena
basing their

705
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,010
I just during the next few days as you
need access

706
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,990
a just so many men %uh key volume

707
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,030
them just get out of the gates

708
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,540
a.m. bands very straightforward and
simple moving

709
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,630
we don't use I'm too much objects
orientation program

710
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,140
because it simply the make sense in that
context because you're one object as the

711
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,270
session

712
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:23,890
and the rest is basically operating
talked on US-russian so

713
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,050
yes us on both sides for you the whole
to really bright

714
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:32,250
I and II if you want to about this case
