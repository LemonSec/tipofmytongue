1
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,590
so high here sex money talks about them

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,980
but created wary of using

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,689
I'm boats as and already mentioned

4
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:20,340
what they do have a present an hour we
will be made

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,190
the generous grant the short

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,539
so I'm just about me

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,900
this is relishing I'm

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,050
working as this and protectees

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,100
their 41 of these

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,399
minson but that's actually made a job
there's also some

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,520
not nice job but that's right the

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,660
naming but dumb also want to talk today
announced he said

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,899
watching actors and

14
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,570
the must be reason why

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,659
there's normal one

16
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,700
he drove it worked a few times before
its

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,630
learn how to act to make room finds out
that I am

18
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,070
method state rules to download the

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,150
zero-day don't know well there

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,490
that's not really know

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,049
you like that before some yeah and then
you go home

22
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,130
and said okay what a lot of

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,420
so that they're just a pain in the neck

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,540
and mom weighing on slap about them

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,850
problems

26
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,780
some you're talking to who

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,430
and that's actually a cheapo don't know
if you heard before

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,159
now but that'll be four its and normal
honey pot

29
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,960
it's not the web-based its showbuzz

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,789
and to keep other name them

31
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:04,170
think it's quite clear what it means and

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,450
the features are in Lakewood for normal

33
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,640
on pubs of a file system you can match
fake

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,430
a.m. find content like also try:

35
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,610
them leather and

36
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,870
it also stores everything you you aren't
yet action download service wk

37
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,260
that's their sealed a park just so

38
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,840
for we can analyze them out later on
a.m.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,640
just or so everything but

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,840
after he also had the some features of
the author and the song impeaches

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,180
which are really cool and the knife
other honey pots have the same features

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,400
but they're a few fun features it dust
storms session

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,840
in that format you can replay so you can
see

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,120
how it works what they time in and it's
in real time

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,920
that the replacer really see if he had
mistyped

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,019
mispells: I'll phosphate I'm

47
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,560
center yes says collects

48
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,290
slaughter hosts it actually collects the

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,579
nothing it acts like it won't connect
but it stays on the same shell

50
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,350
and even more funny yes it does not
really excellent

51
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,670
but that's just clears the screen and

52
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,810
acts like it was beyond your calls but
they're

53
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,959
the attack still stays on the same homes
and

54
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,840
I don't have anything over ninety about
that there are some loss you have

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,060
ratios there you can see SS connects to
another host

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,190
your name a.m. to us the more tests than

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,509
accent next host stage connect and

58
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:54,790
detect it doesn't really recognize that
that's all this is our most

59
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,489
up some

60
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,989
I am you then fold let's

61
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,720
traits on website and started

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,130
site a.m. very %um

63
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,419
solvent just the same let's bash or

64
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,509
or am SMS from guest

65
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,639
nuts i think is that turn lesser

66
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,850
messages Sunday you know that's right

67
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,259
yeah we thought okay let's just uploads

68
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,360
attacks and then have to use assaults

69
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,790
on a.m. keeping I'm

70
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,250
I want that tax RR a student attacks are

71
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,340
I V ness started the subway this year

72
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,870
with the cents looked it looked like
love life

73
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,259
films like this hefty the leading up
there

74
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm it it's really looks the same right
to delete the other sites and image

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,389
or a.m. 17

76
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,300
strange them %um am

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,860
accident program yeah shell and the

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,110
G pancho comes with a Ajax her

79
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,610
I'm some very weird stuff there you have
to have a observer said you have to

80
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,210
a.m. a a shell and then on the website
you have an HX tournament that connects

81
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,840
to the

82
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,820
to the server and Jim actually have a
live session on the server very to

83
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,620
replace the whole session

84
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,590
and thought if you have a such a website
ratio makes fun of attackers

85
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,470
and that you are in position to machine
on the network

86
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,470
the name was mentioned before or after
very be German

87
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,900
the address provided which I hope it's
more or less

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,210
does prove a.m. sorry thought

89
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,050
less done often and your balls let's
just my

90
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,569
HTTP days or JavaScript a single

91
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:56,870
its own growth there show which says
that relates

92
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,420
or loss like a normal shown but
basically it said text area

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,560
and its search oskar a

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,389
thats I'm or

95
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:13,450
I'm incarcerated I guess

96
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:20,450
in like and all the money

97
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:31,230
you

98
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,370
not really better to

99
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,820
that new just miss the feel

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,430
a first few lines usually airlock what
kind of machine is it

101
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,520
what are great we have it without time
do you have to be up times quite

102
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,870
important to

103
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,210
isn't it will be applied over and you

104
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,180
well control a.m. then there's the

105
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,400
Microsoft home loans where yeah right to
die without the service pack 3

106
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,670
then usually do is to see how fast is
the

107
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,970
now playing and then a.m.

108
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,450
just clears

109
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,580
the locks he tries to to hide his tracks

110
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,390
and I guess a at the bottom

111
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,520
there's you name to see what kind of
system memory on

112
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,850
and

113
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:36,500
them and their son

114
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,560
I think you're offended you wrote an
exit

115
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,140
and now he's still the same machine but
it doesn't recognize

116
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,150
and then he recollects and you machine
server

117
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:53,150
accused tries to do so and it really
acts did you have fun three acts as if

118
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,800
it's a

119
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,430
collecting another machine it up also I
think a tax of course

120
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm then

121
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,990
you name again just to see what kind of
machine on my own

122
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:18,990
then pls a jealous rage Emirates a real

123
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,700
rely on Russian another I don't know
that

124
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,220
but this time for some are rare

125
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,780
and the funny part is you now tries to
on packets

126
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:37,780
up there doesn't get the name right

127
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,700
as it takes quite some time

128
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,130
transponder since 2002 think about

129
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,470
what's the last attack to write in that
moment think

130
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,410
him the

131
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,860
now it tries to go to pump iron his
mother

132
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,180
interest so called I i think it's some
kind of pot or something

133
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,380
he wants to work a.m. make run

134
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,310
and this a honeypot its second-biggest
to just

135
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,160
outputs on Star Wars there well or
something

136
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,140
every time right tries to run a an
application or by any

137
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,800
there honey pot doesn't know but so I'm

138
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,140
there also is quite confused the

139
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,170
of this as Sam Star Wars

140
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,390
quotes that its rise in ninety two CO
what happens

141
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,770
anti-trust to let the user

142
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,270
this won't work but it doesn't say it
doesn't work

143
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,420
it just has a segmentation fault or
anything

144
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,330
but only at the end so there are some
attacks which tried to

145
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,510
use our acts the for by

146
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,300
sex seven times as always that chance
there's

147
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,850
segmentation fault some other error

148
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,870
and that the attack despite how some
sometime attention just right six times

149
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,570
at the time

150
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,710
okay

151
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,920
I will bit know that them so outcome

152
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,750
well their plans now we have stuff to
'em

153
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,850
more or less with holds up a website
very fast %um

154
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,070
so not marry a pretentious shell and
polish

155
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,230
I'm a.m. that the real

156
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,320
or two main problem is that the locks
that contain songs I'm

157
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,340
SK characters or something a.m.

158
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,730
among climate control characters
halftime lead to Charles Street it's

159
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,500
like

160
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,130
left she or clear screen or something
like that

161
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,240
and did that takes quite some time

162
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,490
to to for instance command sent to
implement them

163
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,030
Johns Creek although the JavaScript it
solves

164
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,560
quite short if you look at the website
that the source file you will see that

165
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,510
is quite short

166
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,360
that demolition are law says the idea
for an

167
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,320
geolocation welcome back to the stalking
and that the

168
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,130
the main program is also having its own
automation to

169
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,320
top 20 scripts apparently it's how's
work

170
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,580
we 10:50 a.m. native

171
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,510
looking for and via me reform up to

172
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,930
you restricted to chart a strip Terry
just at it then

173
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,930
on the website which is all Mon were and
perhaps they're seeing somebody in here

174
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,010
was a great idea an hour made just

175
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,600
context one of the IDS is this

176
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,630
there is a I'm hours main source at the
moment was there

177
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,650
are few installations from asserting
their Europe

178
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,520
a.m. this is a a matter yeah I'm

179
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,060
did you hear about that 57 honeypots

180
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,150
traits every 24 hours or something and

181
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,500
yes teddy's Eyed Peas attempting to log
into the one-pot

182
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,850
say yellow ones the orange ones which

183
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,720
the means I had been successfully locked
a book didn't detract

184
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,350
the the red ones

185
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,480
these a.m. entered Commons on up

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,660
so alright yes 20 this must be somebody
in here

187
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,950
sirens were sup are you still

188
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,090
to just take on on one of these items
around December Marcus

189
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,280
and they're not only get the IP but also
to just lay

190
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,670
to yet to the script itself so you can
see him

191
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,570
a voted yet actress in Switzerland

192
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,010
work under the attacks in germany were
games the same amounts

193
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,940
idea the stupidest the other one so

194
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,330
that's one of our DST to get some
traction on the system

195
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,070
okay

196
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,190
I hope coming

197
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,440
10 plus at entrance left some questions
eyes

198
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,440
I still have another script if you like
show

199
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,890
relation around every

200
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,420
more all a.m.

201
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,240
show relations only two player you mean
TDM leche

202
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,490
for the Campo am jest ok people

203
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,390
this SEM their suspect early jobs

204
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,580
and setting up the host that can take a
live system

205
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,380
and still keep up the great demolition
of that life system

206
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,740
for a honeypot a like that you can use a
master's

207
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,880
books and just an act as if you are a
voice over IP books

208
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,840
a.m. it also lets all sides you would
like to have

209
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,390
so it really looks like resist and it
always looks the same

210
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:26,090
the next january connect to the same
homes here

211
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,520
next it stays the same

212
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,750
that's the fun part most of the guys
attacking

213
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,480
don't really recognize well as attacking

214
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,690
courts are system and they don't
recognize

215
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,360
hisham

216
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,290
not UK funky/uk

217
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,800
the speech changes if you download but
they're okay

218
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,570
a in yankee

219
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,070
just the same better process

220
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:07,070
same uses the same all search for said

221
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,430
know that changes as well but the rest
is

222
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,390
more or less the same that Dagg file

223
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,550
it its it's quite a.m.

224
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,830
it's not that difficult to change a
thing it's just a bunch of

225
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,010
I constricts and and a few over

226
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,080
text files and tracks new quonset just
that new text

227
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,160
first time place and some lines of code

228
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,200
and then you have to you new host to to
have fun

229
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,320
so our questions are tried to verify

230
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,360
love film

231
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,900
up there was one there's a.m.

232
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:57,900
and please stay McDonald

233
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,350
fans

234
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,480
there was another them

235
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,640
like call that

236
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,350
doesn't find along because it doesnt
know im a

237
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,040
up to get that then but for a.m.

238
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,470
this was recalled

239
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,690
first is in a better one about it wasn't
able to find

240
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,620
a.m. birth Jack trice chases same

241
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,210
this number hrs right doesn't work

242
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,240
%uh yes doesn't work then YUM and

243
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,420
I'm not sure if it was that local
repository fun but

244
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,460
first objective test it what kind of
distribution is it

245
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,190
and it said that their in as far as a No
then the child octets

246
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,320
it didn't work did it tries to download
act

247
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,350
with YUM grand

248
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,460
just very fun doesn't her

249
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,300
WX the doesn't really work because he
entered

250
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,980
gone wrong a.m.

251
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,160
them

252
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,160
there's I'll

253
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,910
then he tries to onto our his archives
archives just our moments but

254
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,040
unfortunately

255
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,300
he missed to enter name often of Trk

256
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,379
it works in the second round and then

257
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,500
this hose this recall because

258
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,360
tries to run the called you just
downloaded

259
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,920
and then this strict just that Prince de
Sol

260
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,290
and they all really National Park

261
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,900
him I'm that's all really returns

262
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,070
all-time except yes and yes

263
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,310
I and then you answered yes

264
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,550
well-kept a no way a

265
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,290
and there are some attacks which try try

266
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,740
and try and strike there's also a loss
and no way

267
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,660
that's right yes

268
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,140
why no buckle their

269
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,460
a again

270
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,680
the attack tries to remove a.m.

271
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,650
dream of his a.m. its footprint on the
system

272
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,960
what's called to see if also tops
message

273
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,389
brings back a.m.

274
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:47,110
one not found to check must use some
kind of strange story copy paste or

275
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,889
something it just run through

276
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:53,710
doesn't matter if it works on that host
or not you probably heard somewhere that

277
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,960
it works like this

278
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,100
but a.m. don't really understand but

279
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,039
just don't know and

280
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:10,039
them and dependents

281
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,450
but sure why he'd

282
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,630
first DS his traces

283
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,800
and then Anderson you come on I'm

284
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,820
few

285
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,900
units left for for all

286
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,960
well

287
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,960
need for compulsory them

288
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:56,030
and probably labor bubbles

289
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:17,259
is a treatable No

290
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:26,710
home

291
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:38,369
then

292
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,390
I actually it's more or less the same
dress download

293
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,350
a.m. this binary I

294
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,510
doesn't buy it her than they think

295
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,809
he tries to download for I'm

296
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:58,330
assurance a

297
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:05,330
efforts like apt-get just download the
whole package

298
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:22,890
quite big package

299
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,860
that's one of the problems manufacture
just looks the same

300
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,460
it's interesting to learn a they

301
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,700
first trying to find out what machine is
how fast internet is

302
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,240
that the uplink but them to refinance
the funny parts in it you have to sift

303
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,810
through

304
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,860
tons lot finest to find

305
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,430
yep just the fun parts like

306
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,720
nice trying to on city all times

307
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,560
not cause another ass Star Wars

308
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:19,560
quote

309
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,840
Scotland yep

310
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,330
the host the honeypot

311
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,580
Peyton good

312
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,200
though they really want to have usual
it's Linux

313
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,830
take one

314
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,320
the

315
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,029
yeah this him don't get

316
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,279
download them well does he actually

317
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,570
downhill the original yeah over so you

318
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,500
yeah yeah ok you start it both

319
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,549
you can leave the whole state when they
try to exit

320
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,809
them she you try the or do you

321
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,590
