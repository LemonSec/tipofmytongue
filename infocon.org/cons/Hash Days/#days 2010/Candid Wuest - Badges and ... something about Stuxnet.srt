shoes he their people out of misery sooo

606
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,730
clear indication that was is rather a
just

607
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,450
showing peters et al. math class

608
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,920
you know how are you a

609
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,100
would be could be also that it's I
actually a national

610
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,400
or my argues argue is

611
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,410
I just got my memory yes I was of news
for

612
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,170
remote units so I R

613
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:29,100
actually makes I'm no big deal love that

614
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,150
if my daughter's a

615
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,420

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,170
way I'm a that ABS

617
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,680
very own Boston

618
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,700
or not only probably never you know a

619
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,810
I speculate that s Broadway wrong track

620
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,390
referee and actually on a one using a

621
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,400
here or maybe just because

622
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,380
they don't get somewhere and any
objectors

623
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,650
any I was outsource

624
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,710

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,780
at that is by situation by

647
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,220
love the media no a was

648
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,560
so all we know it on speculation

649
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,890
a all the say it was being made as

650
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,170
gave up really don't get it %uh we see
mothers
