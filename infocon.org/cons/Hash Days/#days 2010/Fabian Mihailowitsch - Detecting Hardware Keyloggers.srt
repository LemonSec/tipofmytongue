1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,149
yeah so

2
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:12,380
let me introduce myself my name's

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,150
Stadium hi mesh I'm a form of software

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,330
develop of 48 German energy combine
currently I'm

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,380
working ass IT security consultant

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,930
for a German consulting company on

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,250
you're a sec I'm during impression tests
of

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,320
on offense yeah general stuff and if you
want to contact me

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,559
you can find my contact details at the
bottom of slots

10
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,940
so what are we going to talk about today

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,019
your going to talk about hot where
lockerz

12
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:53,080
basically ps2 and use baselines

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,379
for in general people 3

14
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:00,540
they are undetectable by software and
cannot be detected

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,809
if you look for example FB

16
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,900
yeah you can find an ice floe visual
inspections

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,579
primary means of detecting affect
loggers since there are no known methods

18
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,670
of detecting them

19
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,490
software however I'm today I'm gonna
show you must you techniques

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,320
how are you actually can't detect hot my
face longer since all

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,659
where and us yeah basically what talks
follow

22
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,960
why did I do to hold stock

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,549
basically because there has been done
mess research

24
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,090
on topic if you tried to google how to
detect hardware

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,520
QRS you can find less information about
that

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,329
and currently there is no practical way
known

27
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,759
to detect them however

28
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,350
they are threats there's that nice
example in the year 2005

29
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,609
that wasn't busy and thats each way back

30
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:59,420
where attack us try to see you 423

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,729
million US dollars by paying between
soft be more about to install

32
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,369
of murky waters and boss retrieve
password Sam

33
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,970
yet right break into the back button
made some of you guys

34
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,629
already have at incident with pot rack
you are seeing your company

35
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,349
ands yeah so on one day

36
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,190
just mark came up to me and asked them
how much you detect hardware

37
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,590
longer seem a large enterprise actually
Yukon

38
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,530
try to detect them yep by physical
inspection because if you're

39
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,120
my thousands clients yukon gold reverie
Maschine take on

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,349
so you need actually a software which
you can roll out

41
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:47,010
and try to contact them basically

42
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,370
what are hot where he orders them let me
start with them

43
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,590
shorts explanation basically

44
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,000
alright longer sorry available for use
%um keyboard excuse to

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
keyboards move buddy yeah

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,470
stuff like that rejection clock in
between

47
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,209
PC and more and they are also available
s

48
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,319
million PCIe cards 4s your

49
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,280
molecules which are beyond you choose
more and you can buy a

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,090
ready to install your which you trust
like him and it has been modified

51
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,379
record he strolls however today we're
going to talk about peace to base once

52
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,950
and use the base once

53
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,250
and yeah so watches

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,629
device actually do they tried to wreck
or

55
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,799
all stock you've typed into your
physical keyboard

56
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,939
and dimples can later on you retrieve

57
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,250
by yes backup I'm the capture Badar

58
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,349
can actually you retrieve yes software
for some products

59
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,250
the normal wage retrieve them is you
have fewer

60
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,680
humour you typed in a season pass for
and the Q or

61
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,299
acts s ghost keyboards and sense the
read for those keystrokes

62
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,439
actually PC and you can capture them
knows at work

63
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,510
whatsoever or of the youth and have your
password

64
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,510
the device shows off ass flash drive
there are also some balls which tried to

65
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,030
transfer data

66
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,340
your own efforts like wifi which

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,390
am cue over Los im to a wifi

68
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,230
and of the words he can send menu or you
can do it she simply connect to keel

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,780
over

70
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,890
naw to retrieve the he strolls or you
can retrieve them

71
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,630
which you and that's basically what are
a few of us can do what they are capable

72
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,300
of

73
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,310
today a half-life out to choose got my
flash memory

74
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,200
the are password-protected man who reads

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,770
imprints on is to retrieve the hardware
you won't be able to get ready for that

76
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,610
stuff without the correct password

77
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,140
they have time stamping functions where
they actually time spent huge

78
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,390
Press based on that time steps you can
create

79
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,600
Pardew's charts a.m. you have like
search functions

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,780
research memory of the key longer for
someone else to

81
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,970
room where in which you actually can
upgrades yes software

82
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,180
ants yes oh yes it does devices have a
lot of futures

83
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,610
bearer yes small device which much
technology

84
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,300
are that expensive for ps2 with a star

85
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,520
32 US dollars and for use you once you
can stop

86
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,590
on 58 you ask followup yam

87
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,460
that's that's basically so let's have a
look at the company's

88
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,320
you have basically to be companies which

89
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,440
previews long as you have she mm which

90
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,090
actually smallness you walk and who are
three different names

91
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,370
and Europe ki Karda ants

92
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,710
actually most of the models you can get
life he called rocky llama

93
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,160
on stock it's all there in a while
basically stay with friends

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,350
beam that you have although

95
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,680
products which are also quite famous in
the wild

96
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,580
line keep cash on heroes shower

97
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,810
and then you have some other piece of
tech stuff like from charging out there

98
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,650
are some models

99
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,560
of they are you have seen your of them
archer actually guessed by

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,830
then you have like 30 source loggers

101
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,540
bands then you have like in wireless
longer from UK

102
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,230
and yeah that's basically longer market
that moment

103
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,760
ones which are green are the ones I
taking a look at

104
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,900
I'm the reason I look at yes

105
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,920
simply I didn't manage to get the
software

106
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,720
sees defender wasn't able to send it to
me since through Mon

107
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,300
however I got last week so for you
future there will be enough they

108
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,880
the most cubans

109
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,090
so before we actually start I would like
to chew

110
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,730
start off with peace to you and explain
to you how it works so we can try to

111
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,600
detect hardware keyloggers

112
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,860
threes my school computer peace to you
and will stop with the

113
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,820
is you still in use for example in that
notebook it's a

114
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,070
you the past two months old and you
actually the keyboard

115
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,640
in the computer at the building one
picture is connected yep he's too busy

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,670
piece to base work so is still in use

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,180
okay keyboard basically consists of a
why I'm of trace

118
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,180
and a microcontroller once you press E

119
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,790
microcontroller stance scantrons

120
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,730
the which is divided into many croat and
they break own

121
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,660
2pc once you hold down the key and make
coats and repeatedly GPC

122
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,420
wants to release a a break from San on a
PC have thought you have today

123
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,830
boris controller which is also relief at
US

124
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,140
ABC and can be accessed on a PC and saw
it

125
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,580
yeah for sixty you or not to retrieve
the press

126
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,060
he strolls import 64 which is a stop
sport

127
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,720
so the communication between those two
components

128
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,580
you know things stempel's she wore needs
to send

129
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,880
scan cones to PC but there are some

130
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,490
yeah communications that are that all
just first look

131
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,400
for example the KTC camping the humour

132
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,580
is cam tell me she worked for myself

133
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,849
past became sets the repeated raids

134
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,339
yet scam do all kinds of stuff and

135
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:41,139
for example in traffic said LED's if you
press for example should

136
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:45,000
for non law monarchy more that's my top
the only you fact

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,509
just since the scandal to the PC PCB
sites left turn on

138
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,300
or of the LED and sense back to come on
to keep forces

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,410
basically how they communicate

140
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,680
index of you have for its up lottie team

141
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,079
so the case he sends come on

142
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,680
you which stands for P to the keyboard
energy for

143
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,879
response with you that's basically an
example how AP

144
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,759
for its so

145
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,089
another slice about ps2 I'm pretty sure
all of you know

146
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,230
connector interesting are basically Chu

147
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,790
parts of it softened law him which are
used to transfer today

148
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,939
communications 5 directional ants

149
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:35,009
gives you more actually defines the law
trade which can be between thirty

150
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,300
and 59 seconds the data

151
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,149
that I transferred of data frames sense
the keyboard sense

152
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,730
11 state of rights with a star bids

153
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,100
aids daughter beats which actually re
present babe

154
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,959
sounds like this can tell parity bit
stop it

155
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,319
it's basically the same for the KTC
except that you haven't

156
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:01,769
smallish bid which is sound bites your
once retrieved

157
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,949
Mon so here you can see how actually
looks like

158
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:10,209
yeah lock and you have to data transfers

159
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,540
winds cool to know 0 wens goods

160
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,569
-1 so quite simple

161
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,509
am before you actually tried to detect

162
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:24,660
that kind of stuff first thing I cannot
with Vince

163
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,660
current measurements since we haven't
additional component the Q over

164
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,800
that's fine %um your current distraught
sees that hardware

165
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,249
needs more card and you can measure best
on the wire

166
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:39,399
actually for he even its like 65

167
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,889
million yours four key capturer it's
like 54 million

168
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:46,339
yes and yeah its

169
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,810
can't measures however in software you
have like no

170
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,720
possibility you measuring since the
mother what simply has no sense or

171
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,730
source software you can get them

172
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,749
she's %oh that doesn't for

173
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:04,519
I'm excited I came up with this
daughters of hot rap protect of ass for

174
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,600
protected at the password like an ashy
typically Santa your support

175
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,259
of the worst she keylogger

176
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,699
reacts like a goes York and starts to
sag

177
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:19,939
record keystrokes so

178
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:23,279
the nice thing about the fact this most
models are shipped with

179
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,120
default passwords which probably are
change some vendors

180
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,470
even recommend not to change them in
their instruction

181
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,639
because once you've changed you
constantly receptors

182
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,100
you have to send back Mon to the vendor
and she has to reset password for you so

183
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,810
it's

184
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,139
quite complex to do so I judge him up
with is

185
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,370
if we could 14 step pastor yes software

186
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,060
and checked for the ghost I B we
actually captured detect them

187
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,430
but first problem I came up with this
them

188
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,699
the test topic you want just don't act
debate online passively

189
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:02,819
is that they are placed in mind

190
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:07,230
you concede right here you have to keep
more and yet the PC and a hot mess

191
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,680
you over that's placed invite actually
am

192
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,360
impulse that's the hope communications
is Michael process

193
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,870
something's which take data from more
some

194
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,209
going through PC so Israel your site's
inside

195
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:24,660
lime the problem is the how much longer

196
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,990
notes how the data flows knows

197
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,279
the data actually comes from the
keyboard am

198
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,889
on yes I'm just common sense simply face
he strolls

199
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,019
hopper's long the night thing about this
however is

200
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,579
stocky work Mon switch you consent yet
for sixty reads

201
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:48,189
to fake he presses which am I guess
probably think you're

202
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:51,249
response which is in for free which
looks like a

203
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:55,990
its and he has been pressed like this
can't go and see the French so

204
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,749
you actually can create a translation
table

205
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:02,800
in which you write down which more Kamau
least

206
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,980
rich fate keypress and then basically
can't perform a brute force attack

207
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,309
yet software with that lookup table

208
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:16,019
the only problem is it doesn't that
practical because you only have like 10

209
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:16,870
chars

210
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,230
which you can unite that way and so

211
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,399
Yukon in force all passwords just cant
force

212
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,829
some password combinations and it
doesn't work for all models adjustments

213
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:28,600
for key goes

214
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,980
once and some key cash models

215
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,629
however is does look nice and I was like
to show you a short that'll

216
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:39,829
demonstrating that basically the first

217
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:44,100
thought you will see how it looks like
when Nokia overstressed

218
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,240
and I start my program to group forced
to kill over

219
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,749
s were off towards I start of May

220
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:53,790
ands yeah we should see not been since
there's no

221
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,269
you over Press

222
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,529
you can see in my view over crust

223
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:07,509
I actually saw the program shouldn't
force stop nominal

224
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:11,430
nothing happens now if we do decide but
we'll take you longer present

225
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,519
you over should be on law and she senses

226
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,529
yeah goes hyphens 29

227
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:26,529
you consider lovers present

228
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,210
we start of program stuff on and its

229
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,430
start sending space strokes that's on
you

230
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,090
you say he goes okay

231
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,560
of that solution timber very good
foreign

232
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,470
yeah all environments so I had to find
another solution

233
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,180
and I thought whens they are placed in
line

234
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,600
they might change the data that is
actually transferred on

235
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,360
data line you might have different
signal switch should be measured on the

236
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,150
PC

237
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,480
for example if you send a certain more
mom response might be different

238
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,010
there might be a own clock signal of the
hardware keylogger

239
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,330
there might be a dislocation between the
clock and

240
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,440
of a signal which is different than it
is for only two keyboards

241
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,100
long maybe we can see more so what I
actually

242
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,410
business I used a logic analyzer to you

243
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,600
tap data directly at more asked you to

244
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,140
they up of that has actually pasta
hardware cue over

245
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,340
snow I'm able to see how they handle
slide when

246
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,360
reach the more and how it looks like

247
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,650
once it has passed yeah I'm holler

248
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,300
you over solo that's how the results
look like you can see we have

249
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,010
more beta we have took you long enough

250
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,630
law mere data yet and that sa good looks

251
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:01,630
yet five Simulia if we take a closer
look at it then we can actually

252
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,540
identified

253
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,890
in that example once the yours

254
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,320
pools the clock slow thank you all for

255
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,260
calls watch little their sex life delay
between those two

256
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,390
once the clock school began back to high

257
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,480
reaction to conceive that sample it's
doesn't always look like that on that

258
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,130
sample

259
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,790
they are pulled high at the same time so

260
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,010
what we basically can see your is that
clock cycles are actually short for the

261
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,790
hard work you over

262
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,340
probably yeah because the holler long it
simply generates its own

263
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,570
least glossy now on though problems
you're a sit-down we can detect on livor

264
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,180
bath their small possibility to
detective your software

265
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,190
40k see you have some from Monsey

266
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,330
or let you identified state of the plot
line with its high or low

267
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,920
about the problems Yukon get such
accurate measurement likely wouldn't

268
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,350
during a data transfer to measure how
long clock cycles

269
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,650
actually are back what you see in this

270
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,320
but lost signal started later what's

271
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,810
old major too low and yes so

272
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,040
the hardware lover might cause a delay
on the wire

273
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,060
and it's quite simple since they are
place

274
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,580
in line and multiprocessor has to you
and I lost signal

275
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,170
and yes the righteous memory yes
possible on

276
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,140
it's an additional logic and this
additional logic just increased signal

277
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,060
propagation

278
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm index of here you can see yeah I'm

279
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,320
already had a test email begins megan's

280
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,760
dislocations like wats for the clock and
we can see when the

281
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,440
AC Milan splendid complete transference

282
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,090
Don a at we can see their supply

283
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,300
dislocation Windows you you are the key
parts of

284
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,399
stopped early on longer needs more time
that's basically a

285
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,300
delay that's the truth used right here
so

286
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,430
the idea I came up with this and we
could simply send a

287
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,200
Tremont to be she bore fighters York
comptroller

288
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,920
we wait for a response

289
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,180
of a few more astute outcome of and we
actually measured the runtime for this

290
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,150
it's basically like a team you know from
networking

291
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:33,630
and reproduce 8484 so I just wrote the
small

292
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,950
sounds like to love which basically
sense the

293
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,960
identified more commodities just one for
my life

294
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,630
chosen you can also use the more
whatsoever is

295
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,670
at you I write about yup or CC

296
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,950
to you humour and send it to you

297
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,020
more that's basically just checking when
time allows to

298
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,220
like they have never for and them

299
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,600
that I don't straighten right here just
wait onto you

300
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,260
more response with and June which
actually step

301
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,480
a on porous 6 and

302
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,940
does hold stock sending ma waiting for
response I'm

303
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,770
like my hundreds their life yeah
£10valentine's

304
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,230
I'm doing that stuff here and school

305
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,580
we can measure how long actually takes
buffet

306
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,050
you over as president activity he warns

307
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,080
present I'm the problems

308
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
the late reviews 5 longer is very small
them

309
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,160
some people already have mansion the
staten before it might be possible

310
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,460
during sometime around and stuff not
them

311
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,940
to count const Mike shown to ew.com used
and use other than

312
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,180
and yours you love you drops and you
need quite inaccurate I miss you man

313
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,320
soon do you use the lawn stuff simply

314
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,360
isn't enough you really have to get the
most accurate measurement you can get

315
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,170
you have to

316
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:07,150
get the CPU and stuff excuses you and
just run your column

317
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,210
were that you get the her affect most at
risk time

318
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,680
so when I actually desirable to you
later

319
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,580
current module I tried to get the CPU

320
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,220
exclusively body deactivating interrupts
what a process or

321
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,380
like this even colonel preemption by

322
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,710
unit getting to be current lockridge by
where you

323
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,500
shouldn't you and then run my chest and
my phones

324
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,190
and measure times actually needs to run
I'm

325
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,820
the problem is when measuring how long
it actually takes

326
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,790
runs since we just a interrupts we don't
get correct timing and more

327
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,830
stand-alone I just came up with the idea
of

328
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,730
taking the princess first time stamp
counter and counting the years

329
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:00,290
CPU cycles actually in order to
determine how long might hold runs

330
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,530
does this value not for us and we don't
need a

331
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,440
real time we have my how many plot signs

332
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,560
run but no longer spread and how many
what sites

333
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,820
needs to run 16 dealers present so
friends you would like to you

334
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,600
reach out to make time needs based on
your CPU speed and stuff

335
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,340
yeah after measuring the time basically
i restore the normal operating system

336
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,070
state

337
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,170
and life on stuff back to the crew
message buffer

338
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,890
so I can get it from use the Lanza
analyzes

339
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,650
and these are basically my results you
can see you know it's true

340
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,000
more distressing mid-life that tell you
that number of

341
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
lost cycles and forms through you of
course we get themselves in

342
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,700
but you can see you Redbox which
highlighted

343
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm values are be up once

344
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,260
who oversaw present so we can actions
years

345
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,850
and what we can do now this we can
simply create

346
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,410
a baseline we do any measurement once
more lovers present

347
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,100
for our for KTC again for all of the
works since that's all in but

348
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,010
independent depends on your keys you
Mortenson individual value

349
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,110
and said you define it right baseline
been alright Fountain of Life 3381

350
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,580
you for q4 so we could say our baseline
slight

351
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,960
338 you and

352
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,720
that are certain time we can't do the
measurement yeah I'm

353
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,200
ands if it's your 338 you

354
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,310
actual over probably is present if its
lower

355
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,080
no kilometers from and so me actually
champion fact

356
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,050
his two best comic you longer sinéad
generic way

357
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,730
once the fact that we might like to the
few them by

358
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,320
AV software doctors on other malware

359
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,290
and the first lady I came up with this
week to try for a few weeks longer

360
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,980
memory

361
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,240
yeah software I'm issue

362
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,280
you know the complete memory of a few
over its

363
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,060
behavior depends on the model some
models just start walking

364
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,080
when the end of the memories reach some
starch moonlights at the beginning to

365
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,310
gather

366
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,420
but in any way we can stop the keel over
from Ogden

367
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,930
or we can overwrite memory so the
records keystrokes are

368
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,600
yet destroyed in any way yourself from
logging so

369
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,810
like an Ashes their sake work Mon switch
reach you

370
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,170
a key presses actually and if you sense
does

371
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,850
for months repeatedly you over for sure
will

372
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,100
middle of them small pressed keys

373
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,560
and saw a lot of a small co to do so and

374
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,720
I was able to you sorry

375
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,510
and to lock my 100 she's in 10 seconds

376
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,710
means I can create time of he's in one
second

377
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,720
this means you need like 109 minutes to

378
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,400
throughout 64k bytes of memory

379
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,540
and yet that solution isn't bad you

380
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,620
slap thought maybe we can use the York
come on

381
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,670
FB which actually stick Monfort resend

382
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,070
just untested he works resent the last
cent blinds

383
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,590
and Dustin slower you can see here is
just reviewed for lockheed's

384
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,230
ten-second some but not murder you know

385
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,940
and stress yeah is a practical I'm I'm
say

386
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,200
no most models is to raise one since

387
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,550
peace tubulars on developed that much
anymore

388
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,880
they don't have night you don't like it
memory only use the monster

389
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,270
most system half-life if UK fides room

390
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,560
a few megabytes or you basically should
feel %uh all the memory with you might

391
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,620
wanna holler about

392
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,010
know what he really wants rage one hour
before you actually start

393
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,490
use computer soul yeah numbers

394
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,670
doesn't work the next five years from

395
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,960
it would be even better if we could stop
the Q what we're actually

396
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,570
from armed keystrokes and

397
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,560
since I mention the keyboard cents 10
comments once you press a key

398
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,850
and shuttles make calls if you fall down
yeah ray combs once you really sticky

399
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,020
and there find a nice temples

400
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,050
that you have line Res and holds one to

401
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,500
3 tour is the one that's normally use
them

402
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,790
for all seasons basically month you can
say

403
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,280
and the nice thing about that is the

404
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,750
computer can actually arcades you can
actually tell if he were

405
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,730
which I'm scheduled Sat it should use

406
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,240
you have a key for Kaman f0 and

407
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,190
the night thing about this all tested
loggers just supports

408
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,190
and conceptual in three but actually
means if you switch back to scandals and

409
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,990
one

410
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,020
you won't be able to yeah law

411
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,010
and you she strolls anymore and yet you
can feel it

412
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,780
that way so when I'm yeah you just have
to tell me wash

413
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,210
switchback stempel's one than for you
operating system

414
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,110
you have to create a new mapping of his
temperament code since

415
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,120
my system would recognize many more

416
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,570
but for realz you have bills Komatsu on
board and stop buttons

417
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,870
small problem to be fine use chemicals
up

418
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,110
yeah that's basically for peace through
let's have a look at issues

419
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,860
the for his yeah I also would like with
a short introduction life for a piece to

420
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,370
house basically for us

421
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,540
so we can get a better impression and
see how to detect

422
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,740
for use we have like a host controller

423
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,960
basically and on guest host country love
you have

424
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,720
are third novel ups and on the end of
this house we have to buy

425
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,930
so we basically credit restructuring
news

426
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,220
the used bikes in Rittenhouse nerves

427
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,270
and points at point basically sliding
input or output

428
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,660
offer you can simply say and each device
at the end point zero

429
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,670
which is Matt point that's used for
configuration

430
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,530
to configure device to retrieve its
configurations

431
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,410
up and for low-speed USB devices

432
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,660
like the humour yes US at point zero for
the conflagration

433
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,390
and Jeff Chiu and points with age lines

434
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,160
for use transfers only do you host
controller managers

435
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,690
the communication with the advice
devices

436
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,080
don't sense come ons are already packed
themselves

437
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,890
only you host controller Paul's the
devices

438
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,400
and pastas and the conflagration Bay
sent

439
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,230
their stuff back so the whole
communications controlled by the host

440
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,200
controller

441
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,930
if a device like a he works needs to you

442
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,050
send key presses really great and beat
st. finance

443
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,180
device configuration all once before
them

444
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,730
up just has to choose the value to its
flight no so no key press reviews

445
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,070
and data for use yeah transfer
speculates

446
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,430
and yes life or transfer types yeah is
pools transfer

447
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,800
interrupt transfer %uh transfer and
control transfer

448
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,480
interesting for us are just to in brown
transfers

449
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,830
which I used to yes and a small amount
of data like this case when you have a

450
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,000
few more

451
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,520
ans retransmission for those contracts
first

452
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,900
works by use the up to three times arrow

453
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,100
first and then we have to control
transfers to set the device

454
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,080
configuration stock

455
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,970
dance the night thing about this control
transfers of technology in both

456
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,470
directions like

457
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,470
she's that you have to use

458
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,340
different device classes sandwich
finalize the reason why you can't like

459
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,880
you may use these the poor

460
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,430
your or miles and it works without
installing any

461
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,860
kind of drives I'm interesting process
the human interface device class

462
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,360
that actually defines communication
between

463
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,730
keyboards anti-eu chase

464
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,170
or sorry Union okays for use the between
you host controller

465
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,980
PC and its actually the keyboard can
send

466
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,040
eight flights input records once

467
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,820
them bought by the house which %uh
Sandusky for %uh transfers

468
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,600
and the packet Facebook life like that
850 wildfire

469
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,920
use we can use and Jeff seats

470
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,700
he calls that are sent which by mystery
might just impressed

471
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,580
sixties on a USB keyboard signals from
you sleep

472
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,650
and its yeah know may cause we have no

473
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,680
Rachael's you just have to keep
goldman's he's pressed once it is

474
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,440
released

475
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,790
is just year old

476
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,380
as on a PC discounts and

477
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,510
15 of the draft worst work which us and
that's used to control transfers

478
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,150
and I basically just use to control
state of the LED's

479
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,200
X look like mister like one who non law

480
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,520
one for caps lock and so on on

481
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,170
just know additional key work moms like
we have for peace to you

482
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,180
all the kind of stuff like tight magic
rate and so on this

483
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,230
defined on a PC the PC has to diplomats

484
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,510
its I left in stock anti transfer life

485
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,430
lol current stops matched by use so you
basically just that

486
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,620
those two con packets which are used to
you

487
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,030
for communication between the keyboard
anti

488
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,600
PC so the first yeah I cannot like

489
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,250
for use for peace to you current
measurement

490
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,310
if you look in the device manager of
four years you actually see you know man

491
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,450
compare slim device falls about them

492
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,330
that's isn't actually devalued also it's
just a

493
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,350
values sans device configuration

494
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,030
its does not represent how much currents
really drawings

495
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,440
just a valued at $75 integration and you

496
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,340
don't have any sense worse for you
speech you more investment firm in how

497
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,220
much current

498
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,840
really strong so that often doesn't like
it did for

499
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,420
history so the next I came up with

500
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,170
principal yes passwords I'm

501
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,860
for carbon there are some software out
there in water to retrieve his troubles

502
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,980
which is called

503
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,659
threatens almost there Tretton reform
yes

504
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,740
issues like the software that resulted
he strolls

505
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,010
probably I'm able to read out the
keystrokes to by software

506
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,710
so yeah I took a risk the lives of which
is a

507
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,470
software-based use the protocol analyzer
and most how

508
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,070
program actually communicates with the
hardware and

509
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,840
yet us that well I'm using out correct
port switch

510
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,390
if you remember RRR to set the LED state
so

511
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:07,159
once you think that's will all the lude
links leave often quite a funny way

512
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,250
am but yeah basically it's just
communicates by sending those

513
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,860
15 all records which you can see your
control transfer

514
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,990
that sounds for 53 and so on

515
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,750
as you take a closer look at them you
will see that there say

516
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,700
instead are at the beginning there's
there is some control transfers that

517
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,450
control values which if I'm like you had
a just the same life

518
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,690
a folder and password which is used to

519
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,000
not the keylogger am

520
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,100
sense choose between the future and that
matter

521
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,300
anti password actually every chart new
password is encoded with

522
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,490
for control transfers with me which
means like four bytes

523
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,650
but if you reverse engineer to haul
stuff you can create a

524
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,310
lookup table we have to fix better we
have to put her

525
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:02,270
we can trade and got a before every char
and we can try to perform a brute force

526
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,260
attack yesil

527
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,530
where and that actually works too

528
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,450
tu brute force that model about is just
works for key carbon since that's the

529
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:11,870
only

530
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:17,280
you over which provides a software to
retrieve the keystrokes

531
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,419
so another high savings for use the

532
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:24,990
MIT changes to use the properties or use
people which

533
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,200
that's how it looks like if I plug in
just like yours

534
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,310
yeah my of we have to poor sport
lockport you

535
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,540
planned on port 21 reply my more

536
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,120
we plug in a you offer and exxon

537
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,600
are looks like that museum

538
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,760
basically what bass is introduce

539
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,220
18:04 or hot we have port 1 I'm you

540
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,110
for or so just flaxen not a hot and
import while

541
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,130
that up B-plus in March more

542
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,820
so yeah its and you use the outfits

543
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,050
be introduced to or use the topology
bassam

544
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,230
thats no problem and she cartons

545
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,919
ass like the device undetectable in
practice

546
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,900
by software the device shows up in
Windows Device Manager I S H in every

547
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,940
use yup this generic you see how has no
I streets

548
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,050
and this distinguishable from the
generic USB hub

549
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,380
on ninety percent of all use the house
I'm

550
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,750
it's quite interesting to say we are
undetectable

551
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,450
am yeah we introduce a hot but anyway
here undetectable because we we have no

552
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,020
strings that are associated to us though

553
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,440
yeah interesting but anyway incorrect
because

554
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,600
if you look at the botched this group or

555
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,360
you can see vendor id: which actually is

556
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,899
0451 which is for texas instruments

557
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:55,610
and we have a product id: which is 2046

558
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,440
and yeah that's facing a texas
instruments used to help control the

559
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,000
whole

560
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,010
to use 20 46 the

561
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,320
and guess what if you open the advice
and take a look at it you will find

562
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,010
exactly

563
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,470
that compound on the hardware so what's

564
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,670
and use the top comes up in two words:
apology with

565
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,520
that life through the door should take a
close look at it

566
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,750
the next thing is for she goes another
offer

567
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,250
longer changes still device property
simply

568
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,880
you can see normally %eh more if on the
mic you're slackin

569
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,290
it estimates the device properties:
packets I saw

570
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,930
a rich in refers to a long speed
boss-like he worked his

571
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:46,150
ants if you block him seagulls it
actually becomes a force the device with

572
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,450
a

573
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,510
excites 64

574
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,670
for Kamal the five states for only if
your spot %um

575
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,940
its essence pasquale or if the value is
0 which is

576
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,170
records of power about if you plug in
CEO's

577
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,290
between the keyboard and PC it actually
says

578
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,610
the values oneness cell holler

579
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,870
why all that stuff looks like this you
will see on I'm

580
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,890
later slice am

581
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,960
I was really a a.m.

582
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,040
high pressure meds we headed for peace
to you

583
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,600
we can use it for you speech you again I
miss my logic analyzer

584
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,580
you can guess you have humour all
transfers data

585
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,850
humour once a few overs present how it
looks like

586
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,030
you can see me introduced small name
large your

587
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,060
and of course we can measure it the only
thing we have to do this we have true

588
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,960
or all of his to stop to use the

589
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,090
I'm same idea

590
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,900
we just for about Sam dhahran ok you're

591
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,100
months we actually can send like we have
for peace to

592
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,460
but if you remember PC consent 15 up
draft boards to keep working order to

593
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,800
set the LED's

594
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,890
and the nice thing about that is they're
actually send us control transfers

595
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,640
and like a national control transfers
are acknowledge

596
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,040
so we actually have a channel which we
can use like you

597
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,240
we set the we wait for the acknowledge
and

598
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,580
yeah we heard you the first time
measurement again

599
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,370
salt lime cementation simply sent from
all route 422

600
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,960
more wakes onto the socks that's that
there is time

601
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,330
%uh te sol five flight we did for peace
to you

602
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,680
and I measured the runtime cool thing
about that is

603
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,020
we actually don't have to go to colonel
at I'm

604
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,140
which I'm quite happy about because I
guess nobody would like to you

605
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,290
only use the stock kernel and and it's
been

606
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,640
prim pretty much yet for peace to you

607
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,280
and so we can say you were land and we
can use libraries like refused to do so

608
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,590
and these are my results for use the
base

609
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,060
measure on a you can see a text that
I'll

610
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,910
milliseconds sports present and for q1
first place

611
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:06,350
that time so you can actually see yes

612
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,670
needs more time to cameras

613
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,800
on so by his bid same me crazy

614
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,050
baseline for a default setup in which we
have to consider our house

615
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,660
and stuff we have in our you sleep
apology because if you will

616
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,720
later on locking you up on your keyboard
forced about would increase pretty much

617
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,830
and she wants get false positives so

618
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,860
yeah to graze a baseline for you

619
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,870
default setup then you can't measure
again

620
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:41,640
yeah can detect levay they are present
or not

621
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,030
the next thing on the spotlight Ross
isn't different

622
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,530
work behavior am

623
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,110
moral behavior for my keyboard is a
funny way improperly

624
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,480
I get like that they have and I send and
use the reset

625
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,530
to device and its performs in reset

626
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,730
and I did you find the route from damn
to get

627
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,580
data from yours everything's not because
it has been accepted and

628
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,110
everything's time you we love him

629
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:13,230
the key goals you over you read

630
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,810
data we get exactly the same day and got

631
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,480
you that the sand and use you reset

632
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,220
region in for a treat again

633
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,370
and we actually get the same day like
got here

634
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,090
which dislikes strange because not only
should be not so

635
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,290
maybe you more memories use

636
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,200
user so again I use my logic analyzer

637
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,410
and during a use your is that you have

638
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:47,960
2.0 waters lost mines and during a news
here is that both of them too little

639
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,600
for a certain amount of time as you can
see barbecue over the PC

640
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,950
sense use your set it's cool to know

641
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,480
but of the you over yes no use the
receptor century keyboard

642
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,630
so I'm yeah reason wide

643
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,580
interrupt really busy not just simply
because export never see

644
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,990
used here is that and

645
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,030
that's also the reason for the
difference a

646
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:18,050
device settings I showed you on the
early a slice

647
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,810
I'm we actually have on to

648
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:26,750
all all a kiosk on the heels

649
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,750
may actually have them use signature

650
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,270
host and device controller which is ISPE
11 6181

651
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,600
be ans that one x's a

652
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,870
device for the PC and that's the reason
why we have a different device

653
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,050
configuration

654
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,220
with that merits s itself onward say

655
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,320
high-speed device and so on and

656
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,640
to keel over X is a fool's control up
for doing humour

657
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,840
side so yeah we can detect that you

658
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,500
basically weak and useless use you again
to you emperor of treats sent to use

659
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,070
your 7 stuff

660
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,970
and detect that way and weekends I
measurement and then lunch room

661
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,180
each of them issues and use the reset

662
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:15,260
the tide takes until device
configuration again

663
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,470
is your reticence much forgot vicki
lawrence present because it sets a

664
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,600
heist device and doesn't pasta use

665
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,350
use that to you you foresee basically
another device that's

666
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:31,120
yet false the room getting to use your 7
coming up again

667
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:37,310
stuff so you can't can detect using
punishments you

668
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,780
so my conclusion it's time for

669
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,860
ps2 you can say all model so I got

670
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,150
inch my iPad

671
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:52,350
Union walking by placing their
microcontroller feelin

672
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:56,630
and not tapping the bottom line
absolutely and possibly using time

673
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,760
measurement techniques

674
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,140
I from detect all piece to raise of
murky waters

675
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,190
in order to defeat them I troops which
stempel's

676
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,540
1 for all of them

677
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,120
former USB you can basically detected

678
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,560
yeah differences in values yep you see
use the topology star

679
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,930
you see device configuration interrupts

680
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,430
up and basically date they introduce
changes to it

681
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:28,030
use the seven seas much more complicated
to

682
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:33,330
implemented there nobody wins uses all
microcontroller stuff basically all

683
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,880
people buy Euros

684
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,430
yeah ready to install components like
him

685
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,080
yeah bitch which implement all use the
stuff so their of differences

686
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,320
am which you can detect then there are
individual box like to see

687
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,400
for the software ever actually bought
for students

688
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,100
and yeah actually I'm dream much
research on US

689
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,590
yeah I haven't finished it that's just
me short insure that out introduction to

690
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,620
topic I'm

691
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:07,000
much more like a national I just got the
and months of

692
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,880
she law and yeah

693
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,410
so my general conclusions all test hot
make you must contain actually box to

694
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,440
detect some just one

695
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,380
some more box and if you can't find them
if you look at everything over alone

696
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,020
you look like 2003 techniques to detect
this you can create like it after

697
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,740
like you can dream the softener like him
signature and you can even say okay

698
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,060
that you over is president busty Pam

699
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,460
detect them the whole stuff I already

700
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,060
told you today reliever Santana am

701
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,230
I've written a proof-of-concept code
which I love notes into

702
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,290
will prozac already has register

703
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,720
once I find time the next week month

704
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,560
no clue am and on uploaded and you can
have a look at it

705
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,520
play around your cell I'm see method
works for you want

706
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,140
environment so that's it

707
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,360
thank you very much for your entrust and

708
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,980
you anybody has and more questions

709
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,340
you free loss please

710
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:21,450
usual and says Julia up

711
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,930
yeah down yeah I yet 100 I'm

712
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,170
I was just us done what's about
notebooks if you say like

713
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,190
yeah notebooks we have no external
keyboard mister

714
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,000
from Chi Minh offers lovers I'm the
facts yes

715
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,950
I'm a national you don't have just the

716
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,670
senator ps3 warmer use deeper matters

717
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,860
you can also get life yeah Michael
controls or small stuff

718
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,630
which you just 10 potentially more you
can open the your

719
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,680
you can so lawrence on their place

720
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,020
your back and you're done there are
already am

721
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,040
works which you can buy for laptops tomb

722
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,120
with that's kind of to already
integrates

723
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,910
you just have to change the them yeah
laptop keyboards and you're done

724
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,720
yeah that's that's a problem for leftist
true

725
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,910
the nation s possible for

726
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:21,900
animation the electromagnetic version

727
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,660
measure that okie dokie not physically
said

728
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,750
no his

729
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,170
for I for but those okay

730
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,320
yeah I'm yeah I'm I was asked them
whether they are

731
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,560
lovers available that actually measure
the

732
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,250
electromagnetic signals that are yet
once once the signals are transferred

733
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,010
and you have to them

734
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:49,080
on the wire to GTECH I'm basically no

735
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,990
I just stumbled across a guy who's
written about that kinda stuff you're

736
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:53,700
mentioning

737
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,920
I'm to your Etsy early you wrote it will
be possible

738
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,230
apparently there's no hot euro huge top

739
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,650
instructing radical us its probably was

740
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,750
because yeah

741
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,970
yeah he's para

742
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,260
order for in back

743
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,320
yeah better realized

744
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,500
fire and yeah

745
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,520
the question wall of them since

746
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,520
I said all devices are placed in line
whether you vendors

747
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,290
or people already tried to beyond models
which known to intercept the

748
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,090
communications

749
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,570
active to passively I'm

750
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:44,120
yes and no I'm there are some

751
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,500
open source or solve their like an ashen
and

752
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,570
those people are where of that fact

753
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:54,740
and through what's are out there
actually show with them

754
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:58,870
3 passively I'm the better since I have

755
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:02,080
talked to you true I'm I'm

756
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,640
day don't see that much as problem and I
guess the

757
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,890
they will change it anymore because
piece to basically

758
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,530
will will run out gets deprecated at
some point

759
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:16,460
and I guess they will focus more on use
the ones were just 30

760
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,020
keep the peace three like it is now I'm
in a few years nobody would care anymore

761
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,990
but basically Dara last all their for
mostly because at the end you can solve

762
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,710
them yourself

763
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,160
probably fine

764
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,460
any more questions

765
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,740
no okay so thank you very much for your
trust

766
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,300
well
