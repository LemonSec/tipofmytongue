don't expect to use latter and she to
you

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,220
download smaller around with it and
analyze the day

32

about K I'm all his remember K

38
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,209
Bible here we won't get attack and where

39
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,219
we get attack month when I like that and
not

40
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:33,310
on try a few for

41
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,659
say a our environment again

42
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,670
as already gurl boss

43
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,819
no you how to prepared by you

44
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,090
rules so you not to eating patterns to
be

45
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,109
tech what yes attack all too well

46
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:53,069
up for basic structure

47
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,120
blackness so yeah you will hear you love
them

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,419

we are the last summer which is a
holiday for a few

51
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,150
you measure then yeah pattern matching
HRM

52
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,379
which looking for ways happening right
now with attacks

53
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,799
a.m. are there what's hot pakora

54
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,889
and we have molecule over we can
leverage

55
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:27,239
different monks you see me AAO

56
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,859
I Megumi with the offerings by and

57
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,609
K anyhow although he did you find
patterns

58
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:38,180
and operation all national to make re

59
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,199
you made saw

60
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,599
these molecules all our won't do not

61
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,699
yeah action on your actually

62
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,680
all day how you react only and axle for
example

63
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,719
every three mo funny your day example of
a planned

64
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,939
somebody try to read your local easy

65
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,919
after you can act them you have how
national %um

66
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,079
that sense back any happy

67
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,620
file free attack partly where you see a
sample but didn't just whether then

68
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,370
and national you and you only or one
action you

69
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,709

every Avery Park love you all

72
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,699
report reveals that he whatever I'll a
of molecules

73
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,379
I for you really an assault you

74
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,680
I'll for him communique yeah database
last

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,069
writing locks on doing for AIX is
communicating we have

76
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,810
sample cases surrounded where and

77
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,180
was all there Press poll you

78
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,300
Ground tracking or so he got him on
prozac

79
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,699
'em the whole thing is written in Java

operations offers on Tremont

98
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,689
home what you will can report attacks a

99
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,789
to treasure hey you get

100
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,229

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,080
ever that day use are you all get this
information

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,699
I reform that allege or encumber

116
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,280
those make re yeah

117
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,650
firms are also very for but you see
there is

118
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,509
yeah question I so you're meal a day
fired you know

119
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,800
way and mash to Judy an attack

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,490
and yeah happens Nolan finest regular
expression

121
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,330
as a half I for example RAM pressure
again simple example

122
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,240
somebody tries usual I'm using

123
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,659
he after you learn how to rule name

124
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,689
only heralded you have you you

125
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:52,960
tax so that you can classify Afghan
National Army and

126
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,060
brother really whatever and a half also

127
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,509
use the Athenian well you also for a
time when want to use their districts

128
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,749
and a.m. you know about of know that you
asked the same

129
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:08,210
not you matching that Pastor you how a
low-income

130
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,490
Rangers this is less than 10 and how

131
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,080
while you learn specific me a if I fall
for

132
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,639
1rr said you were free patterns of
racial going to ask for injection you

133
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,770
about you when you the are you reacts
I'm

134
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,360
out there which bf rejection re-up

135
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,529
proud of you really how assisting in
runs Ulm

136
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:34,409
virtual machine and is hosting database
for example

137
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,190
so we had to react with an actor happy
with our really at all information

138
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,540
I'll system and of course at me back
well

139
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,200
is a big problem a lot you Sat solves
all so far

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,350
that at the bar across so for example is
a

141
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,890
at the overall impact is higher than the
30-day

142
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,510
I want to be out and you may have an
administrator of the holiday or whatever

143
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,970
this may track you also how things all

144
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,340
money for a solution

145
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,850
and yeah her ass I asked this question
yes

146
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,060
this would be for I Russia yes

147
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,740
anyway saw Hall this enable contact

148
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,130
I'll moment we're you know among others

149
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,300
all the dynamic torch generator New York

150
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,420
generator household you know already
burning or

151
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,540
nor or whatever always as a pattern

152
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,880
have source for research I S and
attacker

153
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,750
do exactly that state right I search
engine

154
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,840
for example on this place is all Google

155
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,970
yes you might know whatever and

156
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,130
when they find them they will of me the
attack is

157
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,510
by old ladies a and me fight you

158
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,730
looks like this also by everywhere

159
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,080
