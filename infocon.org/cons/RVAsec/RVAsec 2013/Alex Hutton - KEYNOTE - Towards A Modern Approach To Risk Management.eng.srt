what we do and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do it there for a</font>

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,670
while but what I my opinions are my own

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,630
they don't reflect the bank or any of

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,979
our customers or anything like that

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:20,490
before I worked at zions I work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to work with that team using individuals</font>

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,780
wanted to talk to you today a little bit

26
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,060
about risk management half of you just

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,369
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez and the other half you went</font>

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,789
okay good because I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

29
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:58,049
problems or some challenges talking to

30
00:01:53,789 --> 00:02:00,810
the business I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of throw</font>

31
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,149
this out that you can't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one without</font>

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,430
the other risk management or security

33
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,869
science it's kind of the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing at</font>

34
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,429
this point and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

35
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,959
little muddled and the waters are going

36
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,940
to get muddy or over the next five years

37
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,410
we'll talk about why that is anybody

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,410
know what this is this is a picture of

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:26,200
close<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will talk about insect so Lex</font>

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,600
said I'm speaking here as much my words

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,010
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much signs words as they are the</font>

43
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:36,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">say none the inspiration for this talk</font>

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,230
to a couple of pieces this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 1 this is</font>

45
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,910
operational risk which technology is

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,549
technically apart don't worry most

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,230
operas people have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what let</font>

48
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,410
technology or information secretes about

49
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,260
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good and if you're</font>

50
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:54,900
wondering a little bit about financial

51
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:58,030
crisis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll like inference and</font>

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,280
bayesian methods and so forth it's a fun

53
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:06,370
read the other inspiration is this when

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,660
I have been a consultant and when I have

55
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:14,680
worked in risk groups folks tend to

56
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,239
worry about where risk is not how much

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,120
risk they have there's a great story

58
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,280
behind this from my friend Jack Jones

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,769
when he was chief information security

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,709
officer at nationwide he was the brand

61
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,660
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciso at the time and he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

62
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,750
go in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Executive Council so</font>

63
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,519
he had like the CEO and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CFO the COO</font>

64
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,130
you know he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had everybody in the room</font>

65
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,860
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ask them for his 25</font>

66
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,950
million dollar budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until he</font>

67
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,380
prepped right like most of us do he

68
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,810
perhaps a lot he had all of these

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,329
controls he wanted to buy and invest in

70
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,160
an increase right and all of these

71
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,470
threats he was all worried about not

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,170
stuff and he talking talking talking

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,090
about seven minutes in kind of what

74
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,790
happened was this see if I goes wait

75
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,600
this is all fine jack let me ask you a

76
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:08,739
question how much risk do we have

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,870
and in jax like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're nationwide we got</font>

78
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,260
lots of risk you know what do you mean

79
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:17,260
how much risk he goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay CFO goes if I</font>

80
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,800
give you 25 million dollars how much

81
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:24,730
less risk while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have in jax like not</font>

82
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,050
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much but it's it's not a bad question</font>

83
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,960
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sit down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

84
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,550
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not unrealistic you know if my kid</font>

85
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,969
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and said dad I want ten</font>

86
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,650
dollars i'm gonna say why right that's

87
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that he was doing what's my return</font>

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,390
on my investment tell me what I'm

89
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,460
getting compliance only buys a piece of

90
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right be able to say well we get</font>

91
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulators off the back maybe</font>

92
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,370
they'll take the regulators on their

93
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:51,040
back so how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk we do we have is a</font>

94
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:56,950
great question even better question is

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,840
why okay so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with most of my</font>

96
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,210
audiences I like the level set a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

97
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,840
bit just so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a shared</font>

98
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:07,630
mindset there's no risk free there's no

99
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">such thing as secure you believe you've</font>

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">got something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is secure this might</font>

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">be difficult concepts here hopefully</font>

102
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">nobody thinks that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are secure risk</font>

103
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,370
is currently a hypothetical construct

104
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,150
and what that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this you can't</font>

105
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,470
touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you may be able to observe it</font>

106
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,120
but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we create in our</font>

107
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,450
minds and we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a little bit of</font>

108
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,310
of how we as humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> have dealt with</font>

109
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,990
hypothetical constructs and created

110
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,730
meaning out of them in the past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

111
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:42,160
little bit but you cannot touch risk

112
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last one is that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

113
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,820
different risk approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this</font>

114
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,820
is kind of interesting let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

115
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,110
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a bit here starting with</font>

116
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:58,480
what is risk if you go to your

117
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,180
dictionary on your laptop or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you bust</font>

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,630
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Webster's you're going to find a</font>

119
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,030
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different definitions and a</font>

120
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:12,070
bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> meanings sometimes as</font>

121
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:14,080
many as 12 right a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> example from my</font>

122
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,630
past has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time I ever ran</font>

123
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,880
across a chief risk officer was a big ol

124
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,360
financial institution

125
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,730
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florida and they had we had done</font>

126
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pen test we had found what you and I</font>

127
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:30,180
might we'll call an issue right so we

128
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:36,570
had the CIO the CRO CFO and CEO in the

129
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:38,970
room and we've got issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and the</font>

130
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">crl goes that's a risk the CI yoga</font>

131
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,390
that's a vulnerability the CFO goes

132
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,180
that's a threat we're all talking about

133
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,400
the same issue the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> set same object</font>

134
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,730
applying different semantic labels to

135
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,070
that and if you listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the word risk</font>

136
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,440
and frankly I'm sick of the word risk to

137
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,590
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth you'll hear a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

138
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,260
that what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the Japanese</font>

139
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,060
the Japanese didn't before<font color="#CCCCCC"> Western</font>

140
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,400
influence did not have a word<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

141
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,100
one of two civilizations that did not

142
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,830
have a word risk in their lexicon does

143
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,850
that mean they did not have the concept

144
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,650
absolutely not it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant when they</font>

145
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,870
were describing it they're a little more

146
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular so instead of saying pizza</font>

147
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,540
right they probably said oh you mean the

148
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,420
pie<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the tomato sauce and the cheese</font>

149
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,480
makes sense in the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we have</font>

150
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,000
different views of risk that we classify

151
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,970
by what we do first<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be financial</font>

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,220
risk when I deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cro he's got</font>

153
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,440
an entire side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house that's dealt</font>

154
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,590
with financial risk financial risk is

155
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,440
qualified like this I use baseball a lot

156
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,500
you'll forgive me if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like it</font>

157
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,450
but a financial risk is you've got an

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,420
investment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that investment is going</font>

159
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deviate from an expected return so</font>

160
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,550
you got a brave still in richmond you've

161
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,790
got a richmond brave right and at know

162
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:03,310
who is it now what

163
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,980
Wow okay so you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flying squirrel</font>

164
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,980
right and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have invested in</font>

165
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:12,130
this flying squirrel flights what are

166
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:15,730
you serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brown you need a t-shirt</font>

167
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:17,080
before you leave vm so you've got this

168
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,540
flying squirrel and somebody's probably

169
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,609
given this 17 18 year old kid how much

170
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,370
like three million dollars whatever but

171
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,470
they expect something out of them now a

172
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,600
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things may happen he may be</font>

173
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,880
completely healthy and not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

174
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,680
up the standards he may break his arm he

175
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,360
may not live up to standards he may

176
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,579
exceed his standards he may<font color="#E5E5E5"> become an</font>

177
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,830
all-star my st. Louis Cardinals when

178
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,360
they had this player named Albert Pujols

179
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,220
they ran into that problem because he

180
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">was way too good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right they had</font>

181
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,630
investment there it went way too good<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

182
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,770
them and they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford to keep</font>

183
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">him thank goodness so a financial risk</font>

184
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,030
that's what people are talking about you

185
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,870
got a deviation from expected return

186
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,150
engineering risk that you and I are

187
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:02,290
familiar with that comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Dutch</font>

188
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and what you basically have system</font>

189
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,599
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and its operating at what</font>

190
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,130
you expect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it deviates from</font>

191
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,470
that only degrades though your file

192
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,090
doesn't really operate at 110 120

193
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,810
percent this isn't the enterprise that

194
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,580
we're dealing with right you've got

195
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that happens now back to our</font>

196
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,810
pitcher example right he's got an arm

197
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,390
that arm has a certain amount that he

198
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,489
can give us but if he needs tommy john

199
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,650
surgery it's not going to be able to

200
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,120
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much at all right and even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

201
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that surgery it may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

202
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,890
see this as a symptom of an audit driven

203
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,109
approach where is the risk right figure

204
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,840
out where your bridge is is hurting you

205
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,170
and go reinforce that bridge anybody

206
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,660
know what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a picture of Tacoma</font>

207
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,979
Narrows right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever see this on</font>

208
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,959
youtube if you don't what this is this

209
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:01,090
is bridge they built in the 40s I think

210
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:03,610
and in certain wind conditions it goes

211
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,770
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it went like that right and</font>

212
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:09,460
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see here is is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

213
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,949
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on that and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

214
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,480
we do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> risking control self assessment</font>

215
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,149
that's an operational risk term

216
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,310
and sure enough if you if you live with

217
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:22,480
somebody who has not risk this when they

218
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:25,630
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on you you have this equation</font>

219
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay which is and the concept of</font>

220
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,130
inherent risk minus our controls equals

221
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:34,180
our residual<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk anybody seen this</font>

222
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:36,060
before a couple unfortunate folks right

223
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,339
what this is how awesome is your bridge

224
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,319
that's what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is talking about the</font>

225
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,510
palm with that is what everybody who's

226
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,990
ever tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually capture a flag</font>

227
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:49,209
knows when does<font color="#CCCCCC"> know of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> motivation right</font>

228
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,430
when doesn't say no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to really</font>

229
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:54,250
going to get this bridge now right and

230
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:58,209
rain does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to evade the bridges</font>

231
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:01,680
defenses right the final problem of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

232
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:04,119
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if this system is faulty by design</font>

233
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,550
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> better get some some systems</font>

234
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,550
that are faulty by design if the system

235
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,839
is faulty by design reinforcements only

236
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:15,439
addressing the symptom

237
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,330
okay it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not until you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just destroy the</font>

238
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">bridge and rebuild it that you're</font>

239
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,760
actually addressing the design last

240
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,920
problem with this is that it doesn't

241
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,920
really give us a good view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

242
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,829
system right so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concept</font>

243
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,319
called complex systems right and it's an

244
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,570
interconnected parts and it has

245
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,820
synergistic qualities you push on it and

246
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,730
something crazy happens over at the

247
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">other end right you have cross-site</font>

248
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,900
scripting and all of a sudden some other

249
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,180
systems somewhere far away is

250
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,569
compromised sound kind of familiar to us

251
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,599
all a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit right so you have these</font>

252
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,550
unintended consequences that are

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,990
basically emergent properties if you

254
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,020
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about specifically my</font>

255
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:03,320
favorite example is this I work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

256
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,470
team prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my working with them they</font>

257
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,510
were bought up by a great big team right

258
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,490
and the great big<font color="#E5E5E5"> team was by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this great</font>

259
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,790
big company they said well you got to

260
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,350
have strong passwords on these things

261
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,240
right and you special character you need

262
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,780
numbers you need eight characters at

263
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,330
least anybody else suffer through that

264
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,980
and Philander<font color="#CCCCCC"> thrive so these were</font>

265
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,500
clever risk guys though and what they

266
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,290
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was this they made a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little study</font>

267
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,510
and they showed that you're actually

268
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,420
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to die in a car accident</font>

269
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:38,210
trying to unlock<font color="#CCCCCC"> your phone than hat</font>

270
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:45,439
then to you have suffer a data breach by

271
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:47,300
using a simple to character password do

272
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,130
you think the large organization change

273
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,390
policy ya know<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now that's</font>

274
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,620
interesting but what that organization

275
00:12:53,390 --> 00:13:02,750
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said is we would rather kill you</font>

276
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:04,310
then suffer a data breach right I think

277
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,470
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kill you than to face the</font>

278
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,280
wrath of internal or external auditors

279
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,360
but anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry if there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> auto yours</font>

280
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,220
so we may be dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a complex</font>

281
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,350
adaptive system actually called a lady

282
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,510
who's an expert on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> she worked for</font>

283
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spafford to Purdue for a little bit</font>

284
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,830
and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait tell me if we offer she</font>

285
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,110
goes there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> litmus test it's not</font>

286
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,470
binary you got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of smells like</font>

287
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,870
that's why that word may

288
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:31,970
in this slide right but it sure does

289
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:35,760
feel like it last problem with this

290
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,790
science is hard this is a gentleman in

291
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,830
Thomas Kuhn you smarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> than all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

292
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,319
and he's a philosophy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> science and he</font>

293
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,900
said there's this thing called a proto

294
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,280
science right there's a difference Udo

295
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,970
science and a proto sign sort of

296
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sciences somewhat random fact gathering</font>

297
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,940
mainly of<font color="#E5E5E5"> readily accessible data a</font>

298
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:01,250
morass of interesting trivial and

299
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:04,860
irrelevant observations I call that sand

300
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,020
top 20 so a variety of theories that

301
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">respond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from what he calls philosophical</font>

302
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,360
speculation and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are critical</font>

303
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,620
controls just kidding if I didn't warn

304
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you i'm going to make fun of all of us</font>

305
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:22,140
myself included throughout this but the

306
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:25,920
idea here is he sees science growing and

307
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:29,250
as I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it we very much fit the</font>

308
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,370
proto science category this is another

309
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:35,430
smart gentleman named<font color="#E5E5E5"> dan gear and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

310
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:38,030
is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> science and measurement</font>

311
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,380
he says we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an ordinal scale at best</font>

312
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:43,370
we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tell you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X is better</font>

313
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,370
or why but we can't figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

314
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,580
so I thought well<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez we have this</font>

315
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:54,270
hypothetical construct called risk right

316
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,040
feels like it exists how does how have

317
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,000
we dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these things and how we</font>

318
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:04,069
gone from hypothetical to science in the

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">past so I'd like to use speed as a</font>

320
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,740
example right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because in terms of</font>

321
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:13,200
metrics the first metric was very binary

322
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,700
around speak are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you faster than the</font>

323
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">woolly mammoth or not it's survival</font>

324
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,900
based right then you get the next step

325
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">which is comparison which is you've got</font>

326
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ulysses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and homer and they're running a</font>

327
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,390
race in the Olympic someone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> fashion</font>

328
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other work right now as the</font>

329
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,199
distances get shorter it's harder to

330
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,240
measure that as they get longer than you

331
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,070
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sun was</font>

332
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,240
here when one got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the finish line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

333
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:40,140
Sun was there when the other one

334
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,209
it right finally right we got to

335
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,260
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called units we were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

336
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:49,500
say okay there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are 24 hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in day 60</font>

337
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,930
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minute yada yada right so</font>

338
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,120
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if science is based</font>

339
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,069
on have having these inductive

340
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,610
observations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sciences based on the</font>

341
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,470
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure in terms of units</font>

342
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,560
where do we sit as information security

343
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:08,850
and risk in the family<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sciences the</font>

344
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:14,550
answer is not good okay the family of

345
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">sciences we're like my head hey if you</font>

346
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I'm kidding let's take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CBS s for</font>

347
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,849
example now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick on them</font>

348
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,980
they're really good guys they know that

349
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,089
they have this problem they love to fix

350
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,100
it i sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a Def Con panel with some</font>

351
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:31,920
folks here and they were they were nice

352
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,320
foot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

353
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,349
using them as they are symptomatic right

354
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,300
of how we deal with risk and security if

355
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,420
you take this the base equation

356
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,889
multiplies impact by point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and exploit</font>

357
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,410
ability by point for

358
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,670
right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot like saying jet</font>

359
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:55,868
engine<font color="#CCCCCC"> times peanut butter equals shiny</font>

360
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:57,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">right it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it may be right okay but</font>

361
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:59,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it's wrong you don't know why and</font>

362
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,419
when it's right you kind of don't know

363
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:04,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">really why the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is</font>

364
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:10,029
is I love point<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and point for folks</font>

365
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:13,569
decimals aren't magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you can</font>

366
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:16,299
add a zero before<font color="#E5E5E5"> or after that number</font>

367
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,579
all right and it doesn't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

368
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,879
meaning of the outcome you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

369
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:25,750
wrong all right that if the world does

370
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,809
not work that way so finally if we have

371
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,580
this and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and you</font>

372
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:32,320
got some guy coming in and trying to

373
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,289
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about this this is called a</font>

374
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,059
point probability for a complex system

375
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:39,460
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start aggregating this up and</font>

376
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:42,760
saying well in aggregate all our web

377
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,100
servers are low or medium or higher or

378
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,289
an aggregate this is how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works right</font>

379
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,379
and especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

380
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:52,149
these qualitative descriptors that

381
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,029
doesn't work either there's people who

382
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:56,678
are much smarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we are that's that</font>

383
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:59,289
have decided that that was silly a long

384
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,929
long time ago and yet we continue to do

385
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,730
it right so in a complex system actually

386
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:06,159
what you're what you're dealing with is

387
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,779
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find patents right anybody</font>

388
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,779
know what that's a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

389
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:16,510
areas its flight it'sit's<font color="#E5E5E5"> us flight</font>

390
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,510
patterns and paths but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the</font>

391
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,040
United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States everybody everybody you</font>

392
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see that I kind of went others</font>

393
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,940
Florida and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> California and good</font>

394
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">night everybody's flying through denver</font>

395
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:32,440
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> united so r HC essays is commonly</font>

396
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,820
performed this is basically a cargo lady

397
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody know to call her go call this</font>

398
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:41,409
those some people do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who don't</font>

399
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:43,570
what happened was in World War two you

400
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,190
know the Marines in the Navy went island

401
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopping they would go to this tiny</font>

402
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,290
island and they build up you know maybe

403
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">a port but certainly having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to airfield</font>

404
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:56,470
and all this cargo would come in and the

405
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,300
natives would benefit a little bit right

406
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,030
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of a sudden they</font>

407
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,070
assist the foods and material goods that

408
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,850
they never seen before right and then

409
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:09,580
but then the Marines and the Navy left

410
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so did it with so went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font>

411
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,179
went the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good times for the natives</font>

412
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so what they did is they wanted</font>

413
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,920
them to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back now they didn't</font>

414
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,470
understand what was going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> as did was</font>

415
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:25,690
they built planes and vehicles and

416
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:29,110
airfields like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Gilligan's Island</font>

417
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:31,090
right and then started praying to these

418
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,800
things so that the cargo and the good

419
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,439
times would come back bring us back the

420
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,120
liquor<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whatever it was that's</font>

421
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,070
that's that's what people mean when they

422
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,669
talk about a cargo call we're much like

423
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if we're we're trying very hard to</font>

424
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,470
have equations metrics meaning but

425
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,360
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we should all</font>

426
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,260
understand this is that we're creating

427
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,790
bamboo airplanes and boosts essence so

428
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,760
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk meant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was something else</font>

429
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,770
and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call this medical risk</font>

430
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:04,540
note that it's from criminology<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so</font>

431
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:08,379
this is the snow and he was the founder

432
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:10,000
of what we might call epidemiology we do

433
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,660
called epidemiology when i called the

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,150
founder and if you've seen tuff T's book

435
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,700
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> data viz this is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

436
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,380
great data visualizations in london

437
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,429
during his time there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cholera</font>

438
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">outbreak and at the time people</font>

439
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,070
believed that cholera was due to ill

440
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:30,080
wind or whatever it was right and he

441
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,980
said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's that's horse</font>

442
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:38,269
pucky and what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was he putted he</font>

443
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,860
took a map and he put a dot where

444
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,980
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> died and he had this</font>

445
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,969
hypothesis they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove it was</font>

446
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:52,039
actually a waterborne illness<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

447
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x's became pumps kind of pumps</font>

448
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,539
where people go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get their water and</font>

449
00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this you can see the cluster</font>

450
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:02,110
around that X right there right you

451
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,840
totally see that cluster and sure enough

452
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:09,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">not pump lives to today somebody had</font>

453
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,678
built a pump three meters away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

454
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:16,580
abandoned cesspool

455
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:19,700
alright<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so they were getting cholera</font>

456
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:23,980
by what<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we know of it today so</font>

457
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:28,960
epidemiology there are risk factors

458
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,220
determinants that we find markers

459
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,190
everybody has heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old sauk</font>

460
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,740
correlation is not necessary causation

461
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,289
but it sure does help us understand

462
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,529
what's going on if we bring in a

463
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:44,480
deductive model to back that up it's

464
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:47,419
basically the means to find patterns

465
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,730
right so it's designed to address the

466
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:52,340
problems we face<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we look at complex</font>

467
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:56,659
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dr. Richard cook he's made an</font>

468
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,720
awesome document here this link<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

469
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">embedded in the slides that you can have</font>

470
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,299
it deals with complex systems and

471
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,860
failures and I put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of quotes up</font>

472
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:09,769
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think these are awesome when I</font>

473
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,949
read these again there's no litmus test

474
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:16,970
for complexity and security<font color="#CCCCCC"> but boy it</font>

475
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,619
felt good the complex the complexity of

476
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,200
assistance makes it impossible for them

477
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:24,470
to run without multiple vulnerabilities

478
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,909
being present right these are

479
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,600
individually and sufficient to cause

480
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:30,710
failure but you get enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

481
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,639
bad things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen and they're</font>

482
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:36,169
always running in degraded mode security

483
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:38,889
or risk is a characteristic of the

484
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,269
systems and not their components

485
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:46,039
anybody's done pen testing to tell you

486
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:48,830
this right you're attacking the system

487
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:52,840
itself as much as you're tacking an

488
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:56,480
individual server or individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user</font>

489
00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:00,249
emergent property all that great stuff I

490
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,960
strong it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 323 page document</font>

491
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:05,600
and it's just a collection of kind of

492
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,840
these sorts of bits of wisdom that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

494
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,590
good time

495
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:16,130
so we're worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how awesome our</font>

496
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:19,550
bridge is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and everybody is telling</font>

497
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:22,360
us that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat but you need more you</font>

498
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:25,760
might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rethink our approach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

499
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's seriously right what would</font>

500
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,010
happened if your<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor operated like we</font>

501
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,080
do with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> business right it becomes</font>

502
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:37,490
difficult for the business to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out and</font>

503
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,710
play but the good news is there are some

504
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,740
examples but this is a friend of mine

505
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,140
named<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jean Kim and he did the through</font>

506
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,390
the IT process<font color="#E5E5E5"> Institute he looked at a</font>

507
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,720
series called visible ops for IT and

508
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:56,110
visible security and it was amazing what

509
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:59,570
they found right in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of of</font>

510
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:02,330
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did not have that had</font>

511
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,600
fewer incidents right organizations that

512
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,179
did not have significant outages I one

513

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great things that they found was</font>

514
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,750
the organization's one of the weird

515
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,310
things that correlated with

516
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:18,830
organizations at a lower amounts of

517
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:20,629
incidents the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CISO was ex-military or X</font>

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,668
audit

519
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,169
I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was fascinating there was</font>

520
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:28,650
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that I got I was fortunate</font>

521
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:31,559
to be a part of p.r Tippett and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Verizon</font>

522
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,880
and the data breach reports we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

523
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,860
something called bears to start

524
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,070
categorizing these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open</font>

525
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:40,469
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> object oriented model each</font>

526
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:43,470
incident each piece of an incident had

527
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:47,010
an agent had an action an asset in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

528
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:49,350
attribute right somebody hurts us they

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:53,340
hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and then something bad</font>

530
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:55,439
happens okay more often than not series

531
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,908
of those things and what was cool when

532
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,730
we went through this and I wish I had

533
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:02,220
built this but somebody else on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team</font>

534
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:06,929
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it he's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great guy in</font>

535
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:09,059
Chris Porter is holy cow you've got your

536
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:12,090
actions now we're hacking social miss

537
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:14,639
you Sarah physical environment where it

538
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:18,120
came from external internal partner

539
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,549
threats what they acted against servers

540
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,219
networks user devices offline data and

541
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:25,799
then confidentiality and integrity what

542
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:32,100
was compromised so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool about this</font>

543
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:34,370
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge portion of it is blank so if</font>

maybe we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing them to be super</font>

breaches a relatively simple stuff but

549
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:50,250
the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that they are</font>

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:53,820
these are patterns right these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

are people dying<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Cholera near a water</font>

553
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,620
but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

worried necessary about who built<font color="#CCCCCC"> it how</font>

556
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,758
was built how we're operating a friend

557
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:14,340
of mine likes to say we've spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:18,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">last 15 20 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as an industry of</font>

installers by a 1u box install it and

560
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:25,209
don't worry necessarily about operating

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,649

than the capital expenditure what we

00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:33,309
really should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worried about really is</font>

565
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,100
how much are we associated with failures

566
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:38,139
how our behaviors associate us with

567
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,980
failures as an uncomfortable

568
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:43,389
conversation because it involves IT we

569
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,600
should also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worried about how good</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">our lifestyle is right the concept</font>

571
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,090
called micro<font color="#CCCCCC"> mort's that comes to us</font>

572
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:53,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">from medical folks and the micro board</font>

573
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,379
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one in a million chance of death</font>

574
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,269
you smoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> one cigarette you get three</font>

575

microboards three<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million chance of</font>

576
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:03,190
death right and so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do inherent</font>

577
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,889
minus controls equals residual we're

578
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,350
really saying did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I smoke a cigarette or</font>

579
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:10,360
not what we're not saying is the most

580
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,149
audit standards almost every audit

581
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,689
standard I've seen never says hair you

582
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:18,639
smoking two packs a day so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two</font>

583
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">different behaviors and two different</font>

584
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:29,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">outcomes you're going to get so let's</font>

585
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:31,570
talk a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about some change I'll</font>

586
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,360
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a manifesto for you</font>

587
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,999
here security and risk management must

588
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,059
provide value and address the need and

589
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:42,999
be ethical real simple kind of credo

590
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:45,820
that I'd like my team to live by right

591
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:48,009
to be ethical we need to be data

592
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,549
scientists this is data scientists<font color="#E5E5E5"> ryan</font>

593
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:56,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">gosling and a little bit of probability</font>

594
00:27:51,549 --> 00:28:00,668
joke for you guys bayesian jokes not so

595
00:27:56,379 --> 00:28:03,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">good take slide out but basically in</font>

596
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:05,919
operating as a data scientist at a very

597
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,480
high level there's only four things to

598
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,250
really study<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got the threats you got</font>

599
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,950
assets<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got the impacts and got the</font>

600
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,870
controls now it's worth noting that if

601
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,130
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> these boardroom discussions are</font>

602
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,969
going to have discussion got with

603
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:22,730
auditors my auditors especially you have

604
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,650
all four to get risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you if you</font>

605
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,990
don't have all four in the equation you

606
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:31,309
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something but it ain't risk</font>

607
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:33,679
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right and an impact is not how</font>

608
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:37,160
the system is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail impact is</font>

609
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,460
whose cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center is going to pay for it</font>

610
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,010
you're going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

611
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,110
understand data a big ol pot of data and

612
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:48,679
some models to help you interpret it

613
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:51,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing those circles back in</font>

614
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,850
you've got the individual circles as

615
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,639
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes there's overlap but you</font>

616
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,439
get the picture you bring together to

617
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,870
understand risk within the context of a

618
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,730
framework well i like to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> varus as</font>

619
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,500
that and then there's models and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

620
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,620
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of models that my team uses</font>

621
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:10,460
right and that synthesizes knowledge all

622
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:12,799
those overlaps so at zions we pretty

623
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,750
much quickly figured out we got to be

624
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:20,240
data-driven we have to know the

625
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:23,240
individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts and the relationships</font>

626
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,250
between those parts right and then we

627
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:31,480
can start guessing the whole so like

628
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:35,360
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> varus uses that we've got a</font>

629
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,610
boatload of data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

630
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,309
need in order to do that how big is a

631
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:43,040
boatload well if this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very sort</font>

632
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've got this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

633
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,530
million combinations this is at its

634
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:52,040
highest level we we have millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

635
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:55,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">millions of the squares right and so how</font>

636
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,080
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a boatload a lot and we pretty</font>

637
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:01,330
quickly realized that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

638
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:04,659
need a bigger boat one

639
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,040
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh so here's the big dicked apiece</font>

640
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:10,690
anybody sick of hearing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data</font>

641
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,670
yet yeah good for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'll</font>

642
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,520
take why you're sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hearing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

643
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:18,400
and what you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so we call</font>

644
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">it security data warehousing because</font>

645
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:25,150
we're cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but basically we</font>

646
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:28,110
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a data warehouse 1.2 petabytes what</font>

647
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:32,250
we've done at the bank is of the CSO

648
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:37,570
that I report to I'm now peers with

649
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:39,760
physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp dr fraud and info SEC okay</font>

650
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,290
makes sense so you have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

651
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

652
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,659
organization that way we can get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

653
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:53,110
those various categories and get out of

654
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:56,710
error coming to us physical all of them

655
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:59,709
working to get there in a 1.2 petabyte a

656
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:04,090
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and we use Hadoop</font>

657
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:07,480
for that that's our boat and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

658
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:11,770
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it this way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of</font>

659
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,620
stuff it goes through MapReduce through

660
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">an each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L system and then my portion of</font>

661
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,040
it and we'll talk of different about how

662
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,690
fraud<font color="#E5E5E5"> infosec uses it but for risk</font>

663
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:24,270
management right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get Mongo couch we're</font>

664
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to play with couch a little bit</font>

665
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:30,070
and that supports my workflow or

666
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,229
analytics and reporting that little

667
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,689
thing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm able to do that sort of</font>

668
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,570
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it now this is no different</font>

669
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,970
whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> info SEC or fraud they just</font>

670
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a different perspective on it so</font>

671
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:46,960
conceptually you've got clouds and I

672
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,790
said clout you can punch me later you've

673
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,000
got all this information sitting out

674
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:54,010
there drop it all in Hadoop do some

675
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,900
MapReduce and then we do our analytics

676
00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:01,600
does that make more sense

677
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:05,190
okay this is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the mind map</font>

678
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:09,219
that we built for a vendor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAS app</font>

679
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:11,380
right and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the metadata that we</font>

680
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,330
associate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> without the CNA there is</font>

681
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:18,190
a certification and accreditation of the

682
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:19,870
vendor themselves that comes through so

683
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,370
we at least capture this data we do that

684
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,080
in an interview process we stopped

685
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,360
asking for a bunch of controls we

686
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,159
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out pretty quickly that people</font>

687
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,810
can lie<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us just as well as we can lie</font>

688
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,670
to other vendors about how many controls

689
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:35,950
are in place so what we do is we do an

690
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,460
interview and we try to test how

691
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:42,880
maturity how mature you are a lot

692
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:45,790
different amount of questions so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

693
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,350
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data so what we've done what</font>

694
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,420
I like to think of it is actually this

695
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:52,540
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a picture of a visualization of the</font>

696
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">human genome I'm trying to do genomic</font>

697
00:32:52,540 --> 00:33:03,909
sequencing on the bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> cork that's it</font>

698
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:05,530
around risks<font color="#CCCCCC"> clause to keeper all that's</font>

699
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:10,570
well and good but unless you're stopping

700
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:13,270
bad guys it's stupid this is a fake data

701
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:16,379
processing work flow all thats a risk

702
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:19,870
management is an intelligence function I

703
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,030
realize that's kind of duh but think

704
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:25,179
about it whether i'm working with fraud

705
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:27,310
and low-level fraud<font color="#CCCCCC"> in lists or whether</font>

706
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm reporting to any number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of board of</font>

707
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:33,070
directors we're actually a bank or so i

708
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:36,310
have the the pleasure of reporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> 29</font>

709
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,730
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> boards of directors i'm giving</font>

710
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">them Intel helping them make a decision</font>

711
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:46,390
so the three types that we see here i

712
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,370
kind of deal in real-time tactical and

713
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:51,130
strategic is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it i'm</font>

714
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:54,090
only one of these pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time this</font>

715
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:57,580
is where info second fraud come together

716
00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:01,480
and you see risks<font color="#E5E5E5"> role is kind of my</font>

717
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:03,970
role there right it's basically mining

718
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,789
that Hadoop cluster and trying to do

719
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:10,579
near real-time

720
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:13,190
detect and respond tactical security ops

721
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:15,710
there's a feedback loop between the

722
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:18,149
director of info SEC and myself there

723
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,089
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of hot zones are</font>

724
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:25,049
where to kind of go<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus efforts and</font>

725
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:27,179
then I'm a I'm the icing on the cake I

726
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:29,429
do high-level patterns trending and

727
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,319
reporting but the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

728
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:34,970
there's feedback loop<font color="#E5E5E5"> between all of us</font>

729
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:38,279
now what's cool about this is that

730
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:41,129
machine learning is helping us stop bad

731
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:46,169
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right the reason to go out and</font>

732
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:48,839
get data sources from nurse not spin

733
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:51,808
particular vendor but you know the

734
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:54,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk-based security folks out there the</font>

735
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:57,180
reason to go do that is so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

736
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">start stopping bad guys with a</font>

737
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,279
combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bacterial analytics and</font>

738
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,680
machine work that's why big<font color="#E5E5E5"> gate is a</font>

739
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,680
big deal but here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crux of that</font>

740
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,270
what your vendors don't understand it's

741
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,640
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Big Data you do a lot with</font>

742
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,980
little data if you have a right

743
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,109
hypothesis and have a right hypothesis

744
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,599
you need to have a data scientist let me

745
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:22,290
give you a personal example of where

746
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,049
this industry is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going ok I had the</font>

747
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,630
pleasure of being invited to sit and

748
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:31,619
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a big data security vendor</font>

749
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:34,500
recently I am like huh yeah okay I'll go

750
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:35,640
listen to this whatever so I sit through

751
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,280
and I'm sharing a whole lot about

752
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,900
throughput from this folks I can

753
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,059
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after listening to them</font>

754
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,400
why some people think of big data is

755
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:46,290
nothing more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim warmed over ladies</font>

756
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,059
and gentlemen it's not let me tell you

757
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,450
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as this vendor has done</font>

758
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:53,250
their spiel i said sweet that's

759
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,680
interesting stuff looks like you have

760
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,540
some neat one they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually were three</font>

761
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,419
you you know with some interesting rack

762
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,250
mount technology and again it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

763
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,170
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> big data solution is built so</font>

764
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can point something go there's my</font>

765
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:10,470
big data solution it's the orange<font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

766
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:14,549
right but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that that's a sweet</font>

767
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:16,109
solution so let me ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this how I'm</font>

768
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:18,210
here all this stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a little</font>

769
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:19,799
familiar how am I connecting my HR

770
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,200
system with that

771
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,690
how many get data from a HR system onto

772
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,430
your big data solution and the vendor

773
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:30,050
looked at me like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was from freaking</font>

774
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:32,160
Mars like why would you want to do that

775
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">right i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of</font>

776
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,779
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that first my two</font>

777
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,480
favorite metrics riskiest cost center

778
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,690
and stupidest employee right those are

779
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,480
those are great great metrics for me to

780
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:48,180
have and they are there actionable

781
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,660
really from a political standpoint those

782
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,580
are crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> good actual metrics all right</font>

783
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,319
well in this vendor lets me that well

784
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,060
you wouldn't you just leave that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

785
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,090
over there on the HR system like back

786
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I don't know if you know about this</font>

787
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,570
big data stuff but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

788
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second thing I</font>

789
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,950
asked is this okay so you obviously have

790
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:11,520
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people buying your big data</font>

791
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,379
solution how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your CIS OS that</font>

792
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,430
have bought your solution have a data

793
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:21,030
scientist reporting directly to them

794
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:23,040
none not a one this guy's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what if</font>

795
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:26,340
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are it's because their medical and</font>

796
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,220
those guys are working on you know jeans

797
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,170
or something or they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in marketing you</font>

798
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,700
know like well then how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

799
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,800
this now<font color="#E5E5E5"> lass not to say we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

800
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,830
higher data scientists to take advantage

801
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">of behavioral analytics and to start</font>

802
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,660
stopping bad guys we at argue

803
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,120
organization we've had a really good

804
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,670
time taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> really smart security</font>

805
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:51,509
analysts and then giving them you know

806
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">are for beginners right or a handful of</font>

807
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,260
tool sets and letting them become

808
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,990
autodidact surround that but the point

809
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this if you're buying date big data</font>

810
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:03,060
solutions and you have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what data</font>

811
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">sciences is going to fail okay you're</font>

812
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,420
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to waste a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money the other</font>

813
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,109
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this let's say you did get a</font>

814
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:12,120
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientist like we did and RSA or</font>

815
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,790
some vendor came in and said hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

816
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:17,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Big Data solution and you buy us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

817
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,840
off-the-shelf everything's awesome your

818
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,490
data scientists look at them like they

819
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,730
were nuts like why would I buy a

820
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:27,089
security company solution right that's

821
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,100
like that's like going to a pizza shop

822
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,860
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask him if they can build me a moped</font>

823
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,779
yeah they're two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things maybe</font>

824
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,140
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you eat pizza while you're on</font>

825
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,510
your

826
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,000
head but why would I do that and why

827
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,789
would i<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay money Hadoop is free ours</font>

828
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,710
free there are gobs of free tools maybe

829
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:46,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll spend some money on this blog so</font>

830
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:49,260
data big date is not the solution data

831
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:52,319
science is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay as for those of you are</font>

832
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,059
sick of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing about this stuff that's</font>

833
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:55,920
because nobody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you the</font>

834
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,869
hard story no vendors ready to tell you

835
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,920
the hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> story that the answer is in</font>

836
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:06,390
headcount not in capex thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so</font>

837
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,250
let me give you some current successes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

838
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,730
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about on riskiest call center</font>

839
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:17,119
time of connection is great so badge

840
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:21,990
system desktop connection HR database

841
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:26,609
why is so and so's system connecting to

842
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">China at three in the morning right what</font>

843
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:32,339
is he doing why is somebody in

844
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,558
engineering connecting to China<font color="#E5E5E5"> at three</font>

845
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:37,109
in the morning right you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue well</font>

846
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,089
you know you should ought only<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry</font>

847
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:43,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">about connections with China there the</font>

848
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:44,970
apt but the reality is if you're a

849
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,619
member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defense industrial base</font>

850
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:50,058
are already connecting to China for

851
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:52,500
valid reasons right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

852
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">manufacturing piece you're doing that so</font>

853
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,809
and then systems connected is wonderful

854
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:01,289
it's it's real time you know when you

855
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:04,019
connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our bank and start to do wire</font>

856
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:07,680
transfers try to do wire transfers we

857
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:10,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">already have behavioral analytics we</font>

859
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:15,690
not you're compromised so that's been

860
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,130
key in keeping our fraud lights rates

861
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:22,730
lowest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry we have to chill</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">decision-making</font>

863
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:28,860
also some state analysis there we use

864
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:36,499
find the qualitative means but if you

865
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:37,699
find some smart kid on this campus

866
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:39,890
they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build you a</font>

871
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:52,788
measure myself so in fair you've got a

some frequency of touching you in order

00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:16,038
people yell about antivirus and firewall

882
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:17,719
is not being effective well they're

883
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,989
effective but they're effective against

884
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:22,699
a certain capability level they're

885
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:25,099
completely ineffective against other

886
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:30,589
capabilities the strength of our

887
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:31,999
controls we use a ratio scale comparing

888
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:35,319
ourselves against the population there

889
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:37,339
are the models that I can't expose there

890
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,558
but we do that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're not</font>

891
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:44,150
multiplying jet engine by my peanut

892
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:47,329
butter and that gets us to a bayesian

893
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:50,390
likelihood over here we've got impacts

894
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:51,949
and we do rough activity-based cost

895
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,679
accounting what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd do a quantitative</font>

out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see most of the time</font>

it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's costing us</font>

903
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:14,689
between 10,000 and you know probably

904
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:17,179
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight million dollars on the skip</font>

905
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:19,640
with large concentrations closer to a

906
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:21,829
million I hate logarithmic scales so

907
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:24,650
what I did was I actually change this to

908
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,839
a surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> area to show executives where</font>

909
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:31,130
I said well we ran a bunch of

910
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:33,589
simulations most of the time was here

911
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:36,679
but you need to see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron may not</font>

912
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:38,749
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it but you know there may be</font>

913
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a very small dot there that's</font>

your tail risk

915
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:46,069
so that's what fair does for us when we

916
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,710
look at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's been really</font>

917
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:51,829
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> I personally have used fear with</font>

how well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> living so fair tells me</font>

931
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,579
that i smoke in my smoking a cigarette

932
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,680
or how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> smoke cigarettes i'm smoking</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is do I have a lifestyle that's</font>

don't realize it because it's happening

936
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:37,280
all over my organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what we</font>

937
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,920
do is we do a little bit of a touch

938
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,780
point with folks so at least once a

939
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,030
quarter I'm reaching out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy who</font>

940
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,910
actually has the cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center and I'm</font>

941
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:49,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving them the dollar amounts but I'm</font>

942
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:52,490
also telling them whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're</font>

943
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:54,500
you know kind of 42 your old slightly

944
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:59,540
overweight guys who need to exercise

945
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">more and drink too much but I really see</font>

946
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,910
this as this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what's</font>

947
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:11,230
interesting to me is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

948
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:11,230
talk to you look at ISO or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

949
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,730
risk IT from well I guess now it's

950
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,348
incorporated into cobit you look at

951
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,710
these standards and they're built to

952
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:23,859
give you one true metric

953
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:26,020
right now for<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and years and years</font>

954
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:27,009
we didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with baseball cards in</font>

955
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,070
fact you can look at the back of

956
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,480
baseball card and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see hey</font>

957
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,670
there's all these sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

958
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,680
back to the the comparison stuff right

959
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,060
this is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> baseball</font>

960
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,859
card where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> only give us one metric</font>

961
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,520
which is batting average but they do

962
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:45,339
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us this wonderful qualitative label</font>

963
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,200
on this Kevin Connor's guy a colorful

964
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:49,540
hard hitting first baseman I don't know

965
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,700
what colorful was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> euphemism for in the</font>

966
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:56,230
50s but it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty fun but you can</font>

967
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,020
now take this and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is baseball</font>

reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm and good night you can</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">people want to fix an easy than the hard</font>

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,930
he's the father of quality circles and

980
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:34,030
he created what was the fish diagram

981
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,830
anybody's heard of a fish or<font color="#CCCCCC"> nishikawa</font>

00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:41,740
good so for those of you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fish</font>

1005
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:43,140
what my team does is if they want to

1006
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:44,700
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a problem right instead of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">saying well this could happen and that</font>

1012
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,119
out do a little basic threat modeling

1013
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,519
here and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1014
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:08,130
go to data source and I mean you say so

1015
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:11,959
let's go to data loss database and let's

1016
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,959
try and find how many data breaches

1017
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:21,710
contain the word iPad what's the risk

1018
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,390
right what's the risk for Westeros now

1019
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from what the risk forecast</font>

1020
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,460
is because the half and you just went

1021
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">agency iPads is risky of course there's</font>

1022
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,900
some risk inherent enter the question is

1023
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:37,220
how much not where it is and so there's

1024
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:40,820
a risk forecast as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'll</font>

1025
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:44,000
leave you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of with this I'll steal</font>

1026
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:47,930
from Daily Show moment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> then and give</font>

1027
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,820
this to my guys I'm sick of the

1028
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:52,669
confusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> around big data and sick of</font>

1029
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:55,250
the confusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the word risk</font>

1030
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,430
hearing it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten different people</font>

1031
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:02,270
heck I have I have the largest formal

1032
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:04,190
risk group in the organization and yet

1033
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,960
there are literally hundreds of risk

1034
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,550
people with risk management in their

1035
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,520
title that do nothing around this

1036
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">management so my moment has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infuse this</font>

1038
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:17,930

1041
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:24,710
communicate effectively what you're

00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:28,910
talking about it's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese</font>

00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:30,650
prior to Western influence you're not

1044
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,480
using a crutch word you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

1045
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,100
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more specific has to be a little</font>

1046
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">more meaningful with the business</font>

1047
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,910
whether that business person is the guy

1048
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,070
running your sim or whether the business

1049
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:44,180
person is your CEO yeah so it's

1050
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:45,770
everybody wants everything to be black

1051
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,080
and white it's a lot more greater than

1052
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,490
that and that's why somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> just asked</font>

1053
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,830
me risk management art versus science

1054
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,709
i'm like it's neither right you're a

1055
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:57,020
craftsman and scientific tools and other

1056
00:48:54,710 --> 00:49:00,230
tools help you as a craftsman in basing

1057
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:03,350
jiro Dreams of Sushi my goal is to be

1058
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:06,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero not just too</font>

1059
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:10,110
pretend<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I I can come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the one</font>

1060
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:12,420
true answer so in terms of making

1061
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:14,160
business justification absolutely right

1062
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:18,870
we can point to a be a data and our

1063
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:21,060
fraud rates we can point to attempts and

1064
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:24,359
we do exposure vs loss it's easier and

1065
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:27,480
fraud and banking understand that that

1066
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:30,030
it's that I I do I do recognize that I'm

1067
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,970
in a unique situation banks have a

1068
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:34,950
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're a series of</font>

1069
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:37,319
processes that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been really</font>

1070
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,470
careful about for a long time not as

1071
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:43,050
giving other people money right this is

1072
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:45,509
a been a more controlled environment

1073
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:47,610
than say software development or

1074
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:50,370
hardware engineering or building an

1075
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:53,520
airplane if you're bowing or even

1076
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:58,380
building a missile given the the recent

1077
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:02,490
news so it's easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to say the</font>

1078
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:05,640
exposure from wire fraud was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 million</font>

1079
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:08,160
dollars the actual wire fraud was four

1080
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,650
hundred thousand dollars and you're

1081
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,140
spending of ejection from a rough number

1082
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:15,240
this is not my budget or my<font color="#CCCCCC"> bosses</font>

1083
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,060
budget you're spending 20 million

1084
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:21,509
dollars right then the question is well

1085
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:24,870
what if i give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you 18 right and that's</font>

1086
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:28,140
where that's where you to take the the

1087
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:30,630
the concept of that's where we can't

1088
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,879
rely and why why<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our standards</font>

1089
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:36,000
aren't helping us because that's saying

1090
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,360
oh well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm an individual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i play some</font>

1091
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000

1092
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to cut back on the hours that</font>

cut back on the beer drinking or am I

1095
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,830
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut back on the tennis right</font>

1096
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:52,050
and is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tennis where there are a</font>

traveling away from my family that that

1099
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:58,680
may add to my stress right so you have

1100
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:01,620
to understand what makes healthy and

1101
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:04,140
what makes unhealthy right and not from

1102

1104
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,840
have to understand what makes healthy

1105
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,640
and unhealthy in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to that</font>

1106
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">point in my opinion in order to get that</font>

1107
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">point where you can say okay great</font>

225 million dollars what you're going to

1111
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:25,080
get for that is this right and if you

cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for cut me to 18 million dollars</font>

i can take that<font color="#CCCCCC"> from 10 different</font>

1114
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:31,050
disciplines and which do you want and

1115
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use like an analytical</font>

1116
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,830
hierarchical process for multi-criteria

1117

1118
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:39,180
get funky about it with the calculus of

1119
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,220
preference and say to them well what do

1120
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,750
you want to lose right let's go through

1121
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,890
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and objectively discuss what you</font>

1122
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:47,100
want to lose so it's not a political

1123
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:48,740
battle I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do that did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

of the day you've got to use a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

please

1134

how involved is the process of

collecting the data it is an insatiable

right so it's um the question is I'm

1139
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,960
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how do you figure out and how do</font>

1140
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data so how do you</font>

1141
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:08,320
figure out the data I try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start here</font>

1142
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,090
and then I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and work backwards and</font>

1143
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,070
this is again<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level right if you're</font>

1144
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:15,700
looking for like he's mapping these two

1145
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:18,400
there's there's literally hundreds of

1146
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:20,410
different things under under various go

1147
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,510
download the JSON and you'll see what

1148
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:25,660
I'm talking about that's why cost center

1149
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:28,510
or employee craziest employee or great

1150
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,210
metrics because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I can go down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1151
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:34,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> level using a formal ontology so</font>

1152
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:39,400
threat scenarios intelligence coming in

1153
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:41,590
mapped with mapped against using this

1154
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,270
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start identifying where</font>

1155
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:47,080
I'm going to get data and then it's we

1156
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:50,140
have you know massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> egl system extract</font>

1157
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:53,470
transform load so grab that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in we</font>

1158
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:55,600
also have some we have some unique

1159
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:59,529
technology some of those built in-house

1160
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:02,380
some that we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of testing for</font>

1161
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:04,750
other organizations that help us do it

1162
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">very quickly in the case of fraud</font>

1163
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:09,300
analytics

1164
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:11,250
but you get that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and it really</font>

1165
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,130
is political it really is in the name of

1166
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:16,290
security and fraud I claim etl to this

1167
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:18,720
server I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is your</font>

1168
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,610
audit so what stream fraud says I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1169
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,379
access to your server now I pull that in

1170
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,550
so that I can keep ahead of where

1171
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,830
they're going to audit next and what

1172
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:29,070
they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's everything right</font>

1173
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:31,890
it's the PMO tool right an understanding

1174
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:34,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the MapReduce effort helps us</font>

1175
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:37,290
understand what those think of them as

1176
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,120
feels right what the fields are and what

1177
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:41,730
we care about and why we would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1178
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:46,140
and then I can look through my my corpus

1179
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:49,230
or my library of assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are pulled</font>

1180
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:53,100
in and I can say and I want the badge

1181
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:56,310
system I want time of connection from

1182
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:59,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network equipment and what cost</font>

1183
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Center from HR and now I can understand</font>

1184
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:05,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">why somebody's computer is accessing the</font>

1185
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:08,899
internet while he's not even badge too

1186
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:10,549
right that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple example there</font>

1187
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,770
are obviously much more complex examples

1188
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:14,390
that we put through but it really is

1189
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:16,340
being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of</font>

1190
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,960
security and fraud I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create</font>

1191
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,280
an ET la or and there's not much you can

1192
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,410
do about it because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right and</font>

1193
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,380
policy to do that and then it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1194
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:27,319
much now understand what that data means

1195
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,730
to me it's all about hypothesis building

1196
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,240
based on threat modeling which is why

1197
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:33,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk fish pretty</font>

1198
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,979
across-the-board to create those

1199
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,980
hypotheses

1200
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:46,140
no no we've got the we've we've hired

1201
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,140
folks I i have i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> created some some</font>

1202
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,700
wonderful relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> VCU hack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1203
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,020
CIOs in the room want to play with this

1204
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,359
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hadoop you can</font>

1205
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:58,240
start with Mongo go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself some</font>

1206
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:03,100
of these biostats kids are kind of

1207
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:05,799
metrics kids it look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> are on the on</font>

1208
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,509
the resume and start getting start

1209
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,630
making real<font color="#E5E5E5"> good friends of them and</font>

1210
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:12,400
their their intern program unfortunate

1211
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,290
in salt lake city that they're a handful

1212
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,020
of decent programs that i can choose

1213
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:19,750
from very locally and pull people in we

1214
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:22,570
also like I said take the take some

1215
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:25,290
sharp people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are inclined and give them</font>

1216
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:29,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data science beginners toolkit right</font>

1217
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:33,279
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them handfuls of tools and let them</font>

1218
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:35,740
play around with it but no we do that

1219
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,630
ourselves I that's a that's a huge

1220
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,299
concern was relying on another another

1221
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:43,360
piece that work to do et al I'm not

1222
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get in somebody else's cute yes</font>

1223
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,570
please

1224
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">since I need to find science right</font>

1225
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,090
is

1226
00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:14,390
so so the normals the the the move Toa

1227
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:17,359
what I get that STFU sign so the move to

1228
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:18,680
normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> science is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be driven by</font>

1229
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,598
a number of indicators how do we know

1230
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,919
when we get there there are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

1231
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:25,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

1232
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell one are we making hypotheses are</font>

1233
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:31,038
republishing better papers are we making

1234
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:33,529
evidence-based decisions right is there

1235
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:37,329
is there a national or it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> anissa</font>

1236
00:57:33,529 --> 00:57:40,130
or some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> us organization actually</font>

1237
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:42,799
have more of a scientific bent than a

1238
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:45,950
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to test firewalls event and</font>

1239
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:48,109
make policy documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I got that but</font>

1240
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:50,410
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those off thanks a lot</font>

1241
00:57:48,109 --> 00:57:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">i appreciate</font>
