about what we're seeing is the the

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,410
digital battlefield and basically it's a

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,640
stories from the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines these are</font>

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,620
the types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were run into</font>

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,720
out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field every day during</font>

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,610
incident response types of battles were

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,940
fighting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were battling</font>

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,100
against what companies do right you have

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,630
some bad stories I could probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend</font>

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,910
this to like a tower talk if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,920
about war stories but go through this

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">today and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most if you could we save some</font>

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,619
questions to the end I'll give you guys

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:22,340
some time so who is fishnet security so

27
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:24,320
I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of us as kind of the MMA</font>

28
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,300
of the information security world we're

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,419
kind of a no-holds-barred information

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,880
security company we handle everything in

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,000
the information security space the

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,830
company itself isn't in swim<font color="#E5E5E5"> swim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lanes</font>

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,810
so to speak I worked at other companies

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,640
where the company just<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this or just</font>

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,080
does this and if you do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,119
and whether they got to go see somebody

37
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,030
else if it's kind of cool because we

38
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,920
handle everything into space we carve up

39
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security world about 10</font>

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,819
different ways I'm in charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of incident</font>

41
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,950
management any type of digital

42
00:01:52,819 --> 00:02:00,289
investigation is what is essentially

43
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:02,330
handled by my team my background got

44
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 13 or so years and information</font>

45
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,580
security worked at some of the big

46
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,810
software computer forensic investigative

47
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,930
software companies I've had a lot of

48
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,540
input into the design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these software</font>

49
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,700
solutions like in case ftk and advanced

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,079
products that are based upon it work

51
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,549
with them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and software development and</font>

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,959
out in the field during investigations

53
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:27,770
kind of work both hats so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we'll</font>

54
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,310
cover today is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> the war without ever</font>

55
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,310
firing

56
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,380
everybody here probably realizes that

57
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,560
we're at war today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been at war</font>

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,690
for over a decade this is a significant

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,820
war that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been going on really it is</font>

60
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,290
about 1999 1998<font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame I'll go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

61
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that more in a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I want to</font>

62
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,750
talk about who are the attackers the

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,480
targets and why what are their attack

64
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,370
methods what are the results how

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,720
companies are responding and our

66
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,580
recommendations so to kind of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the full war that we're seeing in</font>

68
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,270
cyberspace<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically for as long as the</font>

69
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet has existed it you know what</font>

70
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">started out as pranks and silly stuff</font>

71
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,399
turned into you now what's was a highly

72
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,530
evolved you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation of crime</font>

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,540
syndicates and selling of your

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,130
information whether it's your<font color="#CCCCCC"> company or</font>

75
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's your personal information there's</font>

76
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,329
like a basically a mall that you can buy

77
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about respective companies</font>

78
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,430
and there's advanced malware that's out

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,380
there harvesting all this data

80
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,750
collecting it aggregating<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's indexing</font>

81
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,180
it just wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a buyer and then you</font>

82
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,340
match up a seller and a buyer you know

83
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,160
the stereo stuff goes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> pastebin and</font>

84
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">then the places you know who you know</font>

85
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,220
places you don't want it so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of over</font>

86
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,860
some hacks that have happened just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last year 2012 not going to go in</font>

88
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,120
depth<font color="#E5E5E5"> into these but basically every</font>

89
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,580
sector has been under attack we see

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,800
these massive waves that go across these

91
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,750
various different sectors like there was

92
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,160
the you know the quarter where we had a

93
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,200
bunch of insurance companies and then

94
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,970
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quarter that we had grocery</font>

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,970
stores and then you know and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

96
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,700
moves on and on and on you know retail

97
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,700
this is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of retail course</font>

98
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:20,399
social media government card processors

99
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,930
insurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies even full supply</font>

100
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,940
chain attacks they don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit</font>

101
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,350
themselves just to a single company if

102
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,969
maybe they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get enough information</font>

103
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,590
from that one company maybe that

104
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,120
companies too hard to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into so</font>

105
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,030
they'll attack the supply chain above

106
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,710
and below and in contractors that

107
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,359
associate with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in even employees</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

108
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,580
home just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the information that</font>

111
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,669
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have in common all</font>

of these every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single one of these</font>

113
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,669
companies there's another company know

114
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:51,039
the presentation I've given where I

115
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,539
present with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> attorney and we go back</font>

116
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,188
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know what</font>

117
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:56,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened from the legal side every</font>

00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:58,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">single one of those resulted in a very</font>

120
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:06,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">Europe so who are they who the attackers</font>

121
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,860
who's perpetrating this and you know how

122
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:11,319
are they associated or how independence

123
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,179
are they well they start off with you

124
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,949
have nation states and and you know

125
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,388
crime syndicates but then there's also

126
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,829
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what I call hacktivists</font>

127
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,039
want to be using bored children and

128
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:23,139
what's what seems they all seem

129
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,818
independence you know when you think

130
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it but but they're really not</font>

131
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're all really kind of closely</font>

132
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:31,989
connected and what we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes is</font>

133
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:34,539
that the hacktivists knowingly or

134
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:36,429
unknowingly work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> nation states or</font>

135
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,889
crime syndicates it's easy to get them

136
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:41,169
riled up use them as a distraction and

137
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,179
they say at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty five percent of</font>

138
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">DDoS attacks are actually organized by</font>

139
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:46,899
crime syndicates where they're stealing

140
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,459
you know but well while the company's

141
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:51,309
playing whack-a-mole with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D dos</font>

142
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:52,779
they're stealing information you know

143
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,789
out the back door and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have different</font>

144
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,919
groups involved the hacktivists make a

145
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,989
great distraction for the the real

146
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,359
perpetrators who organized the<font color="#E5E5E5"> events</font>

147
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:06,638
and you know created the chaos that led

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,429
up to it so how does this break out as

149
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,069
far as the types of attackers that we

150
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:15,969
see who's doing what as you can see of

151
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:19,869
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as cyber crime most of it is or the</font>

152
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:21,610
origin of it is cyber crime but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

153
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:23,709
you consider how much is actually going

154
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,839
on behind the scenes I'd say more than

155
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:29,440
what is shown there is cybercrime this

156
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,060
is in as much as they can break it up

157
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,820
this is a really dated article but I

158
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,470
think it's funny it shows in 2009<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

159
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,390
countries that were preparing for war

160
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,850
right know that you've got the usual

161
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">suspects and then they got France France</font>

162
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,180
is involved France has never been

163
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,410
particularly well in a war so they're

164
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,100
they're throwing their hat in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cyber</font>

165
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,120
ring and I will see how they do that

166
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidences they've already</font>

167
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,980
surrendered but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

168
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:01,340
later so who are who are these hackers

169
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,780
what do they look like you know we we

170
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,460
deal a ton with China you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of course</font>

171
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mandiant report and the verizon</font>

172
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,000
report and there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reports</font>

173
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,130
out there but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have we have</font>

174
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,040
very sophisticated individuals involved

175
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:16,250
in an elaborate business collecting your

176
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,290
data now here's an example you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

177
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,150
the types of things and this is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

178
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,810
who's more organized the average I

179
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">teashop are these guys I mean these guys</font>

180
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,580
got their stuff together if you take a

181
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">look you know the Pentagon estimated</font>

182
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,669
that in 2011<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Chinese military</font>

183
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,229
spending equals 180 billion dollars with

184
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,680
really most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that being a sustained</font>

185
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:42,350
investment in cyber warfare tell me what

186
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,539
can you buy for a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eighty</font>

187
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,889
billion dollars

188
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,349
any you want right is there anything

189
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:54,610
anything not for sale for 180 billion

190
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:55,929
dollars you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think so and</font>

191
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,110
particularly if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a workforce</font>

192
00:07:55,929 --> 00:08:02,589
that works for an average wage of seven

193
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:06,459
dollars per week how far does your 180

194
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:10,029
billion dollars go my last stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

195
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:12,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody knows about the</font>

196
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:14,319
the Red October attack that was its

197
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:16,388
controversial as opposed to who did it I

198
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,019
mean you see a lot of Cyrillic

199
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,879
characters and the malware you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

200
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,339
you know that the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font>

201
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,080
service involved in it were in China<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

202
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,059
if you go back and you take a look at

203
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what actually happened you can</font>

204
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:30,399
you think about back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in two thousand</font>

205
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,620
seven what happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand</font>

206
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven you had rbn which is the Russian</font>

207
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,578
business Network that was formerly the

208
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:38,889
Russian hacking team they somehow fell

209
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:41,679
out of favor<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Russia and they</font>

210
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:44,439
basically took exile in China China said

211
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,120
hey you guys are welcome here and so the

212
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:47,740
same it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the same</font>

213
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,329
servers that are beyond used to use for

214
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,060
the same servers used to perpetrate Red

215
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:54,099
October and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same attack</font>

216
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,560
methodology it's just you basically have

217
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,860
a Chinese funded Russian hacker group

218
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,750
rbn in China perpetrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red October and</font>

219
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,829
it but everybody still is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I</font>

220
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,600
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's that sounds like a</font>

221
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,040
conspiracy you know but you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

222
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at all the places in red this is</font>

223
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,399
the place is known to be affected by by

224
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,160
Red October you know the attack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

225
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,350
is there a large country and Asia maybe

226
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,300
that wasn't affected that also<font color="#CCCCCC"> is known</font>

227
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,079
for hacking I'll just let the pictures

228
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,370
speak for itself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was an</font>

229
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,829
invasive attack I mean it's interesting

230
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,990
that every antivirus missed this for

231
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:32,689
over five years

232
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,820
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that say about any buyers I'll</font>

233
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,650
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what every anyway every company</font>

234
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that we view</font>

235
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,939
instant response we go out every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

236
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,949
every week every company has antivirus I

237
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,500
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell you that almost never</font>

238
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,420
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ever find anything we can we can</font>

239
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of kick it and get it going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

240
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,260
make some custom signature sport and and

241
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,510
and once we have some signatures will go

242
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,189
find just those there's some things you

243
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,530
can do to beef it up all that make it

244
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,360
and turn on heuristics but i'm not sure

245
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:04,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">what antivirus does anymore be perfectly</font>

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,920
honest just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a compliance check box so</font>

247
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,600
mantra so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> united states we have</font>

248
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">our own cyber army and i think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

249
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,690
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting it sounds a little</font>

250
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,390
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the army or so the the</font>

251
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,060
mantra for the the postal service and

252
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,360
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. cyber army will conduct</font>

of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the US government</font>

259
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,150
cyber army is attributed with with

260
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:41,480
Stuxnet and and it's kind of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

261
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,890
Stuxnet yet it made it so the the

262
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
centrifuges on the Iranian<font color="#CCCCCC"> nuclear</font>

263
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,790
facilities wouldn't spin at a constant

264
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,500
rate so you couldn't generate plutonium

265
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a stable way it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically</font>

266
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">screwed up the works which is kind of</font>

267
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:56,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool but the downside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of releasing that</font>

268
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,250
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware is that once it's out</font>

269
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,780
its out once that malware is in the

270
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,580
public space it can be used by anybody

271
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some really sophisticated</font>

272
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,510
derivatives that came from its that we

273
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,420
know we're basically involved in theft

274
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,640
of information and you know they were

275
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,839
adapted it pretty pretty significant

276
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,270
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> we even seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in some places</font>

277
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:20,750
where like flame for instance if you you

278
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,790
can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to infect air gap networks so</font>

279
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,550
this is particularly bad for skate in

280
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,410
networks we see this quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit where</font>

281
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,599
somebody goes to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> patches to an air</font>

that's just two sharks you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

308
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:28,579
the sea you know we we run across this

309
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:30,800
all the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're either goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Russia</font>

310
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,479
or it goes to China and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

311
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,130
have sort of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> methods</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

312
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,449
wind up having to adapt for you know if

<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever you know type of thing that</font>

314
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:43,969
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

315
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:46,250
seen on the rise<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that is that I</font>

316
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">think really a concern for the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

317
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,069
ransomware you know every place that we

318
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,779
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into has some level of malware we get</font>

319
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:55,579
brought in all the time where it says

320
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,980
yeah you know we have this malware

321
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:59,750
outbreak and we got it all cleaned up

322
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">for good but you know the executive</font>

323
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,199
management there there a little bit

324
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:05,509
uncertain and that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to have</font>

325
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,609
you come in and take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look verify we're</font>

326
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:09,259
good and we go and we're fine malware

327
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,790
all over the place it's now XD is being

328
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:12,800
ethical traded crazy stuffs going on

329
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,439
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just they're missing it but what</font>

330
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens when that malware turns into</font>

331
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:19,579
ransomware I mean the malware that we

332
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,500
have that we see out there there's it

333
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:23,300
can download anything it wants we see

334
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,420
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these big collaborations of malware</font>

335
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,399
things like oh like<font color="#E5E5E5"> W changed up 32 that</font>

336
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">always brings down Zeus or throw accent</font>

337
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,639
that brings now a bunch of other stuff

338
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,550
what happens when it starts bringing

339
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,290
down ransomware you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

340
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,120
kind of amazing stuff in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

341
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,040
it'll basically look for certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> types</font>

342
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,350
of drives on your system encrypt all

343
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,420
look for certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of data types in</font>

344
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,189
your system rather encrypt all the data

345
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that matches those types whether maybe</font>

346
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:51,740
it's office docs<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDFs xls any kind of</font>

347
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,809
database email what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if you know</font>

348
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,100
you're a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of your</font>

349
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:58,250
databases

350
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,930
now no documents all your work product

351
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,850
gets encrypted and then you got a

352
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,189
friendly sign like this thing you know

353
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,850
contact us it will give you the key how

354
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,740
much would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pay I think this is</font>

355
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the next evolution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of malware</font>

356
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,000
that we'll see out there now thats

357
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,209
become very good yet you know who Lisa

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,490
data theft so here's what we're seeing

359
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,340
with the statistics of you know the rise

360
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,960
of ransomware it's definitely increasing

361
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,940
and in my opinion it kind of went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

362
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,770
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alpha testing phase the</font>

363
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,380
beta testing phase they're testing it on

364
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:33,980
the home pc market at some point it'll

365
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:40,070
make its way into<font color="#E5E5E5"> big business and it's</font>

366
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:42,350
definitely something to think about now

367
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,760
the elder<font color="#CCCCCC"> wood group that this is a</font>

368
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,180
there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting paper that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

369
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,160
put out by<font color="#E5E5E5"> symantec lula last year I</font>

370
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,359
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the elder wood</font>

371
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,640
group and they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> following them</font>

372
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,410
for a while and these people probably

373
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,430
bother me more than anybody else if

374
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's anything that keeps me up at</font>

375
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,400
night<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's this sort of concept and</font>

376
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,930
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to cross these guys and</font>

377
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,880
what what we find is that the x-pipe

378
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,709
methods that they use they always seem

379
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,170
they have this endless supply of zero

380
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,790
day exploits right they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> never seem</font>

381
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run out and what's particularly</font>

382
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:16,599
fascinating about it is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> always seem</font>

383
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,160
to release new zero-day exploits as

384
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,480
their attack vectors about a month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

385
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">before a patch was released a month or</font>

386
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,370
so before a patch is released and so

387
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,660
that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happens once hey man</font>

388
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,580
they really got lucky well that was cool

389
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,170
but that happens consistently again and

390
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,870
again and again and again what is that

391
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,459
that's pattern right so how do they

392
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,490
always have this kind of insider

393
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,860
knowledge and so and so I mean you can

394
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,020
your mind if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of wander down I</font>

395
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,790
guess uncomfortable pass thinking about

396
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I mean it seems to me they have</font>

397
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,069
some sort of presence some of the big

398
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,420
software houses like Microsoft Adobe you

399
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,780
know companies like that you know that

400
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">can allow this</font>

401
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:23,929
it's just that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pattern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that we</font>

402
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,059
see it's true you can go either way with

403
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,199
it but the pattern that we see again and

404
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,059
again well there's always an endless

405
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,429
supply of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just in my</font>

406
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:32,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">opinion this is my opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just seems</font>

407
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:34,699
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and they always really said</font>

408
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:36,589
about a month before the patch is

409
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:38,029
released or they change their tech

410
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:39,559
Memphis about a month before the patches

411
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">which but has me concerned maybe we can</font>

412
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:45,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that offline sir talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

413
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:46,639
after the presentation it was by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

414
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,169
one of the last times I showed this

415
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,339
presentation somebody asked me if that

416
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:53,449
picture was real like yeah I haven't you

417
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,699
been to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zoo day they did a little</font>

418
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:57,049
time how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the zebra is going</font>

419
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:02,868
to eat the leaves on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tree</font>

420
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:04,579
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so of course I activist the you know</font>

421
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:06,620
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> interestingly as so we trace it</font>

422
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1989 is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the earliest</font>

423
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,579
instances of hacktivism if you know you

424
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,439
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really think about hacktivism</font>

425
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,510
happening in the 80s but you can follow

426
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">it back about as far as that if you</font>

427
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of a new</font>

428
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:21,638
manifestation of an old thing which is

429
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:25,250
civil disobedience but<font color="#E5E5E5"> often sort of</font>

430
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:26,839
manipulated by by higher level

431
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,620
organizations like I was talking about

432
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:34,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">nation states and crime syndicates</font>

433
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:36,080
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definition of hacktivism idea</font>

434
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,820
and I don't read it to you it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

435
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,699
little bit snooty anything that starts

436
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,779
off with a portmanteau is just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

437
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:47,840
too highfalutin to read but it's it's

438
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:50,149
sort of very trendy<font color="#CCCCCC"> avant garde makes</font>

439
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,299
the whole thing seem very cool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

440
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:56,268
when you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UH</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

441
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:57,740
unwitting collaboration between nation

442
00:17:56,269 --> 00:18:00,769
states and crime syndicates with the

443
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,279
hacktivists<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it definitely sort of</font>

444
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:07,820
takes away from the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> splendor of it</font>

445
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:09,980
in my opinion so here's how we see the

446
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,840
five main hacking groups you it really

447
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,720
is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the top of the food chain</font>

448
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,760
which is the cyber terrorists and the

449
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,559
nation states and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> meat</font>

450
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,970
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call neat bots which is other</font>

451
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,950
people who are basically organized

452
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,690
underneath them that provide a really

453
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,529
good distraction and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

454
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">levels of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those people</font>

455
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,669
what's it take to be a hacked well spell

456
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,740
is optional there's an interesting

457
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,450
attack that happened a while back there

458
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,790
was a hacker's target of the wrong

459
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,780
website they meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to target Cassie</font>

460
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:45,879

targeted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cassie muguara which is a</font>

463
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Regional Water District and so they shut</font>

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">down water for some farm folks out there</font>

465
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,030
was a big win for the activist last year

466
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:03,030
but they created chaos so they all went

467
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:05,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy so who's a target we hear time</font>

468
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,330
that I well no we're not a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

469
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,549
know we just make lasers I had somebody

470
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,678
say that to me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple months ago we</font>

471
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:15,460
just make lasers we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a target no</font>

472
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,860
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> cares so everybody's a target I mean</font>

473
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,470
in a world where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an enterprise</font>

474
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,899
operation and and the main the main

475
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,059
product that they're selling us is data

476
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,770
your data they're just collecting at

477
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,870
these data whether it's for an

478
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,190
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> its passwords</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for</font>

479
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that organization or its information</font>

480
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,620
it's a maybe you have there you're about

481
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,870
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invest in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your company but</font>

482
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,820
they want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how your oil wells are</font>

483
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,799
producing we've seen that before where

484
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,780
they they just they hacked in simply to

485
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,460
know what the flow rate was over the

486
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,530
wells before they did an investment and

487
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">they found out that the flow rate wasn't</font>

488
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,879
as the company purported and so they

489
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,520
didn't do the investment so there

490
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,570
there's virtually everybody's a target

491
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for multiple reasons whether</font>

492
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,470
they want your credit card information

493
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,360
or they just want your personal

494
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,250
information or they want the data that

495
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,250
you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something your passwords</font>

496
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,350
or they just want your your network to

497
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,090
be part of their botnets you have a

498
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,340
thousand node<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you sure make a</font>

499
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,020
nice botnet right you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a thousand</font>

500
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,370
node network with an OC 3 connection

501
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,809
they can use you for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of denial</font>

502
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of service there's there's almost</font>

503
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,350
there's on there's nobody out there

504
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,800
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you simply don't have an internet</font>

505
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,590
presence that is not a target

506
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,990
something else that we've seen two is as

507
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,990
jump points ever since the mandiant apt

508
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">one report was released that it changed</font>

509
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,190
it changed the way the attack methods

510
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,330
work now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't always expect to find</font>

511
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,830
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to Russia or China</font>

512
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,960
or somewhere other country it's bad

513
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:46,149
because open times they'll use networks

514
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,490
inside of the country or<font color="#CCCCCC"> grandma's XP</font>

515
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,470
box that's unpatch you know you know as

516
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,910
a jump point for command and control

517
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,410
because that way it doesn't like a

518
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:58,270
suspicious when you're looking at

519
00:20:53,410 --> 00:21:01,270
firewall logs really common which leads

520
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,889
into you know smaller smaller people

521
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">home people have smaller companies</font>

522
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,690
people lower down in the supply chain

523
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:09,700
they they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are much easier targets big</font>

524
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies are deep pockets like I showed</font>

525
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,530
in the first set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides they are not</font>

526
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,900
they are not able to adequately defend

527
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,580
themselves how much more able is a small

528
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,990
company going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to defend</font>

529
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean who's going to spend</font>

530
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:27,310
180 billion dollars depending nobody and

531
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:30,460
especially not a small company so here's

532
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:33,159
what we call the hacker ecosystem<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and</font>

533
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,780
it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their find a way in and</font>

534
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,950
they'll research information we see a

535
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff where the</font>

536
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,900
spearfishing type of attacks or wailing

537
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,280
type of attacks where it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

538
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,640
they'll they'll research you on LinkedIn

539
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean who here is not on linkedin right</font>

540
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,040
probably almost everybody has their

541
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:53,920
profile on linkedin and it you can do a

542
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,360
search for like database admin at IBM or

543
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I'm just using them as an</font>

544
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,620
example and you'll find a lot of

545
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,720
information on linkedin about you know

546
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,510
database information database admins for

547
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,310
IBM you can start giving them you know

548
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,690
targeted types of things maybe research

549
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,179
what that person's into maybe they're in

550
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,880
a jogging club they like biking whatever

551
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,560
frisbee and so you start sending them

552
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,790
typing the targeted type stuff to get

553
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,500
you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get them interested</font>

554
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,180
you get malware in their machine next

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted you harvested their data sucked</font>

it out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you have it available on</font>

information

<font color="#E5E5E5">that well it can count from any</font>

576
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:11,379
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thing about you know blocking</font>

577
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:13,359
syn floods and that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a</font>

578
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:15,340
small part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the larger problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

579
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,408
there are many many methods of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dido so</font>

580
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,389
so when when looking into an overall

581
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:21,369
dido solution there's there's a lot of

582
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:23,889
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that need to come and come to</font>

583
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:26,019
play in a thought process in order to to

584
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,488
adequately be able to address something

585
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,629
like that considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the variety of</font>

586
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,609
what we see out there and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

this is this was just one quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

last year and the maps always different

here's an example of the attack message

that what they call the tora tora tora

an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the tools that are</font>

596
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,980
called slow loris which is the tool used

00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,530
for attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache web servers and</font>

598
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,970
what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it uses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up connections</font>

one after the other after the other and

600
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,350
basically brings the Apache server to

601
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,510
its knees and does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a very very</font>

attack aside from the number of threads

604

it's using then on the bottom you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

folks who come to us you know with help

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,010
for ddos mitigation but that's that's

one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first things that we say is</font>

639
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,030
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not the big problem</font>

that's not the reason they're being d

641
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:39,040
das in the first place and so when you

come across<font color="#E5E5E5"> this situation be especially</font>

wary of what else is going on look at

the either you know look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the lines</font>

649
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,030
which sort of brings me to multi-vector

650
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,310
attacks which is really what we're

651
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,020
seeing now almost in every case even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

652
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,669
simplest types of intrusions that we're

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,170
seeing out there credit card theft of

654
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,390
grocery stores things of that nature

655
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:14,120
they start their start with multi-vector

656
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:16,580
attacks there's situations where we see

657
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,590
maybe a couple months ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time of</font>

658
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,360
an attack we'll see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big malware</font>

659
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,830
outbreak within an organization and

660
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,449
they'll be struggling to keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

661
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,419
this malware outbreak and it's something

662
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:29,690
maybe an example was w<font color="#CCCCCC"> changeup 32 came</font>

663
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,460
in and it's a and it hit all the files

664
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,500
on the file server so people you know

665
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,210
they freaked out about that meanwhile

666
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">zeus got pulled down and started x-trail</font>

any kind of thing it could find and

669
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,920
sending this data out they spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

672
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,470
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleaned up and then</font>

673
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything seemed fine then not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

674
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:55,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they suffered your courage</font>

675
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,900
we're using passwords that were

676
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:01,310
collected during the original malware

677
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:03,890
infection the that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to steal</font>

upload malware things of that nature and

681
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,929
so you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this very strategic no type</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks that's planned out over a</font>

long period of time and executed in a

684
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,370
very professional manner and we see it

685
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,630
like i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier across waves of</font>

686

different types of retail stores and

689
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,400
you'll see just hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> them one after the</font>

other after the other after the other

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,210
why not they developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for one they</font>

692
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,090
can use it for many you know their their

693
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:39,320
software developers and they they put it

694
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to good use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proper wise so what's it</font>

695
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,050
take to defend this kind of stuff and

696
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,940
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks you know are out</font>

697
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,440
there's there's a ton and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you take a</font>

699
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,970
can require you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in-depth people to</font>

be able to understand how to how to

prevent and how to add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mini mediate</font>

702
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,730
how do you respond there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

703
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,400
large team and I'll hire people to

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:04,250
basically who are specialists in certain

705
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">know types of areas and then they'll</font>

706
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,960
kind of overlap with others but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and</font>

I have a nationwide reach I mean I'm

hiring you know right

709
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,429
now and it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to hire people</font>

712
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,290
more difficult is it for for companies

could buy it seventeen hundred bucks now

grandma you know works every time but

732
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,690
very advanced stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of amazing</font>

733
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,330
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start digging into the</font>

734
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,120
interfaces and what they do because

735
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,730
you'll get a you know point-and-click

736
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,649
evasion polymorphism and and really

737
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the worst thing that that made</font>

738
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,520
that stepped up the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe over the</font>

739
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">last six months is what we're finding is</font>

740
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,170
malware is polymorphic per machine used

741
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,629
to be polymorphic malware was

742
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,460
polymorphic /<font color="#E5E5E5"> environments right so for</font>

743
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,410
instance you know company a had had

744
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,750
basically had different malware than

745
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">company b but within the organization it</font>

746
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,110
usually had the same hash and was easy

747
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,760
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find the same signature that's not</font>

748
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the case anymore it will have a</font>

749
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,879
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> name a different hash you know</font>

750
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,290
the mutex is different the sizes

751
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,970
difference it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have something</font>

752
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:49,340
between like a 1.5 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 kilobyte</font>

753
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">variance in size because of some random</font>

754
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:56,000
you text it just gets fired into it and

755
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,590
so on the instant response side we've

756
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,230
had to really step up our game and

757
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,909
develop entirely new methodologies in

758
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,890
order to combat that because the the old

759
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,210
school friends at concepts of well we

760
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,860
have a hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the malware we're going</font>

761
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,549
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> find this else right now that hash</font>

762
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,729
will find that malware on one box

763
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,840
and that's it and so there's some some

764
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,639
companies that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

765
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:21,820
to sort of to basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance the</font>

766
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:24,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology into a way to to to be able</font>

767
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to detect or to investigate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and detect</font>

768
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,509
those types of things one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them is</font>

769
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:32,199
fire amp we work with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys in</font>

770
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:35,259
there they're very helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us here's</font>

771
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,669
an example of the DIY interface types of

772
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:40,210
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has it has like enable</font>

773
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:43,359
spreaders enable anti detection you know

774
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:46,359
it's a persistence it just has it has a

775
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,399
ton of different features in it and then

776
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,119
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evasion or</font>

777
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">counter-attacks so let's say you're</font>

778
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,189
investigating it you're investigating no

779
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:57,039
packet captures using wireshark it has

780
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,950
it has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in that if it's opened in</font>

781
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,299
wireshark that if the packet is

782
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,279
investigating Wireshark there's a

783
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:07,269
possibility that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could infect the</font>

784
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,769
investigator machine even<font color="#CCCCCC"> San boxing's</font>

785
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,450
in there if you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> sandboxie it</font>

786
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,919
has sandboxie circumvention so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get</font>

787
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,690
out so you can basically just click

788
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,210
click click click click enable each one

789
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,440
of these things and you have point and

790
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,419
click advanced malware there's even a

791
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">Help button right you can you can click</font>

00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:27,939
something you expect support right and

795
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:34,179
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that as an option they're</font>

796
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:35,889
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you literally so apt you see</font>

797
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:39,549
that standing on a laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

798
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:40,689
you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble actually found one of</font>

799
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:45,309
those of salt lake<font color="#E5E5E5"> airport I'm going to</font>

800
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:47,619
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the way back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through but we're</font>

801
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,539
finding a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> apt with organizations</font>

802
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:51,279
and not everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is apt but but when</font>

803
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:52,899
you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's it's it's usually</font>

804
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,879
distinct / organization and

805
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:56,830
interestingly you'll find like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

806
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,389
organization name embedded in text

807
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">oftentimes in it so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

808
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:01,539
customized for that organization it's

809
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,158
kind of fascinating some of the stuff

810
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:09,389
they do and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always that way but</font>

811
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:12,429
we see we see a ton of that there it's a

812
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:14,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very very pervasive usually it goes</font>

813
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:17,320
after you know government<font color="#E5E5E5"> sector type</font>

814
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,389
stuff engineering type plans and in

815
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">often</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times they'll have moles in those</font>

816
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:21,699
organizations we even found places a

817
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:23,500
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

818
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,510
this is where there's employees who are

819
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,740
working there who who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

820
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:31,990
employees of the company but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

821
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:36,190
also employees of somebody else so what

822
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:37,929
attack vectors so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they're</font>

823
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,399
the type of attack vectors will they

824
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:41,169
take to get into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

825
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:43,629
the answer is any anyone they need to

826
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:45,970
know they will be as advanced in their

827
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,500
game as they need to to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

828
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization I mean there's situations</font>

829
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,490
where like they hack the Chinese

830
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,429
restaurant<font color="#E5E5E5"> down street from the secure</font>

831
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,080
company and hack the website so anyone

832
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:58,330
who goes to order you know Chinese chow

833
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,039
mein<font color="#CCCCCC"> know from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the website no gets</font>

834
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,990
infected by a water hole attack they'll

835
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,990
even send out a coupon or something for

836
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,519
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-dollar chow mein today you know</font>

837
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:11,649
so it should direct you to that website

838
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:14,080
and so they're helpful in that regard so

839
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:15,850
what it look like from a development

840
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,070
perspective so what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

841
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:21,580
fascinating is is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

842
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically a flow chart of how a process</font>

843
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,210
flow of how the how the malware calls

844
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,918
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different modules within the</font>

845
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,840
code and let me see that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like any</font>

846
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:29,950
other type of software development map

847
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see of any professional</font>

848
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:35,380
organization except for the modules that

849
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,330
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using their vulnerabilities</font>

850
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,649
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> CVEs out there so if they</font>

851
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,760
don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in through this one they use</font>

852
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one if that one doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

853
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,908
they'll use one of these other ones they

854
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:44,590
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for everybody and so if</font>

855
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:46,360
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these different</font>

856
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,428
things that people have installed on the

857
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,100

this this malware

872
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:37,210
and this is happening like for instance

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,769
spear phishing attacks if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

that on the weekend you guys aren't

00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,889
watching your machines right you're not

somebody saw like a mouse move or

00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:12,609
something weird happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> even one time</font>

890
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,799
antivirus found it but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

893
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,940
we're also seeing a big uptick in

companies finally realizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hey you</font>

898
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,189
of when we get hacked and so in our in

899
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,989
our pipeline if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sales</font>

type stuff where they want policies

908
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,759
know some sort of sequel injection

909
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,558
here's here's how i would do incident

910
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:50,249
response and basically it's a playbook

911
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:54,900
for maybe knock tenders and scenarios

912
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:54,899
that that folks are interested in

913
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:04,130
so covered most of this so how what's

914
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,770
the state of the enterprise and and how

915
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,170
companies are responding you know it's

916
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,640
right now it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fair fight you have</font>

917
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">a hundred eighty billion dollars versus</font>

918
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,810
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller probably the single</font>

919
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,310
biggest problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're still seeing</font>

920
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,078
on the same problems that that we've

921
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">been seeing for the last decade which is</font>

922
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,609
third party patch management everybody's

923
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,869
a wsus server and passion windows that's

924
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,299
not the problem or<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows automatic</font>

925
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:32,089
updates are on so what it's all the

926
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,369
third party applications that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

927
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,779
get patched and nobody patches<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java like</font>

928
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:38,359
every three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours whatever you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

929
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:42,740
patch<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java these days and so you know</font>

930
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:44,480
flash<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java is silver lights a quick time</font>

931
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,750
you know all these little things<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

932
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,160
any controls over these types of things

933
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:52,040
and so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a constant source of</font>

934
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,890
folks being able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an attack the</font>

935
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,259
the other side of the coin is that

936
00:36:53,890 --> 00:37:00,170
security never is able to keep up with

937
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:04,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the advancements in IT so we see a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

938
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:06,200
of advancements in WEP html5 and Ajax

939
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:09,380
and Silverlight but but never our

940
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:12,230
security scanners or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to lock</font>

941
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:17,119
it down able to keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so</font>

942
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:18,680
so very frequently we see we see

943
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,900
problems like this so this this is an

944
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,060
instance where we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Best of Breed</font>

945
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,530
security scanners out there and I'm not

946
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to name any names and then we had</font>

947
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:30,109
manual testers from from our appt<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC</font>

948
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:32,359
team and we coded up a box<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had 17</font>

949
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:33,770
different vulnerabilities that we put

950
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:37,250
into it if you take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

951
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:40,579
performance of the scanners found kind

952
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,200
of found four out of 17 of the extant

953
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:43,550
vulnerabilities that were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but the</font>

954
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,770
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are used in scanners you know</font>

955
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:47,119
they generally have a sense of false

956
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:50,000
sense of security that hey I use the

957
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,040
scanner and it kicks ass you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you</font>

958
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,660
know I my server came back clean I'm

959
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,020
good to go i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> publish this code</font>

960
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,359
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much the the security testing</font>

961
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,520
team we had they didn't find all 17 they

962
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,520
got 16 out of 17 which is you know

963
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,770
pretty good but the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is the</font>

964
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">highlight from this is that</font>

965
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:11,620
you know what we have now<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't isn't</font>

966
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:15,790
you know providing a full sense of

967
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:18,819
security now this screen is a screenshot

968
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">from black hole and it shows machines</font>

969
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,730
that particular instance of black hole

970
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,350
this screenshot shows how they got in

971
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,960
and then I did a basically a blow-up of

972
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:31,450
it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was responsible for about 90</font>

973
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,100
something percent of the attacks that

974
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">were successful and how they were able</font>

975
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> own it and I mean who out there</font>

976
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,580
anybody have any like have to have

977
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">old-school Java which is part legacy</font>

978
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,830
applications right everybody I mean

979
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,020
common problem everybody has that

980
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,930
problem and if job is not updated to the

981
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,190
latest and even if it is it's a it's a

982
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,049
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge problem I think they should</font>

983
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,480
reclassify job as a back door and

984
00:38:53,050 --> 00:39:00,880
antivirus should delete it that's that's

985
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:03,280
something we can do with antivirus so so

986
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,340
state of the enterprise something that

987
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,540
we see a lot is is a security through

988
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,580
compliance security drive compliance

989
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,800
drives most of the security initiatives

990
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,450
that we see out there in the market no

991
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,830
you have to have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> viruses a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checkbox</font>

992
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:21,310
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have this as a checkbox</font>

993
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:25,840
right but if your if your compliance are

994
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:27,549
you secure no but if you're secure are

995
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,740
you probably compliance unless you're

996
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:33,190
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Germany or or you know</font>

997
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:35,140
Great Britain yeah if you're secure

998
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,910
you're probably compliant so we've got

999
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,390
to flip that around you know manage

1000
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:43,359
manage compliance through security not

1001
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:45,819
the other way around european countries

1002
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,050
accepted another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see is</font>

1003
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people get a lot of</font>

1004
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,410
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get all these different</font>

1005
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,030
tools you know they're cutting loose

1006
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,890
with a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a lot</font>

1007
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">of tools out there but for one then up</font>

1008
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,950
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly configured they're</font>

1009
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,990
not integrated it's just another thing

1010
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at right a security till just</font>

1011
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,379
becomes one more thing to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

1012
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,149
doesn't solve a problem in an automated

1013
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,770
way and so something that we frequently

1014
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,330
do anything response engagements as well

1015
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,950
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and will basically integrate</font>

1016
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,870
these tools will turn on features will

1017
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,279
get stuff reacting right away or you

1018
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately in an automated fashion</font>

1019
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,160
so people don't have to actually click a

1020
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:19,300
button<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it happen and and and get</font>

1021
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">things working and then we can basically</font>

1022
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:26,860
take back an organization through the

1023
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:28,510
existing tool sets that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have but</font>

1024
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,610
nobody's in the business of being hacked

1025
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,750
right is that anybody's business model

1026
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,450
in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> well here's in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the business of</font>

1027
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,770
being hacked right and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1028
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,180
there's some customers that we've seen

1029
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,210
who maybe they<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> classified as</font>

1030
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,620
that but but it's not is obviously

1031
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,810
nobody's main line of<font color="#E5E5E5"> business however</font>

1032
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,640
on my team<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's that's what we do all</font>

1033
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,250
day long right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do instant response</font>

1034
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,259
all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> long we see we see wide swathes</font>

1035
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">no across every different you know type</font>

1036
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,410
of organization out there who see what

1037
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,690
works what doesn't and so it helps to

1038
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,069
work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the professional who doesn't</font>

1039
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,900
visit all the time and congrat

1040
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,900
assistance for your particular situation

1041
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,770
another problem obviously is is the

1042
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:09,100
perimeter where is the perimeter anymore

1043
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:12,040
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean anybody have data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1044
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,170
cloud right probably everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has data</font>

1045
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:19,750
in the cloud in some way whether it's

1046
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:21,040
your gmail or something Google Drive the

1047
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,360
biggest problems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing out</font>

1048
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,759
there though we've seen a lot of cloud

1049
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,040
packs and clouds have really good what I

1050
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,480
call front door security oh I better

1051
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,009
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapped this up I got five</font>

1052
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,750
minutes left clouds have really good

1053
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,520
front door security where they're good

1054
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:36,160
at keeping people good people out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1055
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people's stuff but if you're going</font>

1056
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,430
to use the cloud make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1057
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:42,430
everything you put in there is encrypted

1058
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,690
or you don't mind it getting stolen all

1059
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:49,180
right I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta zoom through some of this</font>

1060
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:51,700
stuff here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so incident management</font>

1061
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,100
frameworks one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will do</font>

1062
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:57,310
when we walk into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an organization almost</font>

1063
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,900
no matter what type of incident response

1064
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,640
type back table you were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

1065
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,720
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization and what</font>

1066
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,250
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing within the incident</font>

1067
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,990
management framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1068
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to identify hacks</font>

1069
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:09,250
and and most companies don't they don't

1070
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to identify if they've</font>

1071
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,580
actually been then been attacked and

1072
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,650
then move on through the rest of the

1073
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,270
steps within its you know communication

1074
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,700
collection of information analysis

1075
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:21,100
containments all the way down to

1076
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,319
policies procedures playbooks you know

1077
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,360
and in training does your team have the

1078
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,160
appropriate training these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> definite</font>

1079
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,460
things that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on in</font>

1080
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,500
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help companies be able</font>

1081
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,630
best defend themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their</font>

1082
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,650
networks and protect the security of

1083
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:38,660
their customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's an example of</font>

1084
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,000
some of the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use when we go</font>

1085
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,170
on site and I'm vendor-neutral I don't I

1086
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,880
don't make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> money off of selling</font>

1087
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,560
products I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I just like</font>

1088
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,099
products at work and I have

1089
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationships with about 140 something</font>

1090
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,400
different companies that we have

1091
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,859
partnerships with and so I can use any

1092
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,720
tool I want and so I'll generally work

1093
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:58,580
with with these different companies and

1094
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">use just sort of pick and choose</font>

1095
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">best-of-breed products from different</font>

1096
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,000
companies kind of a common suite of

1097
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:07,430
tools i'm using these days it's either a

1098
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,290
combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fire amp which i think</font>

1099
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,848
is the neatest cool in the world it's

1100
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coolest thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if i ever used</font>

1101
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:15,020
for instant response because it gives me

1102
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,630
so many answers so quickly and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

1103
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,220
lead with basically after<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

1104
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,930
analysis to figure out what nodes are

1105
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,209
affected we'll throw a fire amp in those

1106
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,740
boxes and find out what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on then</font>

1107
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,210
we'll jump in and do a deep dive

1108
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,450
investigation with something like in

1109
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:32,830
case enterprise or ftk enterprise and

1110
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:36,770
handle or mediation with that as well

1111
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:39,410
and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an expedited</font>

1112
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,150
workflow that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed because we</font>

1113
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,500
get so many attacks coming through we

1114
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,880
just can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a lot of time on it</font>

1115
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,890
we've actually been able to reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1116
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,900
response time in some cases where it

1117
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,970
started out using traditional instant

1118
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,099
response methodology to about from about

1119
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,098
three weeks in time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I reduced it to</font>

1120
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:57,410
16 hours on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> occasion to similar</font>

1121
00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:00,470
sized companies both had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5000 nodes same</font>

1122
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:03,049
malware same security team just

1123
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,549
different tool sets and and and maybe

1124
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,200
one had a little faster response time

1125
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,990
and getting our agents out there one

1126
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,919
took about three weeks which which you

1127
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,118
know because we had a hard time getting

1128
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,099
our agents out and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some stuff</font>

1129
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,869
done and then but that was with

1130
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,280
traditional forensics approaches and the

1131
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:19,280
other one took 16 hours and just

1132
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,460
mitigated it a place was clean so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

1133
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,440
a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an awesome study I have one of</font>

1134
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">my guys working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a white paper or case</font>

1135
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,380
study for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think my time is about</font>

1136
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:31,950
up I want to thank your thing thank you
