1
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:26,160
so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is dan huynh I work with VCU</font>

2
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,900
and that's a day I'll talk to you guys a

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,670
little bit about them a couple of

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,369
disclaimers so I'm not here to tell you

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,940
what does it get similar or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,559
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only from my personal experience</font>

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,690
experience of one organization that is

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,760
awesome implementation I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,000
you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the lessons I learned</font>

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,989
and you know whether you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,120
similar or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean don't let me</font>

12
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,750
persuade you I'm only sharing the

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,330
information with you also if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me</font>

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,350
over overly complex complex technical

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,440
questions I probably will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this talk is really</font>

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,269
based on the management track and how

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">simpkins have time to general risk and</font>

19
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:07,230
security management framework so without

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,789
further ado let's go ahead and get

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,480
started I think so still got a couple

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,440
people coming in so a little bit about

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,970
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I working it4 about about 15 years</font>

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,470
working pretty much all aspects of IT

25
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,770
and ended up in management so I work

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,650
primarily a<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> education setting</font>

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,210
and I got some minimal background in

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,310
some financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> institutions that doing</font>

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,130
application development for them served

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,730
served<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in VCU as the security</font>

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">officer for the past two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years and I</font>

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,750
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start well those of you have</font>

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,400
heard my presentations before knows that

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,800
I usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts with a start with a</font>

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,300
story but since today we're kind of

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">struggled by the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not gonna you</font>

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,250
know tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys a story so we'll just</font>

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,690
art with the quote the greatest enemy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,000
knowledge is not ignorance for the

40
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:00,470
illusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge came from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve</font>

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,850
signal Hawking so what does that mean

42
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,110
when I first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started working information</font>

43
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,940
security and I mean that's that's I

44
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,150
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew a lot you know yes I</font>

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,950
liked hacking I things you know i like

46
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,690
how to exploit vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font>

47
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,399
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was what what security is all about</font>

48
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,030
and you know illusion of knowledge

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,709
really what I what I have so at first

50
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,720
you know we're looking at individual

51
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,640
server logs you know take taking taking

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,489
a snippet you know try and try to do

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,929
some log monitoring manually looking

54
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at certain things and you know</font>

55
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,210
here and there we find a couple couple

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,109
of

57
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,100
exploit attempt whether they are

58
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful or not I mean sometimes</font>

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're successful sometimes there are</font>

60
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,830
not and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we thought were</font>

61
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,309
relatively see it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a secure and you</font>

62
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">know another another mentality I had</font>

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">before was that you know hey we know you</font>

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,870
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not a three-letter</font>

65
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,489
agency and who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our data and</font>

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,510
I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of upper management folks</font>

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,030
will share the same type of mentality

68
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,010
you know even even talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

69
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">our folks I mean they they still still</font>

70
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,019
think the same way but I think the more

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,829
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the more the more paranoid you</font>

72
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,330
get I guess but anyway so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

73
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,550
know our environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had no</font>

74
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">metric to track our results so what</font>

75
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,200
another ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening was you know</font>

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,200
we implemented a whole bunch of controls

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,329
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> no metrics with really no solid</font>

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,500
understanding of our environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

79
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,570
got a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pissed-off users</font>

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,070
and a security control that looks

81
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Council the security mom that look</font>

82
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:31,049
someone like this right so anyway so

83
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,519
then I grew up and realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

84
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were just nothing about ostriches</font>

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:40,290
with our heading in the sand and I asked

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,440
myself a question so do i wake up and

87
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:47,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">smell the roses or do I you know keep my</font>

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,630
head in the sand so I decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wake up</font>

89
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,370
get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sand and to really to</font>

90
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,769
obtain a knowledge of my my environment

91
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,720
I have to understand my<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment as a</font>

92
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:02,190
whole so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we started looking at said</font>

93
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,480
here are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sim vendors are for</font>

94
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">those of you who are not aware i'm sure</font>

95
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,140
most people would already know this but

96
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:11,430
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the sim system I'm the racist</font>

97
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,769
question to you guys give me your

98
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,980
definition of the system system yeah go

99
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,979
for it

100
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:36,389
okay yep yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right right right so</font>

101
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,440
correlation correlation is a huge piece

102
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,330
of sin so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some common</font>

103
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,040
misconceptions you know all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

104
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,020
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> information event management</font>

105
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,410
system it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really manage security</font>

106
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,030
for you so you can't really you know

107
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,560
just kick your feet up and relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

108
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,159
it's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a not a</font>

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,780
plug-and-play system it doesn't

110
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,310
necessarily reduce the amount of staff

111
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,320
or resources needed to manage security

112
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,850
which is another misconception and say

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,650
well you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're correlating all</font>

114
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,940
of this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> our system is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

115
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,770
telling us you know what the hell fences

116
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,020
are and hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what maybe we don't</font>

117
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,820
need need people to go go out and

118
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,750
accorded those those type of things and

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,990
that's not true computers running low

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,910
slow okay it definitely cannot be

121
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,070
implemented overnight as a matter of

122
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,650
fact it can be implemented over several

123
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,150
nights probably can't really be fully

124
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,049
implemented over a year depending on how

125
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,760
much resources you throw at it and I'll

126
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">go I'll go a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more into detail</font>

127
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,880
about that certainly not cheap and it

128
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,469
won't wash your car make you coffee I

129
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,419
know I know I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> disappointed</font>

130
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:50,130
when I found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that so so what</font>

131
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,229
kind of system system to foreign

132
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,780
organization so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can provide an</font>

133
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,370
organization with a visibility into its

134
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,020
IT environments so if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

135
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,590
have the knowledge of the organization

136
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,139
know what what you are dealing with

137
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,109
having this system can really tell you

138
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the threat landscape and correlate</font>

139
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,979
that to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-year to your assets</font>

140
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,160
right so so that's that I found to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

141
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,570
extremely helpful it does provide the

142
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,340
analytical horsepower to correlate

143
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:22,560
identify an alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> on security issues but</font>

144
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,210
note it only provides an analytical

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,780
horsepower it doesn't provide you with

146
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,599
an analyst so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need a</font>

147
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,580
data person you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody who can</font>

148
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,880
who can massage that data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and really get</font>

149
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,120
the the meaningful information out of it

150
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,340
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to really utilize</font>

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,470
it can be used as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a central Central log</font>

152
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,489
management system although personally

153
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,110
our experience we found that using the

154
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,520
same as a central log management system

155
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">is very costly and we we have a</font>

156
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,650
architect of the separate system for

157
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,610
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you the architecture</font>

158
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,500
in a little bit it does provide some

159
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:07,030
compliance testing and reporting across

160
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:09,070
multiple systems and also eliminate some

161
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,510
of the white noises if you tune it

162
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:16,450
correctly right so what do we use in

163
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,880
what do we see you use them so some of

164
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,950
the some of the original concepts were

165
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,020
one we want to understand our

166
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,070
environments have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the visibility we want</font>

167
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,010
to be able to collect meaningful metrics

168
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,409
and use the metrics to help us justify

169
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,730
our operations as well as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

170
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,280
possibly get more resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things</font>

171
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,900
like that right you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prioritize</font>

172
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,679
your threats against the organization

173
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,140
and against your a higher classified

174
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,729
assets and then enable the<font color="#E5E5E5"> share sharing</font>

175
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:48,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">of threat intelligence without trusted</font>

176
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:50,050
parties so here our business needs you

177
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,780
know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need more visibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

178
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">already kind of went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this and we</font>

179
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,619
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed a central log management</font>

180
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,600
tool at the time of our purchase

181
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,400
eventually we found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the same is</font>

182
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">not a good option for that so here are</font>

183
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of our evaluation requirements and</font>

184
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,590
if you if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at a sim</font>

185
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,180
solution you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

186
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,099
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these I mean they may not be</font>

187
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete they may not finish your</font>

188
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,550
organization but I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take a</font>

189
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:23,080
note of some of these items so one we

190
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to make sure that it can correlate</font>

191
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,650
data from RL tap network network

192
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,370
equipment servers and security

193
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,370
appliances and we can also collect

194
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,820
NetFlow data from our network appliances

195
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,310
right it has to maintain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

196
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,800
for at least 30 days for correlation

197
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,589
analysis and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

198
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,359
maintaining information for a medium to

199
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:49,559
large-sized enterprise like this you

200
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,029
also have to think about storage so

201
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,920
you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to define</font>

202
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:57,329
severity of events and alert on those

203
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,729
that meet the certain severity and

204
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,959
because if you if you just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

205
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,279
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tree out every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single event</font>

206
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no way you'll have enough</font>

207
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,009
resources to go and do that so you have

208
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,999
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to prioritize you must have</font>

209
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,290
and we thought that we must have a

210
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:15,279
search and query capabilities that can

211
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:19,059
allow us to really look at events that

212
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,370
relates to a particular incident you

213
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">know for forensic Kate of forensic</font>

214
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,050
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> and analysis and things like</font>

215
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,399
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also have to provide the</font>

216
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,899
ability for analysts equipped to drill

217
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,350
down from<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level to nitty gritty</font>

218
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:36,100
details and finally cannot eat up all of

219
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:41,019
our budget which were somewhat

220
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,639
successful at quetta<font color="#E5E5E5"> + C so compliance</font>

221
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,189
requirements in terms of the data

222
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:49,709
retention the state agencies such as a

223
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:52,389
VCU I actually have to abide by the

224
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:54,609
state the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> of virginia which is a</font>

225
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:57,220
say law and there are some record

226
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,589
retention requirements so we have to

227
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,519
retain certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> typing information for</font>

228
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:05,050
you know up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to three years and</font>

229
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,779
visibility requirements that again I'm

230
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:12,219
just mention all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font>

231
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:13,870
ended up with with all of those with all

232
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,019
of those elements consider that I think

233
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,749
we ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up choosing q radar from q1</font>

234
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,709
labs and now is IBM they were the best

235
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:25,779
value for us based on those criteria and

236
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,459
here's our<font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture design so again</font>

237
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,870
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send for collection</font>

238
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,329
and correlation of critical servers and

239
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,309
network security<font color="#E5E5E5"> vice logs and also we</font>

240
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,979
near the syslog server for the

241
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">collection of sis logs because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

242
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,269
that in if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the sim to</font>

243
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,429
collect events there are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

244
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,829
there's actually a cause the step<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

245
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,870
associated with that so based on the

246
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:52,719
event events per second that you want to

247
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:57,760
you want the sim to handle you will have

248
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,320
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay a certain amount and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dollar</font>

249
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,010
amount is relatively high in<font color="#E5E5E5"> comparison</font>

250
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,720
to a syslog server with some sand stores

251
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,370
tied to the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and back end of it so</font>

252
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,790
maintenance maintenance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the logs is</font>

253
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,380
that were actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the retention of logs</font>

254
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,099
actually made a lot of a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more sense</font>

255
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,560
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stored it in the syslog</font>

256
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,510
servers and then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the long</font>

257
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,949
long term storage at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three year plus</font>

258
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,680
storage which is went ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> archive</font>

259
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">into tape and that saved us quite a bit</font>

260
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of money versus using this based storage</font>

261
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,690
so here's a architectural diagram of our

262
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:37,089
semi architecture if you take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

263
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:38,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">it we have so first of all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

264
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">university we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we ended up</font>

265
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:44,350
classifying our assets based on the

266
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">asset sensitivity and again that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font>

267
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,760
know tied to the CIA triangle so we have

268
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
category<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 servers which are most</font>

269
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:55,510
sensitive servers category 2 and then

270
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,910
category 3 are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically 12</font>

271
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,740
steps below the category 1 respectively

272
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,469
with category 3 being pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

273
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,430
PAP servers that are handling public

274
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,589
information so<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see the logs</font>

275
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,709
are being fed through the syslog server

276
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,500
and the tape tape<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup and tape and</font>

277
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:16,689
then fed to the tape archive for all

278
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,640
three categories of servers the category

279
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">one servers are also going into the sim</font>

280
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:25,120
law collector for<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correlation</font>

281
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,400
and if you if you take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some of</font>

282
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,800
the ldap servers the ACP firewall and AD

283
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,199
and all those type of things they oh

284
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,390
they all go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the same as well so</font>

285
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:40,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty simple setup and it was</font>

286
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:40,110
effective for what it's worth yep

287
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,790
the two and three are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

288
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,600
sim yes their logs are only archived

289
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,430
their logs are going to the syslog

290
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,440
servers and then is being archived

291
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,370
because of the because the compliance

292
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,370
requirements now

293
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:07,690
yeah so that's that's our internal data

294
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,660
classification scheme so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

295
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:14,470
looked at the assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are used to</font>

296
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:16,150
handle the most sensitive data so so

297
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,120
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the asset provisioning</font>

298
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:23,079
works here is that before<font color="#CCCCCC"> any asset is</font>

299
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,460
provisioned down the data center the the

300
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,070
asset owner will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up filling</font>

301
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,810
a will have to complete a system

302
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,400
security plan and a secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plan will</font>

303
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:34,900
say hey you know tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

304
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,569
data this the system will<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle and you</font>

305
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,410
know who who's gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected by the</font>

306
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:43,150
system right so who<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the system</font>

307
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,160
that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right so you each</font>

308
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the assets and and creating that</font>

309
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,319
Liz is like pulling teeth but eventually

310
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,060
we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> classify all of our</font>

311
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,140
assets and then it and it so it took up

312
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,140
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little while first to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

313
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,290
yeah that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece we're still</font>

314
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,240
struggling with but if you do certify

315
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,579
that as a as a category<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

316
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,560
system you pretty much have to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

317
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:32,439
sign in blood to say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I will</font>

318
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,819
certify this and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

319
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,860
people are made aware of the

320
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:37,300
consequences you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do</font>

321
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,509
if you do miss misclassified

322
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,099
intentionally misclassify this your

323
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:48,339
systems then yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're gonna</font>

324
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">be on the hook so no not at this point</font>

325
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:54,670
we did as at one point run I didn't find

326
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,199
her and you know the spider and all

327
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,969
those other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to look for</font>

328
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:01,089
justice Souter screen numbers and those

329
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,500
those have the data but we we haven't we

330
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,810
haven't ran search tool for a little

331
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,939
while so but but yeah I mean right right

332
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:11,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">now is a lot a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this base on the</font>

333
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:13,599
honor system so whether there are people

334
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are misclassifying things I'm sure</font>

335
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,240
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I had I'm fairly confident</font>

336
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:23,439
that we do have most of our most

337
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:28,420
critical assets protected under category

338
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">one so but good question about and feel</font>

339
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,589
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask me any questions while I'm</font>

340
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,589
presenting so yeah

341
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,280
pulling back pulling<font color="#CCCCCC"> daily back from</font>

342
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,620
from tape yet bat back from the tape

343
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,079
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more difficult than</font>

344
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:00,810
pulling it directly from<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk but yes it</font>

345
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,860
it is possible yeah well I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

346
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data from two years ago like</font>

347
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,540
authentic agent data right so yeah it is

348
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,440
possible we can we can get that but I

349
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean it's not as not let me</font>

350
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:17,220
instantaneous so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll require resource</font>

351
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:22,800
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that works this is just</font>

352
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:24,750
all VCU right now yeah so we we we

353
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,270
haven't we haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a real</font>

354
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,040
discussion on what to do with a MCD and

355
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,210
on on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know that VCU</font>

356
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,360
health systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean they're their own</font>

357
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,460
separate legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity so is yeah there's</font>

358
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,450
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit difference there</font>

359
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,770
yep anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so here's our</font>

360
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,440
current current implementation we have a

361
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,569
management console we have a flow

362
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,610
collector for a net flow information and

363
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,700
we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> event log collector for the</font>

364
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:54,240
event information so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing</font>

365
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,250
right now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we've been tuning out a</font>

366
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,240
lot of white noise that we're seeing a

367
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:01,530
neural networks and we're right now

368
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,270
we're still seeing about a thousand to

369
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,569
two thousand the correlated<font color="#CCCCCC"> offices per</font>

370
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,180
week and keep in mind our security team

371
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:13,438
consists of four<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and we have two</font>

372
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:16,610
thousand events per week<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how do</font>

373
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,040
you deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that i don't know but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

374
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,119
have i have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple ideas and there is</font>

375
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,188
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and</font>

376
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,810
i will share that a little bit but so at

377
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,210
the other current log and flow volume

378
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,980
we're seeing about uranium are<font color="#CCCCCC"> immersing</font>

379
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">about average of about 2,000 events per</font>

380
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,200
second and at peak times we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see over</font>

381
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,260
10,000 events per second coming from the

382
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,020
servers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp servers in the dhcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

383
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">80 and all those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and we're seeing</font>

384
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">an average of about 400,000 flows per</font>

385
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,960
minute

386
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,740
so our<font color="#CCCCCC"> continual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation at first</font>

387
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,419
you know we need to do some additional

388
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">journey because there are still still</font>

389
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:58,860
events and offenses that are that are

390
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,840
false well I wouldn't call it false

391
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,020
positive so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say that they are</font>

392
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:09,149
probably irrelevant and there are also

393
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:11,158
things that that that are actually false

394
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,720
positives but I think when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made a lot</font>

395
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of leeway when we first got the system</font>

396
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,779
we're seeing upwards of 40,000 a minutes

397
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:23,549
um so it will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> webtoon it down quite</font>

398
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:25,649
a bit so we obviously need need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

399
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:28,200
capacity adjustments every single time

400
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:29,610
we add we add on a new system to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sin</font>

401
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,529
when you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> collecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> collecting</font>

402
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">from a new log stores you have to keep</font>

403
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,279
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have you do have a</font>

404
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,600
capacity limitation and we hit that

405
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,669
limitation there's gonna be a step cost

406
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,668
for you to go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to for you to go</font>

407
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:43,649
up to the next level and your hardware

408
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:46,710
hardware itself also has the limitations

409
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:47,729
so when you reach the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

410
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,100
limitation you have to go buy another

411
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,950
box which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hefty cost</font>

412
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:57,209
again so again understand your capacity

413
00:18:52,950 --> 00:19:00,270
is very important right now like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

414
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:04,289
before we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are struggling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with instant</font>

415
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:07,770
response so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a decent response</font>

416
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:10,260
integration is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a key to to a</font>

417
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,490
proper simeon plantation if you if you

418
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,799
know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problems then the</font>

419
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:20,100
plausible deniability is gone you have

420
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:21,330
to do something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right so so one</font>

421
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,620
one thing that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking is</font>

422
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,389
we're thinking about potentially

423
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,860
integrating with a managed security

424
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,059
service provider and have the security

425
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">service provider do the first level</font>

426
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,779
triage for us so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some lessons</font>

427
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,408
learned and I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of lessons</font>

428
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:40,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned so first first of which is this</font>

429
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,870
is a large financial investment now the

430
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,929

431
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,270
or that's excluding maintenance but the

432
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:50,309
initial<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost that that goes toward the</font>

433
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,940
same hardware and the software is not

434
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be enough so the sim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appliance</font>

435
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the support I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that that's only a</font>

436
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:58,480
small piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you have to also</font>

437
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,399
budget the f

438
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,470
ft x required to effectively manage them

439
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,780
understand so again you know you have

440
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:09,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the analytical horsepower you have to</font>

441
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,120
have analysts that go with it and and we

442
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,960
really have to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the hard way</font>

443
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,489
so additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> ft hours are going to be</font>

444
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,380
needed for instant handling and response

445
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,070
so with the sin you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

446
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,240
expecting to see quite a bit more

447
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,149
offenses things that maybe you'd

448
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,650
normally wouldn't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> will start popping</font>

449
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,929
up and you'll have to you have to be

450
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:33,070
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to triage those particular</font>

451
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:35,470
incidents so you will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

452
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,030
additional efforts you know for source

453
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,620
connection maintenance and sadness and

454
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,110
depending on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> marmon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you culture</font>

455
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,330
things are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different some</font>

456
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,189
sadness may be easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with some</font>

457
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,320
may not be and you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

458
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you know FISA political battles and</font>

459
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,490
and give the source and logs from them

460
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:55,929
and the other thing from the technical

461
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:59,290
perspective is sims most of the sims out

462
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,360
of the box they do take your most common

463
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,299
log sources however<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you start</font>

464
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">having some custom home brew system</font>

465
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:09,309
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send logs sometimes you need</font>

466
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have parsers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forever and depending on</font>

467
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,330
the vendor that you go with some vendors

468
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,760
will actually charge you for writing

469
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,918
custom parsers someone let you you know

470
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">write your own parsers and teach you how</font>

471
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,640
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so take that into</font>

472
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,929
consideration if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are looking</font>

473
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">at implementing send more if you are</font>

474
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">really in the process of implementing it</font>

475
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,870
and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will mention again</font>

476
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,440
increased investments fee to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

477
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:37,659
response and there's going to be a hefty

478
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,940
data storage<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost if you are if you're</font>

479
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,210
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your data for a prolonged</font>

480
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,530
period of time so just keep that in mind

481
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially if you won't do something</font>

482
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">like real-time packet captures and</font>

483
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,130
things like that is that's something

484
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're looking at now and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

485
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:58,510
storage is a storage<font color="#CCCCCC"> quarters in saying</font>

486
00:21:53,410 --> 00:22:01,120
so anyway um here's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other lessons</font>

487
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,730
learned so again like I mentioned before

488
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,620
is way too<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive as a law collector</font>

489
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:09,640
you really shouldn't be using this thing

490
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,989
as a as a as a long collector just

491
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,240
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the step costs that are that</font>

492
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,460
are

493
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:21,290
involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the additional capacity you</font>

494
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:23,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to you have to scope your</font>

495
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,790
expectations correctly so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

496
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capture are you trying to</font>

497
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:30,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture your ad data are you trying to</font>

498
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture your antivirus logs from your</font>

499
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,210
end points or your firewalls I mean I

500
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,490
understand what you what you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

501
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the beginning that's going to save</font>

502
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,480
you a lot of headaches down the road for

503
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,649
capacity upgrades and things like that

504
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">so and just keep in mind and for every</font>

505
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,580
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that you add to it you have</font>

506
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to plan additional capacity in terms of</font>

507
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,100
hardware and licensing as well as

508
00:22:51,670 --> 00:23:01,070
potentially your<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTEs so everything is</font>

509
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:04,100
tied tied in together so again plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan</font>

510
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,899
your capacity you want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

511
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,439
define<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope understand the call</font>

512
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:14,000
structure I known not every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single sim</font>

513
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,830
vendor have the same cost structure some

514
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,870
some of them will actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

515
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:21,139
events per second which is with what are

516
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,239
what our system uses basically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

517
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,550
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you once you pass a certain</font>

518
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,809
predefined and then events per second

519
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,309
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it's just gonna start dropping</font>

520
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,540
data when you don't you don't want the

521
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:34,910
thing to drop data because then you're

522
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:36,200
going blind you know for your girl

523
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,010
definitely missing certain things right

524
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">so if you're collecting NetFlow data you</font>

525
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,550
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand your capacity and the</font>

526
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,590
plan for the appropriate capacity and I

527
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,740
I honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you will know</font>

528
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,840
how much NetFlow data that you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

529
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,010
before you get get a sim<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet for me it</font>

530
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a chicken chicken and egg</font>

531
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,340
problem I mean I once i got the cinema

532
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,010
it's got a better understanding of our

533
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment and I thought well hey i</font>

534
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,950
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> i knew my environment but i</font>

535
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,110
didn't so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need all of these</font>

536
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,190
additional capacity but it if you have a

537
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">group if you have a better way of</font>

538
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,590
understanding your mom ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

539
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:11,480
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely do that understand your</font>

540
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,580
various changes around log sources you

541
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,890
know flow per minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost for net flow</font>

542
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:20,689
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> eps from logs in</font>

543
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:22,210
etc can't stress this way enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> fortify</font>

544
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,550
your instant handling capabilities

545
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,310
because you will see tons and tons of

546
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons coming through so what we what</font>

547
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:35,090
we ended up doing with our two thousand

548
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:39,199
events / / / week or two thousand

549
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:41,360
dollars per week is we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> classify those</font>

550
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,030
fences by the assets they affect right

551
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,860
so if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> tied to a category one asset</font>

552
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:50,210
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc you we get automatic notification</font>

553
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,310
to the to the security team email email

554
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,950
system so so then we were all what we

555
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:58,040
immediately go in that and triage triage

556
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:02,570
to set those have events for category

557
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">two in category</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three we don't do we</font>

558
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,510
don't prioritize it that way for

559
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:09,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">category two we basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log into the</font>

560
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:12,740
system and there's actually four for q1

561
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:14,360
there's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know ticketing</font>

562
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,550
triaging have a type of system<font color="#CCCCCC"> party</font>

563
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,229
built in so you you assign the category

564
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,510
choose first and if you have capacity

565
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,890
left over and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't if you have</font>

566
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:27,140
capacity left over you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

567
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:28,400
assign assign some of the more some of

568
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,000
the incidents that are actually

569
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,680
affecting category three assets so but

570
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,390
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way you can</font>

571
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,370
properly handle the incidents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

572
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,410
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean at least for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

573
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,000
only way that i found is that you have

574
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to prioritize your assets i mean babe</font>

575
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,920
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really base everything on risk</font>

576
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,960
right right now we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

577
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,940
heavily looking into the threat

578
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,310
landscape itself as far as the threat

579
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,810
types so basically anything that's

580
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,750
that's targeting category one will look

581
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:02,300
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's that's the bottom line</font>

582
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with with that particular model</font>

583
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,790
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going with we are able to at</font>

584
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,590
least function and handle all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

585
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:14,000
category one alerts every week with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

586
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">left over capacity to handle k no</font>

587
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,800
category too but not a whole lot of

588
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">capacity</font>

589
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,570
and again you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you want to ensure</font>

590
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have the ability to collect log</font>

591
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,330
and flow data so you determine whether a

592
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,309
log collection agent will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be required to</font>

593
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,100
collect logs of any log sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

594
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:36,450
so that's that's a parsers and you have

595
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,029
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure the parcels were working</font>

596
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,129
your architecture so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the log</font>

597
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:43,379
agents or I'm sorry that's that's not

598
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:45,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not the parsers but the log</font>

599
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:46,559
agents basically are the agents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

600
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,299
installed on the servers that that will

601
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,690
be responsible for forwarding logs to

602
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:54,450
your cell so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how your art</font>

603
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:58,320
how you architect your sim solution some

604
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:00,570
of the log agents<font color="#CCCCCC"> will actually forward</font>

605
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,990
only to one source like so like for

606
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,999
instance for us we we have to have the

607
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:10,230
category<font color="#CCCCCC"> one servers for this logs to</font>

608
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:12,720
both the syslog server and the sin right

609
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,809
now having having the server directly do

610
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,659
that is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult because our log</font>

611
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:20,428
collection agent can't can only four to

612
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,990
one source so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to do some monkey</font>

613
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,149
around with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the syslog server and then</font>

614
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,429
and then try to forward it directly from

615
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:29,580
the syslog server so again understand

616
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:31,379
the capabilities and capacity of your of

617
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,908
your log collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent it's going to</font>

618
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:39,619
be pretty important so and finally the

619
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:42,600
logs are low are really not enough so

620
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:45,149
you have to you have to also get your

621
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,799
flow data if you if you're only getting

622
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:50,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the logs you are really just getting</font>

623
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,549
half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture the flow data will</font>

624
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,840
end up telling you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more about</font>

625
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:55,889
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network I mean</font>

626
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,449
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say yeah there's a</font>

627
00:27:55,889 --> 00:28:02,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">thursday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized authentication</font>

628
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,129
happening on one particular server and

629
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,960
if you want to see whether data have

630
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:08,639
left that server or not then you need to

631
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,499
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see that flow data and</font>

632
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:11,908
see what what kind of info information

633
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:14,159
what kinda communications is happening

634
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:15,330
between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> your compromised asset</font>

635
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:22,600
and

636
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:26,470
end-to-end adversary right so the next

637
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">lesson is you have to use the data use</font>

638
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,390
the data data that you collect so

639
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,340
established establish your security

640
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,830
metrics for your organization based on

641
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,510
the data you collect and for us we

642
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,730
compared our data with some of the

643
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:42,129
industry statistics mostly based off of

644
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,500
the data breach statistics so we don't

645
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,350
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't really have the stats</font>

646
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,090
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what happen incidents are</font>

647
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,550
happening and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth but we</font>

648
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,889
do have stats on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of incidents</font>

649
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,990
are causing a data breach right so so

650
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,210
we're we're comparing our data with the

651
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">interview industry stats and with that</font>

652
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,230
with that comparison a lot of times you

653
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,140
can see the gaps between<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

654
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:09,520
environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the angry similar peer</font>

655
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:12,460
institutions so here are just some of

656
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the some of the metrics that we have</font>

657
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,570
defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in-house number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> visits</font>

658
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,790
per week and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the bottom</font>

659
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">graph on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Left that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

660
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,649
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is this week for the</font>

661
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,220
photos for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year so far and as you</font>

662
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,870
can see things are jumping everywhere

663
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,520
and again when you are seeing the

664
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,030
disparities you have to ask yourself why

665
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:36,129
and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into those those particular</font>

666
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,590
cases and you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean some of these</font>

667
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">things might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be caused by a new update</font>

668
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,780
to the sin they added some new detection

669
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,430
rules and those rules are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not tuned you</font>

670
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,770
know then all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> your events</font>

671
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:53,800
will just spiked up some may be caused

672
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:56,580
by may be caused by you know so some

673
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,050
type of external attack and he says<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

674
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,780
some also<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be caused by you know just</font>

675
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,419
simply the students you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being on</font>

676
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,240
being on site if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

677
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you look at the back then not the</font>

678
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,040
last two columns the last two columns

679
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:17,740
are actually averages but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

680
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:19,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lat I guess the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth column from</font>

681
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,580
from the back all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

682
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,149
down

683
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:28,230
as you as you see as the students left

684
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:33,070
the campus are using argan<font color="#E5E5E5"> students just</font>

685
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:35,320
dropped significantly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm suspecting</font>

686
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,610
that that is a pattern because we saw we

687
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,040
saw this we saw some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I</font>

688
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,530
during the winter and the first two

689
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,360
columns are actually the first couple of

690
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:47,610
weeks in January so again you are seeing

691
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,649
very very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity there so so</font>

692
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:53,350
the second metric that we have is the

693
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,990
most Harkavy systems you know what we

694
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:59,050
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you know who who are the</font>

695
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:01,090
attackers going going after right and

696
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,800
that that can really help<font color="#CCCCCC"> help us to</font>

697
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,899
identify the problem areas that we may

698
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,520
we may need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus focus on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

699
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">correlate with the most heart if we</font>

700
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,600
correlate the most targeted systems with

701
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,690
the type of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those systems are</font>

702
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:17,230
handling then we can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good</font>

703
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,910
handle on what type of on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

704
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">categorization or classification with</font>

705
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,450
that system so that we can you know

706
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,220
ensure we have the adequate you know

707
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:28,930
protection strategy executed against

708
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:30,340
those systems and the last one last one

709
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,610
I have up there is the most problem

710
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,600
prominent attack types and the sim is

711
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,129
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you all of the attack</font>

712
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,230
types because you still have theft<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

713
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,030
you still have a you know loss and human

714
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,740
error and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those type of things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

715
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:46,389
sim is probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to capture</font>

716
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but in terms of cyber attack it is</font>

717
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,660
going to let you see you know your

718
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:53,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">sequel sequel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> injections assuming that</font>

719
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,990
you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a some type of ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

720
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,970
can detect those type of those types of

721
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,310
attacks you'll be able to see that right

722
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,050
so you can you can see sequel injection

723
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:05,500
no virus infection and

724
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:09,550
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what not you know so the middle</font>

725
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:11,740
graph is actually actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack</font>

726
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,149
types<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't list the legend in</font>

727
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,020
there because I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

728
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">information i should share but but</font>

729
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,160
that's that's that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have and the</font>

730
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:25,360
last graph on in the back is basically

731
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,930
the systems that are that are being

732
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,929
targeted and that is also correlated

733
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:36,550
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of attacks that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

734
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:39,880
targeting system so and well I guess

735
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,889
I'll finish you already okay so um last

736
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,440
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to mention is resources</font>

737
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,990
resources and resources so resource is

738
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,180
very important you will need at least

739
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,680
one ft for a small to medium

740
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation this is a coordinate</font>

741
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">partner and for us I mean we I wouldn't</font>

742
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">call call ourselves a small</font>

743
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,379
implementation we're probably a medium

744
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,260
to large<font color="#CCCCCC"> movement implementation so</font>

745
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:08,610
assigning the adequate fts to to the to

746
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:14,770
the to the project is imperative you

747
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:17,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sim is tuned</font>

748
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:20,889
so if you if you don't have if you don't

749
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,760
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sim work if the sim is not</font>

750
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,070
tuned<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a lot of</font>

751
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,020
white noises and the white noises are

752
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,510
just basically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause headaches</font>

753
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,680
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyst and and and it's not</font>

754
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,160
going to provide you much value so that

755
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,360
you have to tune out the right noises

756
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,270
ensure the properties and response

757
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,879
procedures are updated incorporates your

758
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,100
help desk if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I mean if they can</font>

759
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,670
they can help you do some type of first

760
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:47,649
level triage or even if you involve<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

761
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,230
your network operations center if you

762
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">need 24 by 7 triage you can do that or</font>

763
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,400
you know try to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ms SPS and</font>

764
00:33:52,990 --> 00:34:00,790
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they may be you</font>

765
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:02,530
may also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and again</font>

766
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,620
you know ensure an adequate<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTEs</font>

767
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:07,180
assigned and ensure you keep ensure that

768
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,460
human capital is properly trained to

769
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,560
handle the same appliance if you throw

770
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,940
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> SM and where they have no</font>

771
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,040
experience in dealing

772
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,990
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network traffic we're looking at</font>

773
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at logs I mean you're probably not</font>

774
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:20,199
going to get much out of it so again

775
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,270
make sure people are trained and make

776
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you have enough resources for this</font>

777
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,699
so here's here's the bottom line my

778
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:29,408
submarine so you know you can choose

779
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:31,540
choose choose ignorance illusion of

780
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:33,460
knowledge or knowledge i chose knowledge

781
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:39,159
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have some regrets but you know for</font>

782
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:40,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most part hey it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good so if</font>

783
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,950
you choose if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do shoes knowledge</font>

784
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,189
just remember that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

785
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">borrow the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spider-man</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online so the with</font>

786
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:50,050
great power comes comes with great

787
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:51,879
responsibility and knowledge have to be

788
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,099
paired<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a diligent divisions to care</font>

789
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,078
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it there's no</font>

790
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:57,730
plausible deniability do something about

791
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,130
it and make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be</font>

792
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:04,839
justified<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the court of law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in case if</font>

793
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">you in case of some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something really</font>

794
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:10,089
hits the fan right so anyway be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure to</font>

795
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,970
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the scope and adequately fund</font>

796
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:15,790
the project and again I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

797
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:18,029
good good answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this for us it was</font>

798
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,319
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chicken egg problem I mean we</font>

799
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,670
didn't understand our scope didn't

800
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,869
understand our environment until we got

801
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same min then we understood it on</font>

802
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:27,670
you Merman better and ended up having

803
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">thump some more money into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the project</font>

804
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:33,310
but anyway finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adequate</font>

805
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:37,210
resources to the project alright so I

806
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:38,920
got the STFU sign if you guys have any

807
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,450
more questions I feel free to come come

808
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,180
up and ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and not i'll be having the</font>

809
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,180
answer thank you
