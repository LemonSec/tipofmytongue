1
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,528
thanks

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,939
can Chris for inviting me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come the</font>

3
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,920
wedding wasn't my wedding it was my

4
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:31,640
wife's best friend and you know how

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,220
these situations kind of go I think so

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,940
yeah so it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here obviously</font>

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,360
my first time and I do talk around

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,790
around application security all the time

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,650
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I change it up a little</font>

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit and talk about the future of</font>

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">government information sharing because I</font>

12
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:53,510
see I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going in the wrong</font>

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,830
direction here with information sharing

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:02,000
and you know if it was bad in the past

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,849
it's get it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting worse and so this</font>

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,250
this time magazine cover is actually who

17
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:11,780
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess what year this is from there's</font>

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,520
actually a clue on there yeah it's

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,310
actually it's 90 95 but yeah it's

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,070
because Jerry Garcia died that year and

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,840
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it says the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US rushes to</font>

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,298
turn computers into tomorrow's weapons

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,549
of destruction but how vulnerable is the

24
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,050
home front so it's kind of interesting

25
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,020
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been going on now</font>

26
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:33,380
for almost 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking the same</font>

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem thinking about cyber war I don't</font>

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,470
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is when it was first coined</font>

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:42,490
or not but the it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is</font>

30
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:46,520
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the dialogue right of how</font>

31
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:49,460
we're discussing information risk and

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,740
sharing information and if we talk about

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a war context we're going to</font>

34
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">end up with information sharing that</font>

35
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,020
looks like the information sharing that

36
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,320
the military<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the intelligence</font>

37
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,699
community benefits most from and there

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,149
won't be any information sharing that

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,598
harms those interests right that's not

40
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">how we you know do do everything in the</font>

41
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,768
world everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't focused on the</font>

42
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:15,530
military being being the sole

43
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:20,810
beneficiary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so right now it seems</font>

44
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:22,129
like as Congress debates what to do with

45
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,420
how the government is going to be

46
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:28,250
involved it it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the military</font>

47
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,409
seems to have the ear of everybody and

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,599
maybe the vendors have part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

49
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:35,380
ear and that's that's kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

50
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">dialogue it is like</font>

51
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,570
so you know to give an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I</font>

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,890
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> last month the the D H came out</font>

53
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,870
with their enhanced cyber security

54
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,850
services they call it information

55
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">sharing the law says you have to do</font>

56
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,130
information sharing i call this

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,660
collecting and hiding information right

58
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,660
and so the enhanced cyber security

59
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,329
services are basically secret black

60
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,100
boxes that if you ask the government

61
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,600
they will install on your network if

62
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,060
your critical infrastructure there might

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,910
be some organizations that are forced to

64
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,910
have these black boxes and they have

65
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,370
secret signatures on them and so they

66
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,530
collect information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they're</font>

67
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDS's that are filled with secret secret</font>

68
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,490
signatures that have been collected from

69
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">other sources we can't get to see those</font>

70
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,440
signatures because that might show us

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,190
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are 0 days out there that are</font>

72
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,520
being exploited by adversaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

73
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,850
might expose a vulnerability that the US

74
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,010
government wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use in offense so</font>

75
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,160
you can see the information sharing here

76
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,560
is the least amount possible or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most amount possible with by but</font>

78
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,530
still keeping the the US government's

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,480
ability to wage offensive offensive

80
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,180
warfare right offensive cyber attacks

81
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,880
now think about what if we did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

82
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> medical context right we definitely</font>

83
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:05,480
there's definitely research around bio

84
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,930
weapons but there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge amount</font>

85
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of research around health would you want</font>

86
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,750
like diseases not being researched or

87
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,269
disclosed because they had the potential

88
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,370
to be a bio weapon maybe that's actually

89
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,039
going on I don't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems</font>

90
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">like not benefiting the most people</font>

91
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,990
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what seems to be</font>

92
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,490
happening here when<font color="#E5E5E5"> information we're</font>

93
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,870
kept in the dark about vulnerabilities

94
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,980
because those vulnerabilities want the

95
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,250
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use those for</font>

96
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,470
offense so that's sort of what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

97
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the this is the latest idea about</font>

98
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,760
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing is this enhanced</font>

99
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,400
cyber security services which seems to

100
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">me be going in the wrong direction the</font>

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,289
other the other vision is<font color="#CCCCCC"> CISPA</font>

102
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,420
and this one has been you know talked

103
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,810
about in Congress<font color="#CCCCCC"> for over a year now</font>

104
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,220
and finally the latest version failed

105
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,990
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea here is this would feed</font>

106
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,170
into the the enhanced cyber security

107
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,930
services right the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government</font>

108
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,490
would collect threat information attack

109
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:14,110
signatures attack sources to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

110
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,110
program their their intrusion detection

111
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,820
systems and it's essentially collected

112
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,000
by the government collected by industry

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,010
and shared and shared in secret so again

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,720
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected hide information even</font>

115
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,420
though they like to say it's it's it's

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,370
collect and share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information this this</font>

117
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,370
this failed because there's all kinds of

118
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,650
privacy problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and there's</font>

119
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,720
probably privacy problems with the be

120
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,140
enhanced cyber security services out

121
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,330
there now but we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know about</font>

122
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's a classified piece of</font>

123
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,830
equipment we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know what's</font>

124
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:51,159
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other interesting thing</font>

125
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:55,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">about enhanced cyber security services</font>

126
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,390
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cispa is there's no notion of root</font>

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,030
cause there's no notion of actually

128
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,700
figuring out what what caused this

129
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,799
problem to happen it's just threat

130
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,360
information it's just what does the

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,190
attack look like where is it coming from

132
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,260
what is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signature of it</font>

133
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,240
there's no idea of actually getting to

134
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,900
the root cause so to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

135
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,220
medical analogy it's it's more of

136
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,349
treating the symptoms right we're not

137
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually getting at what's the weather</font>

138
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:27,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the cures that to fix</font>

139
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:29,710
these problems so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started thinking</font>

140
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">about you know what if we start to we</font>

141
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,520
start to think about you know

142
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,450
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk out of a warfare</font>

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,099
context and in a health and safety

144
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,810
context because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a lot of</font>

145
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that the government does well to</font>

146
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,390
help keep everyone healthy and keep

147
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,010
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

148
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,050
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do this and so I went</font>

149
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:57,700
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some of the organizations</font>

150
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,850
that that that do this constantly so the

151
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,770
Center for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Disease Control collects</font>

152
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,500
information about communicable disease

153
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,930
is right so we can detect epidemics so

154
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,500
we can figure out things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what what</font>

155
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,470
type of flu flu vaccine we should create

156
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,270
each year and if there are there new

157
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,889
diseases that are cropping up that have

158
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,250
entered<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the country and we have to</font>

159
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:26,020
start to think about think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

160
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:28,360
OSHA is occupant Occupational Safety and

161
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,400
Health Administration i'm not sure what

162
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,500
it stands for but the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever</font>

163
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,479
there's an industrial accident we want

164
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,280
to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that right there's some</font>

165
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,758
procedure there's some process there's

166
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,719
some piece of equipment that's not safe

167
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,210
and when incidents happen we should

168
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,889
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that incident and see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

169
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,030
people who are using that process other

170
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,580
people who are using that equipment

171
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,960
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to change right the</font>

172
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,669
fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font>

173
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,620
you know you're able to do root cause

174
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,840
analysis because you have this reporting

175
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:04,199
then there's a consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> product safety</font>

176
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:06,880
commission which is takes reports of

177
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,289
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are unsafe you know a lot</font>

178
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of children's projects and finally</font>

179
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,710
there's the National Transportation

180
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,489
Safety Board which investigates

181
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:19,719
transportation incidents and so I went

182
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,340
and looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you know how do these how</font>

183
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,620
does the reporting function work how's

184
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,359
the information collected<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it turns</font>

185
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,940
out for all four of these agencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

186
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,690
mandatory right if you fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the</font>

187
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:35,679
law that that started these different

188
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,958
organizations at your organization it's

189
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,939
actually a legal requirement for you to

190
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,309
follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> through so for the CDC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

191
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,390
mandatory reporting of infection

192

diseases by clinicians so whenever

193
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,470
clinician diagnosis an infectious

194
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,839

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,579
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country now having that rich</font>

about what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with infectious</font>

record-keeping requirement where you

have to use their system and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

205
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,209
there's a serious incident workplace

incident

207
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:19,179
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how that's defined it's</font>

208
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably someone had to go to the</font>

209
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:25,269
hospital that<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be recorded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

210
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,509
there's all kinds of data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be</font>

211
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,790
recorded<font color="#E5E5E5"> along along with that so</font>

212
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,929
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can't hide that</font>

213
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,929
information they can't hide the fact

214
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:36,610
that maybe their procedure was not the

215
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,529
right procedure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used by</font>

216
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,259
an employee and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they got hurt or</font>

217
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,269
they're using equipment which is been

218
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,369
deemed to be unsafe they can't they

219
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:49,290
can't hide that fact but if you think

220
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:52,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what we do with with data breaches</font>

221
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,819
companies are able to hide what<font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

222
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong all the time you know did an</font>

223
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:58,329
employee does not configure something

224
00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:01,240
properly did they not patch something

225
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,579
did they write code and not test it that

226
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,319
is constantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> being hidden from us that</font>

227
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:07,420
organizations are doing this because

228
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:11,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's no there's no requirement to</font>

229
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:16,779
report that if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer</font>

230
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:19,240
protection it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Product Safety Act it</font>

231
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,069
says within 24 hours manufacturers

232
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,449
importers distributors and retails are

233
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:26,170
required to report when there's a

234
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,299
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be a substantial</font>

235
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk of injury they're required to do</font>

236
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:34,389
that there's penalties and fines if you

237
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:36,670
sell a product that you know is is

238
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,110
dangerous or you or you become a way

239
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,319
area the manufacturer you become aware

240
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,240
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers told</font>

241
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:46,509
you about it you're required to report

242
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,819
that do software vendors do this when

243
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:51,309
they know about you know defects that

244
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,110
are out there in the wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> no they can</font>

245
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:55,240
handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> it whatever way they want they</font>

246
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,740
decide what's in their economic interest

247
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,799
what's in their marketing<font color="#E5E5E5"> interests</font>

248
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,389
right their product is it has a defect

249
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's putting users of the product at</font>

250
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,589
risk they've disclaimed all liability in

251
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EULA so they can basically do</font>

252
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,839
whatever they want right they don't have

253
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,959
to fix it or they can silently fix it a

254
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,220
year from now they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically do</font>

255
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,920
whatever they want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no there's no</font>

256
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,509
requirement that for them to actually

257
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,309
fix any defects or notify people of

258
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,639
defects so we treating software

259
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:28,959
completely differently than then devices

260
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,160
in the physical world and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

261
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,508
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the national train</font>

262
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,939
rotation and Safety Bureau and basically

263
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:39,009
if there's any type of aviation incident

264
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,480
they have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> notified it's the law</font>

265
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,040
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to you have to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll</font>

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,870
lose your pilot's license if you don't

267
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,910
do that you'll be fined and so I decided

268
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,040
to focus on the NTSB and see how they do

269
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,060
things because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

270
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,089
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the closest to besides maybe</font>

271
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,459
the consumer products and safety of of

272
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,889
what information sharing really should

273
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:09,069
look like that that can that can help

274
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:13,600
everyone so commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> airlines started</font>

275
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:16,209
in the 1920s first started just

276
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,800
basically airmail was the first use got

277
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:20,829
mail across the country in the day

278
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:24,639
that's that's it was a big benefit but

279
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:28,529
as the 1920s evolved and planes got

280
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,439
bigger and safer passenger service

281
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:35,910
started and then in the 30s they

282
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:38,980
actually had<font color="#E5E5E5"> international flights and</font>

283
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,199
airlines became profitable but one thing

284
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened with all this new air traffic</font>

285
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:47,680
there was hundreds of accidents a year

286
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:50,110
we're happening but with with planes as

287
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,380
you can as you can imagine when there's

288
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,339
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of new technology out there it</font>

289
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,139
starts to be used and accidents happen

290
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then eventually we say hey maybe we</font>

291
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:05,699
should start to make this a little bit

292
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:11,290
safer it sounds like computers to me so

293
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:13,059
the NTSB was was formed in 1938 there

294
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,930
was a law passed it was the Civil

295
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:19,600
Aeronautics Board and so as accidents

296
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,739
started to happen in the 30s the

297
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,180
government said hey we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do something about this no one's</font>

299
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,209
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to fly in a plane there's</font>

300

all these benefits of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

301
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:28,508
dying we need we need to do something

302
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this we need to we need to</font>

303
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:35,709
regulate this industry and so in 1938

304
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:37,930
they passed the law to form the NTSB's

305
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,729
predecessor they just changed the name

306
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:43,479
at will afterwards the Civil Aeronautics

307
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,960
Board and the first major investigation

308
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,100
was in

309
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:51,400
1840 it was a Douglas dc-3 a crashed

310
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,460
somewhere around DC I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

311
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,060
like 20 or 30 people on board and

312
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:01,000
including a u.s. senator and a lot of

313
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">people died in the plane and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,980
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first incident</font>

315
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:11,190
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> reported so 20 years or so</font>

316
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:13,510
after commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel became a reality</font>

317
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,470
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government said hey we're</font>

318
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to step in and we're going to</font>

319
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,580
start to investigate why these planes

320
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,180
are crashing and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font>

321
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how to make it better what went</font>

322
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong what were the procedures or where</font>

323
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,270
this was their mechanical error

324
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,650
mechanical problems that could be fixed

325
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:33,490
well unless we can figure out why the

326
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,689
plane crash we're we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

327
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,470
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> improvement so we're not going to</font>

328
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave it just to the vendor to</font>

329
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,060
investigate this like Douglas I'm sure

330
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,980
douglas aircraft was pretty interested

331
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,300
in looking at this plane and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing what</font>

332
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,430
happened to see if it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a technical</font>

333
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,770
failure but if what if it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

334
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,620
procedural failure or the or the pilot

335
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,150
didn't have the right training or maybe

336
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,740
Douglas wanted to keep this a secret

337
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,240
because they don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scare people</font>

338
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,240
from flying their other planes which

339
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,280
were all at risk you know it sounds like

340
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be bad for air travel right</font>

341
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:11,170
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's exactly what we have now with</font>

342
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:13,780
with computer security so here's a chart

343
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:17,020
of air<font color="#E5E5E5"> accidents from nineteen eighteen</font>

344
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,329
to 2009 I wish it was normalized to the

345
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:23,290
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actual flights because we know</font>

346
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:28,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the flights are increasing hugely</font>

347
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:30,490
especially between 1980 and and 2000 but

348
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:34,600
the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is you have this</font>

349
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:38,530
quick ramp up of incidents from 19<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 to</font>

350
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,960
19 40 or 41 or so you're going from

351
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,870
around a hundred to five hundred in a

352
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">20-year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period that's per year so you</font>

353
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,520
can see like right around nineteen forty

354
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,170
people are saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font>

355
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,600
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this that slope just</font>

356
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,560
can't keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and that's when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

357
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,910
NTSB was formed and so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

358
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,890
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only reason that the</font>

359
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,569
accidents started to come down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

360
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,280
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a factor it's just too much of</font>

361
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,530
a coincidence that accident started to

362
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,380
dramatically come down right after there

363
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,660
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an agency of the US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government was</font>

reporting of every incident and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

368
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,040

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our breaches that keep going up and</font>

372
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,430
up and up one way to stop that is to

373
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:37,120
start to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes and do things like</font>

374
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,160
the NTSB so here's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of the</font>

375
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,060
aviation disclosure form it's on the web

376
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,829
now every every incident that happens no

377
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,680
matter how minor people don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know even be injured if a plane goes</font>

379
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,900
down in a way that it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

380
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:56,800
land the pilots required to fill out

381
00:16:52,900 --> 00:17:00,910
fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> out this form and this is a this is</font>

382
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,290
actually the the query mechanism so you

383
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,240
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can search for any</font>

384
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,339
airline incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's ever happened</font>

385
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,990
and find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the details about it</font>

386
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,959
you can mine that data and study that

387
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:15,310
data we have nothing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

388
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,960
computer incidents and here's here's an

389
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,179
example of a form i pulled up it was

390
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:23,890
near where I live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stowe Massachusetts</font>

391
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:28,210
where a pilot with two passengers flying

392
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,760
a little Cessna crashed his plane on

393
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,050
landing no one no one was hurt<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you</font>

394
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,640
can see I don't you probably can't see

395
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,110
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of detail this is only</font>

396
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,630
the first page there's like four pages

397
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:45,639
of detail that that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be filled</font>

398
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:47,380
out for every incident and then there's

399
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,540
actually a narrative history of the

400
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,900
flight you probably can't read that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

401
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:55,210
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can read it but it says talks about</font>

402
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,550
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the landing on final approach</font>

403
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,740
began to pick up gusts below the tree

404
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,760
line wind shear picked up on short final

405
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,590
roughly 75 feet altitude lost lift due

406
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,470
to wind shear added power to compensate

407
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,449
and go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I touched on the threshold</font>

408
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,380
and was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> around when a gust pushed</font>

409
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,490
me to the left

410
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,770
I realized I wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

411
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the trees</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I reduced power and tried</font>

412
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,980
to turn right to stay over the runway I

413
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit the trees and the left of the runway</font>

414
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">and came to a stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I confer nobody was</font>

415
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,820
hurt and had them egress to the left

416
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:28,419
side door<font color="#CCCCCC"> y secured the plane so it</font>

417
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,820
seems pretty pretty mundane and then but

418
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:35,130
the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is the pilot has</font>

419
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:37,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in a recommendation here from</font>

420
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,870
what the pilot learned during the

421
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident it asks what is your safety</font>

recommendation how could this accident

423
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,810
or incident have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevented and the</font>

424
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,030
pilot puts in a weather reporting

425
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,760
station would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much wind</font>

426
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,830
was gusting on the airport a windsock

427
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,220
within sight of runway 30 would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

428
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,889
helped detect us in crosswinds so for

429
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,840
this really mundane incident no gladly

430
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,700
no one was hurt we got a recommendation

431
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,080
which seems like a clear improvement for

432
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,670
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Airport there's no wind sock</font>

433
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,550
there's no weather reporting station

434
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:13,780
telling him or her what the wind is what

435
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,260
if we did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every computer</font>

436
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,600
incident that happened if people were

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:23,320
required to report what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew about</font>

438
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,679
the incident and were required to put in

439
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,500
recommendations to say how they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

440
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,960
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and then we could go and</font>

441
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,990
query that information we could go and

442
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,490
query all of that and learn and people

443
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,040
could study it and figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

444
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,290
improve without visibility into the

445
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,980
details of the incidents really we just

446
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,210
have anecdotal detail we have detailed

447
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,000
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the incidents we've been involved</font>

448
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">in or if we're lucky to have someone to</font>

449
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about talk about an incident</font>

450
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,010
there's all kinds of reasons people

451
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,110
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about incidents that</font>

452
00:19:54,010 --> 00:20:01,690
hide a huge amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information from</font>

453
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:04,030
us so the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these reports is</font>

454
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:08,110
to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the incidence and recruit</font>

455
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:12,550
improve do the root cause analysis get

456
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,530
recommendations and also do public

457
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,690
investigations for serious incidents so

458
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,170
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a minor incident there's no need</font>

459
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:25,200
to do an investigation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone</font>

460
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:27,630
had died or it was a larger aircraft

461
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,429
there would be a public investigation so

462
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,250
you wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go by what the</font>

463
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:35,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">owner/operator piloted the plane had to</font>

464
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">say you know I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're being</font>

465
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
truthful because they could be

466
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:44,639
investigated at any time and lose their

467
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,860
pilot's license if they weren't but the

468
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:51,120
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> investigation puts people that</font>

469
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,439
are experts that have tools and

470
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,360
capabilities and knowledge to

471
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:59,639
investigate an incident that a who's

472
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,158
just a night you know a pilot<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we'd</font>

473
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:04,500
look use the corollary in in the IT

474
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,909
space you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of companies don't</font>

475
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,559
have sophisticated investigators to do

476
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:13,950
their forensics and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't always</font>

477
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,010
call in an expert so we don't even know

478
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,360
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could have learned from incidents</font>

479
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:20,100
we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even be learning from them</font>

480
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,629
because the reporting is so bad and

481
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,168
there's no there's no public

482
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:27,690
investigation to go on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it but the</font>

483
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:29,279
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this is this follows sound</font>

484
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,679
engineering principle of learning from

485
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:36,690
failures<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineers learnt love to learn</font>

486
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:40,919
from failures you know if a if any part

487
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,720
of that plane was defective and a piece

488
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,309
of that pain failed i can tell you the

489
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,990
engineers that built that plane want to

490
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:49,620
know everything they can about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

491
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:53,190
then they want to fix it same thing with

492
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,789
you know a bridge collapsing right the

493
00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:02,100
engineers want to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix that</font>

494
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:03,779
it just seems with with computers it's

495
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost like the engineers wants you to</font>

496
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:07,200
go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> when there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> failure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

497
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,700
they don't want to hear about the

498
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,519
incidents they barely want to hear about

499
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,990
the vulnerability reports when there's

500
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,669
clearly a defect in their product and

501
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's interesting that that engineering</font>

502
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">discipline i was i was i I was trained</font>

503
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,070
as an engineer in that computer and

504
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:30,419
systems engineering at Rensselaer and a

505
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:33,110
lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the training was that was to</font>

506
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,429
use the the engineering mindset and

507
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,918
which i think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> different than than the</font>

508
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:38,970
computer science the computer science

509
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,700
mindset so

510
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,929
Engineers want to learn from what want

511
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,919
to learn from their failures and I don't

512
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have enough engineering</font>

513
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,400
discipline the way we you know build

514
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:50,220
software and build build build computer

515
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,970
systems is that that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem</font>

516
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be something that people care about</font>

517
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:59,490
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outcome of all this collecting of</font>

518
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,840
the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public investigations</font>

519
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,750
really is two different things so they

520
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,799
have safety recommendations and safety

521
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:10,799
alerts so safety recommendations are

522
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,720
directed at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization best able</font>

523
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to address the safety issue whether it's</font>

524
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,289
public or private so if they that that

525
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">airport there which needs a windsock</font>

526
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,158
maybe it needs a weather reporting

527
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,900
station that the pilot has access to

528
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,600
that would be a recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

529
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:31,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">airport it's you know you need to you</font>

530
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,699
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put in a windsock right if it</font>

531
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:38,460
was a metal fatigue in a particular kind

532
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of airplane wing it would be the</font>

533
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,530
manufacturer would say hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

534
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,870
these these wings after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years are</font>

535
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,700
getting fatigued and failing right

536
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:51,149
that's what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> determined from our</font>

537
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,980
investigation so we're notifying you so

538
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,659
you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to take this plane out</font>

539
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">of service before this or you figure out</font>

540
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,010
a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have this fail or have have</font>

541
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,480
a way to repair it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the person</font>

542
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:05,549
best suited to address the issue and

543
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,549
then they have safety alerts which are

544
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,860
more general general alerts this one

545
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:13,230
here this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most recent safety</font>

546
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,260
alert that that came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a month</font>

547
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago which is basically to anyone</font>

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,830
operating a plane activate leading-edge

549
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,690
deice boots as soon as airplane enters

550
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,820
icing conditions thin amount of ice as

551
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,200
little as quarter-inch can be deadly so

552
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,299
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of lots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

recommendation about how to operate a

555
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,939
plane in icing conditions in everyone

556
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,770
read every pilot sees this and every

557
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,659
pilot follows this it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

558
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:46,950
when you think about you know computer

559
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,120
security notifications it doesn't seem

560
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">like people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are following the</font>

notifications for all the technology

they use or even aware

563
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,169
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're so fragmented</font>

564
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:59,050
there's not one place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go and</font>

565
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get information about ways to run</font>

566
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:10,720
your systems more securely so now over

567
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,490
to the the cyber realm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

568
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,040
put this up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sometimes it's</font>

569
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,690
depressing when I see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber security hearings and I'm sure</font>

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are smart people that our staffers</font>

out there and people are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

do we tackle other safety problems or

health problems that lens just isn't put

00:25:52,840 --> 00:26:02,830
on it so but there is a there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

584
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,870
quasi-government agency actually and now

585
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,790
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s it's a fully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> funded government</font>

586
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:11,530
agency that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does have a history with</font>

587
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet incidents so in 1988 after the</font>

588
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:20,950
Morris worm ran around the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

589
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:24,399
DARPA funded assert coordination center

590
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:27,070
at carnegie mellon and they were funded

591
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,450
to coordinate a response to incidents so

592
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,310
the idea was well what are we going to

593
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,410
do when these worms happen someone's got

594
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:36,159
to someone's got to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what's</font>

595
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:39,160
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and we have to come up with a</font>

596
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,080
way to stop it and a way to fix it it

597
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,450
maybe make some recommendations so that

598
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,540
people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know can run their systems so</font>

599
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,800
it's less<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely that this happens again</font>

600
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,990
so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what the outcome of</font>

601
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Morris worm is actually it's</font>

602
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,270
available online there's like a 40 page

603
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,060
document of the investigation it reads

604
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">like one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these NTSB reports I read</font>

605
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,310
the report from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dc-3 plane that</font>

606
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,770
crashed in 1940 and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

607
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:08,260
same length as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

608
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,060
Boris worm which went through it had

609
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,879
source code it had all the different

610
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:16,149
debugging things about how how the worm

611
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,710
operated recommendations on how to

612
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:22,630
harden systems recommendations on how to

613
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:26,890
you know coordinate coordinate responses

614
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,900
to other worms in the future and it kind

615
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:33,970
of reminded me of the early days<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

616
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:35,650
NTSB and then we had but the internet

617
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,450
was still very small back then write<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

618
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:41,760
internet was just it wasn't commercial

619
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:44,800
yet and in 1992 Congress passed the law

620
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,900
that allowed commercial traffic to go

621
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,629
over NSFNET which was the backbone of

622
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,280
the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where Al Gore</font>

623
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,650
gets his famous I invented the internet

624
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,580
because he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that promoted</font>

625
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:59,440
this this law so he seriously misspoke

626
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,919
there but he does deserve credit for

627
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,890
opening up the you know the academic

628
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:09,100
government's internet to to commercial

629
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and here we are 21 years later and</font>

630
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:16,000
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge success but</font>

631
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">also 20 years later what happened to our</font>

632
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,390
internet investigation capability right

633
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,490
it was there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font>

634
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,320
it was like when the first plane went up

635
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,840
they said hey you know or when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very</font>

636
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plane crashed they said hey we're</font>

637
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to do something about</font>

638
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,250
these plane crashes we're going to

639
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,070
investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't happen it was 20</font>

640
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,990
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of plane crashes it was if you</font>

641
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked at my chart it had to get the 500</font>

642
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:43,240
plane crashes a year before anything

643
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,910
happened but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> something did happen</font>

644
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,180
it seemed to seem to make a positive

645
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,680
effect so here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet incident</font>

646
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,790
we had it right away at the very first

647
00:28:50,680 --> 00:29:00,040
serious incident the Morris worm but

648
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the cert CC ended up not really</font>

649
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,080
being funded as the internet grew and as

650
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:09,399
incidents picked up so that capability

651
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:13,120
went by went went away really and what

652
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:17,500
cert changed into is just coordinating

653
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,600
vulnerability disclosure and that's kind

654
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,610
of how it was throughout the 90s

655
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,789
if there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vulnerability in</font>

656
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,809
especially in shared code that was

657
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:28,179
shared across a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

658
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">products like operating system code or</font>

659
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:34,840
libraries they did a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good job at</font>

660
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:37,809
at coordinating all the vendors to fix

661
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:42,100
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and release that but there</font>

662
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:45,549
was no real incident capability that

663
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,199
that one that went by the wayside now

664
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:51,549
there is an incident capability starting

665
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:57,210
to pick up that's so I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just take</font>

666
00:29:51,549 --> 00:30:00,010
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> step back so DHS decided to fund cert</font>

667
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:04,350
about about five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and they</font>

668
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:07,270
change the name to us-cert gov and

669
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:10,330
there's a section of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now called</font>

670
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:13,270
ics-cert industrial industrial control

671
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:16,000
system sir and that team actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

672
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:19,418
do investigations so they track the

673
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,059
vulnerabilities that are in industrial

674
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:24,549
control systems and if there are

675
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:26,770
incidents at critical infrastructure

676
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:29,650
facilities they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do formal</font>

677
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,990
investigations of those incidents but

678
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,940
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's secret</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right we</font>

679
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't we don't get to learn so there was</font>

680
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,960
three there was three in 2009 when they

681
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,289
started doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there was three</font>

682
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:45,330
incidents that they investigated and now

683
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:49,299
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2012 they investigated 177</font>

684
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:52,600
incidents but we don't we don't get to

685
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:54,970
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened what was the root</font>

686
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,799
cause you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about those</font>

687
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,169
incidents all we know is a number there

688
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,668
are industrial control system incidents

689
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:02,230
which I mean we probably knew that

690
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:04,299
already but at least we know kind of the

691
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:10,590
scope of it but it's in secret again

692
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's in secret so we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

693
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:17,049
some laws that compel incident

694
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:22,860
disclosure and they're all focused

695
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:27,280
around data breaches and PII so these

696
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:30,370
these laws were<font color="#CCCCCC"> not created to learn</font>

697
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,230
from these incidents and improve they

698
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,370
were just created to protect the

699
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,370
consumers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

700
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:40,899
risk so let them know they're at risk

701
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:43,030
now of identity theft so these data

702
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,750
breach laws<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kate California had the</font>

703
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:49,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one around 2003 or maybe a little</font>

704
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,220
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier and pretty much most of the</font>

705
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,320
states have them now they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

706
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:56,290
laws there is no national unifying law

707
00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:01,540
they've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it but but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it</font>

708
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:05,200
hasn't passed and its really only for

709
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:08,139
incidents or PII is stolen where you

710
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,179
could be at risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> for identity theft now</font>

711
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,100
California did something that was

712
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:14,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interesting just I think</font>

713
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago they passed the</font>

714
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:22,450
disclosure requirements that if it's

715
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:24,790
just email addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hashed password</font>

716
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:28,150
information that that needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

717
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:31,990
disclosed also so organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

718
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:35,950
that information this is a compromised

719
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:37,720
have to report that now if it i guess if

720
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,850
anyone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> california is affected which</font>

721
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,710
probably means everyone has to report

722
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,850
that now it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law so new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

723
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,950
think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people have thought this</font>

724
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,370
through because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sites</font>

725
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,920
out there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little tiny sites that maybe</font>

726
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,919
it's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordpress site that has</font>

727
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,360

<font color="#E5E5E5">wordpress site gets breached and you</font>

729
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,830
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> california resident as one of</font>

00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:02,890
your users the law says<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to make</font>

731
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,649
a notification of your breach now we see

732
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:07,570
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things where you know a</font>

733
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,640
vulnerability comes out in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress</font>

734
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,840
and we see thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of WordPress sites</font>

735
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,160
breached you know in a matter of days

736
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,809
are we going to get thousands of

737
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,059
disclosures from all those wordpress

738
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:21,780
sites I don't know so it'd be

739
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:24,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is</font>

740
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:28,000
California says hey that that person is

741
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:30,270
at risk now because of some failure by

742
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,220
the site owner they should have to tell

743
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:36,160
the people who are at enhanced risk that

744
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:41,860
this happened so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

745
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:45,100
interesting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fair to not</font>

746
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:47,080
have a data loss DB org slide in here

747
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,559
and

748
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,139
this is this is the incidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

749
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,110
that are public so it gets public one

750
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:58,299
way or another it could be because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

751
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,399
disclosure requirement because PII was

752
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:03,129
breached and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's probably why</font>

753
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,529
most of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> incidents become public</font>

754
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,480
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see that it's it's ink seems</font>

755
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:09,790
to be pretty much increasing the trend

756
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,710
is increasing each year in 2013 would

757
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:14,168
probably only have you know three months

758
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">of data there and it looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could</font>

759
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:20,799
potentially get up get up to 2012 so

760
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,879
data breaches are certainly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

761
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,369
increase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then here's this different</font>

762
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,159
state state laws like each state has

763
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:31,980
different requirements I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

764
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,580
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing software</font>

765
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:40,449
to automate incident response and the

766
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,710
most the most the part the part of their

767
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:44,500
functionality that's the most

768
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:46,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to customers is they put in</font>

769
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,449
the type of breach and it tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

770
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,759
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> states attorney generals they have</font>

771
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:54,668
to notify because there's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

772
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,349
it would for any one person to

773
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:57,819
understand all the different legal

774
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:00,609
requirements this is making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look</font>

775
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,790
simple because there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really 55</font>

776
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:07,180
things here but it tells you when you

777
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,830
have to notify<font color="#CCCCCC"> are their civil or</font>

778
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,589
criminal penalties for not promptly

779
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:14,700
notifying i'm not sure what private

780
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:17,320
right of action is exemption for

781
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,480
encrypted personal info so there's one

782
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,910
state which doesn't exempt District of

783
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,589
Columbia doesn't exempt the if the

784
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:27,339
personal info was encrypted you still

785
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:30,130
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a notification is there an</font>

786
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:31,180
exemption for criminal investigations so

787
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,910
if there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> criminal investigation</font>

788
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,930
going on you don't have to report it and

789
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,690
then some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these states have</font>

790
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,549
exemptions for immaterial breaches which

791
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,010
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one hundred percent sure what</font>

792
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:48,820
that means but you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

793
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:50,200
very fragmented so even though you know

794
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,500
we think it's a good idea to even

795
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:59,348
disclose PII breaches it they aren't

796
00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:01,180
always disclosed in every state so the

797
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:03,280
breach disclosure is really to notify

798
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,770
the people who is compromised no

799
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,619
requirement to to disclose the root

800
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:13,480
cause so that can remain secret so

801
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:15,700
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the NTSB the the agency the</font>

802
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,970
law said that you know when a plane

803
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:22,089
crashed it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reported that the</font>

804
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:24,160
plane crashed so you know plane tail

805
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:26,920
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crashed at this date and</font>

806
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,109
that was it right that's essentially

807
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,130
what we have it's just a notification

808
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:34,779
that that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there was a data</font>

809
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,810
breach and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the end</font>

810
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,569
of the story that's it if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> asks</font>

811
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:43,690
how did the plane crash you know I have

812
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:45,609
a plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like that or I you know I</font>

813
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,650
follow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same procedures as that pilot</font>

814
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:49,930
we fly in the same weather how did it

815
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:52,060
crash<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I want to know because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

816
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,770
could help me and there was no

817
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,480
information there you just said that

818
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah no they don't have to disclose any</font>

819
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,349
of that we just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disclose that</font>

820
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:01,000
the incident happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have to</font>

821
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:05,230
we have to disclose anything that you

822
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,730
might might take away and learn from so

823
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,740
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what we have right now</font>

824
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,140
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these data breach disclosure</font>

825
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:14,680
laws and all the information sharing

826
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:17,410
that that the government talks so so

827
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:21,430
much about and so hopeful that's going

828
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:24,700
to help us so I looked at two recent

829
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:28,540
incidents that happened drupal just a

830
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,848
few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically what</font>

831
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,819
Drupal says is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ross declined to name the</font>

832
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:35,410
third party responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the flaw</font>

833
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:37,150
saying only that the company has worked

834
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the software vendor to confirm the</font>

835
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,099
known vulnerability which has been

836
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:43,869
publicly disclosed we will wait we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

837
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,710
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> investigating and will share more</font>

838
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:49,750
detail when it's appropriate which

839
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,030
usually means never I see these

840
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,650
statements all the time and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

841
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow up maybe they will you know a</font>

842
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">month from now I'm like is it</font>

843
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,270
appropriate yet a year for not is it

844
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,710
appropriate yet and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> plenty of</font>

845
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,570
breaches that this is the kind of

846
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,220
statement that comes out and it's

847
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:07,900
r it is closed they say yeah we're going

848
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:09,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it after the investigation so you</font>

849
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,140
know if you're running that third-party

850
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:14,070
piece of software maybe you know maybe

851
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a website just like drupal.org</font>

852
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:19,360
maybe you're running that piece of

853
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">software to be kind of nice to know what</font>

854
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:26,790
it was and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fix</font>

855
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">available and then the Federal Reserve</font>

856
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:32,200
earlier this year this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what their</font>

857
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,300
statement was the Federal Reserve<font color="#CCCCCC"> System</font>

858
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">is aware that information was obtained</font>

859
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:41,310
by exploiting a temporary vulnerability

860
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:43,210
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website vendor product I mean</font>

861
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,140
they're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying there was a</font>

862
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:48,940
vulnerability somewhere on their system

863
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,500
in a vendor product but that's all

864
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,180
they're telling us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they they're</font>

865
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,650
very happy to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exposure was fixed</font>

866
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:59,910
shortly after discovery and is no longer

867
00:38:53,650 --> 00:39:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">an issue I did some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> digging around and</font>

868
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:06,009
people seem to think it's it's it's a

869
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">cold fusion vulnerability that there was</font>

870
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:12,400
a there was a known patch available for

871
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:14,890
and cold fusion sites and notoriously

872
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,550
bad for staying up to date with the

875
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,430
major breach like this and say you know

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,259
it was cold fusion was the problem

877
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,839
there's so many vulnerabilities in it

878
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,460
it's hard for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proper</font>

saying you know here is a recommendation

for people who have cold fusion systems

vulnerabilities pets a known

vulnerability and once it's patched why

890
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:01,330
not tell everyone about it but there's

891
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,760
this culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of secrecy so that no one</font>

892
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,560
is able to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from failures even when</font>

893
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,080
the breach comes out how many breaches

894
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,120
like drupal<font color="#CCCCCC"> and federal reserve breaches</font>

895
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,640
are happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now that will never</font>

896
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,680
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the light of day because the</font>

897
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,279
organization because it never became

898
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,410
public

899
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,210
the the Federal Reserve became public

900
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:22,200
because it was a hacktivist that posted

901
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,730
the information up on pastebin or

902
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:28,240
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was on some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese paceman</font>

903
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,500
I think it was which you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot</font>

904
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,700
harder for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Federal Reserve to take</font>

905
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:38,490
down and the Drupal we know about

906
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:40,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they reset everyone's password</font>

907
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,330
but of course as other incidents that

908
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,400
happen all the time that don't become

909
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,080
public so even when they're public we're

910
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">not getting information imagine the ones</font>

911
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:54,009
that aren't even have to be disclosed so

912
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,410
I went and looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the 6 biggest</font>

913
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:59,200

914
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:02,049
a nice compendium of six biggest

915
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,149

required to disclose this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the people</font>

00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,460
who were victims and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey the</font>

937
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,080
system was supposed to be a back-end

938
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,780

authentication right and access control

942
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:14,200
so this seemed like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a complete</font>

943
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,759
screw-up right so they the information

949
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,060
changed some rule

950
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,620
they exposed it so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

951
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,290
change control you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need better access</font>

952
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,960

learn anything you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,210
there's other people processing credit

they're covering their butt South

975
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:37,270
so employees with access couldn't just

976
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,120
throw it on a hard drive or eat or email

977
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:42,190
it and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was disclosed</font>

978
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:49,690
because it was health information then

985
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:10,629
here there was a potential to learn from

986
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:12,940
these incidents but what we didn't but

987
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,110
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things out there and</font>

988
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,610
it's interesting that it's not coming

999

the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very heavily biased</font>

00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,529
two credit cards so that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bias is</font>

1016
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:44,380
clearly there the other problem is you

1017
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:47,410
know it's only summary data so we only

1018
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:50,440
know things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it was known</font>

1019
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:52,920
vulnerabilities attacked or it was you

1020
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">know pass passwords that were guests</font>

1021
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,120
it's it's only summary we never get like

1022
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:01,600
the product name right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get the</font>

1023
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:05,500
organization or any details around it so

1024
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:08,140
you know looking at the NTSB imagine if

1025
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:11,680
their reports where oh yeah this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11</font>

1026
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,029
planes crashed due to metal fatigue you

1027
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,220
know because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only summary data</font>

1028
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:18,310
that's what they reported on and that's

1029
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,810
all that came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of that report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1030
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,340
know as the someone who flies a lot I'd

1031
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,400
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of want to know which type of</font>

1032
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:26,080
planes had that metal fatigue so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1033
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,910
say hey these manufacturers dealing with

1034
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,680
this problem you know they taking them

1035
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,500
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service they getting them fixed</font>

1036
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,089
before putting them back in there's no

1037
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,220
way to follow up on that there's no way

1038
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,220
to know which is the summary information

1039
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:47,890
and one of the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big problems I</font>

1040
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">see is the root cause data is weak which</font>

1041
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,930
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn</font>

1042
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,220
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very general it's not specific</font>

1043
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,690
at all here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1044
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,790
two examples of two of the better ones

1045
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:00,580
out there this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the web</font>

1046
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:03,460
hacking incident database where whenever

1047
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:07,779
there's a public web web web<font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

1048
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:09,760
breach they record what what happened

1049
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:13,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest category thirty-seven</font>

1050
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,520
percent is unreported so with public

1051
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,529
information as we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes you</font>

1052
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,910
don't you don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cause was</font>

1053
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,609
and they have twenty-seven percent

1054
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:24,730
sequel injection 23 percent's denial of

1055
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:29,279
service and a lot down in the one

1056
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,280
one-percent range this is actually from

1057
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:36,940
data loss DB and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't read it but the</font>

1058
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,868
biggest category a<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty two percent is</font>

1059
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:45,700
hack it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a hack that doesn't really</font>

1060
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:47,680
help us I can't fix that<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily and then</font>

1061
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,118
this one you can't read<font color="#CCCCCC"> at nine percent</font>

1062
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,598
just as it was something in the was a

1063
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,099
web web web was the problem and then

1064
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,839
there's all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> little details here of</font>

1065
00:47:54,099 --> 00:48:00,970
the laptop was<font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen you know you know</font>

1066
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:03,670
the tape was stolen which are pretty

1067
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:07,060
specific but the stuff that's around you

1068
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,950
know a technical vulnerability is very

1069
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,349
vague and it's not you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> data lot</font>

1070
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,598
db's fault they're using the information

1071
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:15,490
that's publicly available it's that no

1072
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,720
one is recording this information or no

1073
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:22,209
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> required</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to report the details so</font>

1074
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,549
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to learn to be actionable</font>

1075
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,619
with that data it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of interesting</font>

1076
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:30,310
you know that's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hacking going</font>

1077
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:32,080
on do do do better hack prevention stuff

1078
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:35,859
that's that's what you take away from

1079
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:38,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so then I put these charts next to</font>

1080
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:41,049
each other and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

1081
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten-year span and that's a 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year span</font>

1082
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:47,770
but you see that data breaches are

1083
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:53,710
accelerating or at least growing kind of

1084
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:55,630
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that air accidents were happened</font>

1085
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wonder</font>

1086
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,740
is that chart just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to keep going</font>

1087
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:03,790
up and up and up are the things that

1088
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:07,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing to manage incidents going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1089
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:16,420
change that the slope of

1090
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:21,288
chart so my thought after learning about

1091
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:23,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know how the NTSB worked I changed</font>

1092
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:25,219
transportation to to cyber because cyber

1093
00:49:23,989 --> 00:49:26,989
you have to have it's got to be named

1094
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:29,690
cyber if it's the government if we put

1095
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:31,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">infosec in there or computer risk or</font>

1096
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,680
assurance you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would just be</font>

1097
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:36,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">leaving the room but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we put Cyber in</font>

1098
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,979
there hey a cyber safety board yeah that

1099
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:42,349
sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's got some legs so the</font>

1100
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:45,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the model of the NTSB</font>

1101
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:48,469
and make it mandatory that you have to

1102
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,449
report these incidents and there's a

1103
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:52,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">forum with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the details that you have</font>

1104
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:55,489
to fill in which means you actually have

1105
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:57,499
to gather that information and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1106
00:49:55,489 --> 00:50:00,109
put a narrative in there about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

1107
00:49:57,499 --> 00:50:01,999
know what what happened and it should

1108
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:03,499
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendation in there the</font>

1109
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,868
person who responds to the incident

1110
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:08,089
might if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an expert enough is</font>

1111
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:10,130
probably in a great place to make a

1112
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,420
recommendation so in all of a sudden

1113
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,930
we're going to have recommendations

1114
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:17,690
about how to stop different root causes

1115
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:20,690
and the goal would to make actionable

1116
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:23,359
knowledge right things that we can

1117
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:26,569
actually act on now I know businesses

1118
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,900
are going to want anonymity right there

1119
00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:32,150
is anonymity with with communicable

1120
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:35,959
diseases not for the doctor but for the

1121
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:37,279
patient so the doctor has to put his or

1122
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:39,109
her name there but the patient is

1123
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:40,789
anonymous but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a plane goes down</font>

1124
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:42,558
that's not anonymous we know who the

1125
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:44,449
pilot is we know who the owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plate</font>

1126
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,099
is we know who the manufacturer is we

1127
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:47,239
know where it happened what time it

1128
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:50,299
happened we know all those details

1129
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:52,579
that's that's not anonymous<font color="#E5E5E5"> Consumer</font>

1130
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:55,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Product Safety we certainly know what</font>

1131
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:59,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the product is and what the failure is</font>

1132
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:00,709
so it seems in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the computer realm</font>

1133
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:04,759
everyone's going to want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1134
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:07,459
anonymous reporter and if businesses

1135
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:08,869
were able to keep that anonymity and

1136
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:10,609
that was something that I had to trade

1137
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:13,640
off in return<font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting the details I</font>

1138
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:17,569
would do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just like with the</font>

1139
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:20,660
consumer safety I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1140
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:23,000
the the the vendors

1141
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,848
certainly that of the products that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1142
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,559
that failed if there were any should

1143
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:32,990
certainly be part of that report or we

1144
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:34,700
can't really learn from it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font>

1145
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:37,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we can we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

1146
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,779
so I've min application security so

1147
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,730
something near and dear to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> heart is</font>

1148
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,210
learning what classes of application

1149
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:46,640
vulnerabilities are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked</font>

1150
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:50,119
because that way we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> prioritize what</font>

1151
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:53,480
we fix right a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of organizations just</font>

1152
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:55,339
fix sequel injection right because they

1153
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,890
hear in the news sequel injections used

1154
00:51:55,339 --> 00:52:00,759
here sequel injections use there that

1155
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:03,348
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be true we don't really have any</font>

1156
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,270
consistent empirical evidence because

1157
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:08,000
it's all anecdotal it's all who ever

1158
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:11,119
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reported on or was required</font>

1159
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to report what's the next thing you fix</font>

1160
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,589
after sequel injection I don't know

1161
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:16,940
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably a second most prevalent</font>

1162
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:18,470
thing that's attacked but we really

1163
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:23,150
don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is so we can't</font>

1164
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:24,500
prioritize effectively we could learn

1165
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,900
the exploit rate of known

1166
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,539
vulnerabilities right people try to

1167
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,059
gather this by you know looking looking

1168
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:34,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and looking for</font>

1169
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:37,670
certain signatures of attacks we would

1170
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:39,259
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tax which</font>

1171
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,299
everyone seems to report a tax all the

1172
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,849
time because<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks are easy to it's</font>

1173
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:46,190
easy it's easy to understand attacks you

1174
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:48,200
see this all the time we were you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1175
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">came out the power company said we're</font>

1176
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,879
attack three thousand times a day well

1177
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,950
that's that's meaningless because if the

1178
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,010
attack isn't successful it's totally

1179
00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:00,589
meaningless right so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

1180
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">know when the vulnerabilities are</font>

1181
00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:06,558
actually exploited that's what we can

1182
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:09,559
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand how to improve and how</font>

1183
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,210
to prioritize maybe a lot of

1184
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,869
vulnerabilities are really trivially

1185
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:18,410
blocked but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see it</font>

1186
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:19,670
really high attack rates well another

1187
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:22,368
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't really understand is</font>

1188
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:26,029
non-regulated data and non-regulated

1189
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:27,890
entities when they get compromised the

1190
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:29,720
only visibility we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when there's</font>

1191
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,308
a law compelling people to disclose and

1192
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's almost regular almost always</font>

1193
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:35,079
regulated data so as all these

1194
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:39,230
compromises of

1195
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:41,660
of you know hacktivist type compromises

1196
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,549
espionage type compromises where they're

1197
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,098
stealing intellectual property there's

1198
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:48,288
no requirement to report those so we

1199
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:50,180
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if those attack methodologies</font>

1200
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:56,329
are different in any way we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1201
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:57,710
any visibility into that so I couldn't

1202
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:59,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">help but put a couple slides in from</font>

1203
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:03,109
Vera<font color="#CCCCCC"> code state of software security</font>

1204
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:08,359
report just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the data might</font>

1205
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:11,319
be used if we had actual data about what

1206
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:14,359
are the root causes out there so this is

1207
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:17,750
from about 20,000 applications at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Verico</font>

1208
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:19,369
tested over the last 18 months these<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1209
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:23,180
four different languages<font color="#CCCCCC"> ColdFusion</font>

1210
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:27,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">php.net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Java this is the prevalence</font>

1211
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:29,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these flaws so how many applications</font>

1212
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,779
are affected by one or more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel</font>

1213
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:35,990
injection so you can see for cold fusion

1214
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:38,539
about seventy two percent or so of cold

1215
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:42,078
fusion applications have sequel

1216
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:44,329
injection it's a lot better for PHP net

1217
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:48,140
and Java where we see it's around thirty

1218
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:50,270
thirty to thirty three percent so we

1219
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:53,029
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vulnerabilities</font>

1220
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:56,270
that are latent and in the in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1221
00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:59,049
average application<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there cross-site</font>

1222
00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:02,270
scripting a lot higher for everybody

1223
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">coldfusion again stands out crypto</font>

1224
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:06,349
issues you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see that dotnet and Java</font>

1225
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:09,200
do actually is more crypto errors in

1226
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:10,579
those applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> than cold fusion and</font>

1227
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,410
PHP I think that's because it's more

1228
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:13,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">abstract away from the developer that's</font>

1229
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:17,629
less ways for them to shoot themselves

1230
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:19,339
in the foot and then directory traversal

1231
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:21,500
and command injection so this is this is

1232
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:24,078
what you know if you haven't tested your

1233
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,359
application or you test your application

1234
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the first time this is what you're</font>

1235
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:30,069
likely to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likelihood that</font>

1236
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:32,450
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these and</font>

1237
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:35,150
then we went and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked and said what</font>

1238
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:38,058
our developers actually fixing what our

1239
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:39,650
developers after their first test what

1240
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:43,400
are they fixing and then they send it to

1241
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:45,950
us for a retest and it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1242
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,309
variable it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and it's actually amazing</font>

1243
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:51,770
how little is actually fixed

1244
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:56,299
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my chart isn't showing up</font>

1245
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:59,180
there what was the so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was command</font>

1246
00:55:56,299 --> 00:56:02,299
injection directory traversal and were

1247
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:04,490
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> to directory traversal you</font>

1248
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:06,619
know it's barely getting fixed like

1249
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are you know just ignoring that</font>

1250
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:10,819
one altogether sequel injection what you

1251
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:16,009
see is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously a bad problem</font>

1252
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:17,720
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being fixed by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cold fusion but you</font>

1253
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:21,589
know dotnet developers are only fixing

1254
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:25,098
eighteen percent so what if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able</font>

1255
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:27,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to prioritize the classes of</font>

1256
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:32,089
vulnerability that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> being attacked</font>

1257
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:34,910
we had real data to show exactly what is

1258
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:36,619
the likelihood that a vulnerability is

1259
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:39,649
going to be exploited of a certain class

1260
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:44,240
and we gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information to the</font>

1261
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:46,670
developers and said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty-three</font>

1262
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent of applications with sequel</font>

1263
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:51,530
injection will be compromised within you

1264
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:53,059
know six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know meantime to</font>

1265
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:55,940
compromise or something like that that

1266
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:58,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">might actually change their behavior</font>

1267
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,190
they might actually change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1268
00:56:58,279 --> 00:57:03,200
they're looking at fixing problems

1269
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:05,329
because it wouldn't all be anecdotal and

1270
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,700
oh yeah the oh it's in the OAuth top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1271
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:09,230
and some people are saying it's like no

1272
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,118
this is exactly how many sites were

1273
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:16,160
compromised this year with sequel

1274
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:18,440
injection exactly and you'd almost be

1275
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,868
negligent if you didn't fix it if you

1276
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,309
knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a certain percentage</font>

1277
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:24,920
we're going to be attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> within six</font>

1278
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:29,240
months and compromised right now

1279
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:31,029
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say I don't know I I don't</font>

1280
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,250
know if I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to fix that I</font>

1281
00:57:31,029 --> 00:57:36,349
think it's a low priority we have other

1282
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,900
things we need to do because there's no

1283
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:41,359
hard data no one can be negligent for

1284
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:44,779
anything if there's no known root causes

1285
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,910
I don't have to fix anything because

1286
00:57:44,779 --> 00:57:48,500
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's not it's the data</font>

1287
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:53,270
the hard data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there and that's</font>

1288
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,710
the state where we're in so I originally

1289
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:57,259
started to have these thoughts when the

1290
00:57:54,710 --> 00:58:01,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">national data breach reporting law was</font>

1291
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:04,400
was being talked about in

1292
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:05,420
wanted to put in some input to say you

1293
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's good to make it</font>

1294
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,490
consistent across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the states but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

1295
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:12,200
more data reported we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1296
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:14,118
the model like these other government

1297
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,029
agencies are doing where there's

1298
