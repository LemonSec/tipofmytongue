<font color="#E5E5E5">alright well well go ahead and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

2
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,340
started that way we can go ahead and get

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,990
finished my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hole and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the</font>

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,680
director of a cert which is arbor

networks security research organization

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,030
i've been at arbor now for a little over

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,550
a year prior to that 15 years in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IPS</font>

8
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:45,470
industry but we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that over</font>

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:47,599
drinks want to talk a bit about modern

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,160
threat motives and it just so happens

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,860
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i work at a company that is</font>

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,750
heavily involved in DDoS mitigation i'm

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,339
going to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos along the way as some</font>

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,489
of these examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not all the</font>

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,239
time but the mode of the motives here

16
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:04,069
which can see they butchered on the

17
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:07,130
schedule there is actually the more

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:08,839
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of this talk and I'll in</font>

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,699
this talk with cyber warfare so that

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,880
we're all sufficiently worked up and

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,619
ready for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinks that we deserve</font>

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,420
so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

23
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,640
just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of history how did we</font>

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,290
get to where we are so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this new</font>

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,080
threat landscape look like you could

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,420
call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it modern</font>

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,298
whatever works for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just want to</font>

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">give come to a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base lines here</font>

29
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,010
right most of these you know but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,710
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a couple of comments were</font>

31
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:40,460
defenses is pretty important I know all

32
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,710
enjoy making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a baby I find firewalls to</font>

33
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">be interesting we had 65,000 perfectly</font>

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,600
usable ports we brought that down to

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,039
roughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> three and now they tell you you</font>

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,119
need new firewalls to understand all the

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,010
applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're funneling</font>

38
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:58,939
through those three ports whatever does

39
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,770
it for you see those so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is</font>

40
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,419
attackers know that you have defenses

41
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,560
right they you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been</font>

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,150
saying all day long right that's what

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,189
compliance has brought the attackers

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,560
know they're there obviously we're all

45
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:12,260
still getting owned so there's there's

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,450
more work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I think probably the</font>

47
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,170
most important part for me my entire

48
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,268
life being the infosec industry is the

49
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,609
geopolitical aspect I've followed

50
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,310
politics also for most of my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

51
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,110
find the fact that it used to be I would

52
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,050
pull out my you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite websites</font>

53
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,290
you know the dark

54
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,580
few weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc and that's how I would</font>

55
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,090
find out what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in our industry</font>

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,010
now I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the BBC that's where i</font>

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,950
find that anything that's happening in

58
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,179
the world is now reflected in the threat

59
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,950
landscape and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if you haven't</font>

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,750
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that conclusion yet you're being</font>

61
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,489
a little naive but there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be plenty</font>

62
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,290
of things during this conversation where

63
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll likely disagree with me on things</font>

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,480
so that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one the</font>

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,429
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is certainly changed we</font>

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,170
obviously have mobile which we've heard

67
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">about today we've got cloud we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta be</font>

68
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,549
PN's Wi-Fi you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially is now you know the</font>

70
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,990
extension of your network and so the

71
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,740
network itself is fundamentally changed

72
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,870
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iod as we mentioned</font>

73
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,260
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course is applications and</font>

74
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,640
content and then we do have legacy

75
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,070
infrastructure and you all know this

76
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,160
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard a talk from HD more late</font>

77
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,750
last year where he attempted to scan the

78
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,390
majority of internet and it wasn't

79
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,220
surprising to me how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nt4 machines</font>

80
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,829
he stumbled across it was surprising to

81
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,739
me how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many NT 35 machines he stumbled</font>

82
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,510
across they are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there the</font>

83
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,560
number thankfully wasn't large but they

84
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so how and you know so</font>

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,510
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what's changed or what</font>

86
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,580
stayed the same in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

87
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">these will know about right</font>

88
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,370
vulnerabilities have been with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

89
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,310
very long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk up in a</font>

90
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,470
wawa talks about those tomorrow botnets

91
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,450
malware etc etc right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the threats</font>

92
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,540
themselves haven't changed so

93
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,250
dramatically the maturity the commodity

94
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,280
aspect of these threats has changed

95
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,900
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what has changed</font>

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially over the last three years I</font>

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,269
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say and what is this modern or</font>

98
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,060
advanced landscape we are in is the

99
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,859
motivation we are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to cyber</font>

100
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,390
crime that has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around now you know</font>

101
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,760
since mid 2000s at least but hacktivism

102
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,128
is fairly new compared to other things

103
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,639
apt fairly new and

104
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:37,289
at least you say this not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any of</font>

105
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,929
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are new whether it's apt or</font>

106
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:43,019
cyber warfare or even hacktivism what is

107
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:45,179
new is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average citizens visibility</font>

108
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,469
into these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so if you've</font>

109
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:48,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">been in the industry for a long time</font>

110
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:50,939
you've seen a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you always</font>

111
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,559
have you know war stories but my point

112
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,319
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the average citizen that is</font>

113
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,360
pulling up BBC now here's about these

114
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,309
terms and that change has really

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,239
happened over the last three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

116
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:04,679
so yes these things have been around but

117
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:06,448
i'd say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about them a lot more</font>

118
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:09,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">now all right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start with</font>

119
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,869
cyber crime this one actually is still a

120
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:16,199
bit fun it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for quite some</font>

121
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:17,879
time but the this is really the aspect

122
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,449
of the threat landscape that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite</font>

123
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,449
quite commoditized it's very cheap and

124
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:27,539
very easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the return</font>

125
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,999
on on this type of business is you know

126
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:32,068
changing all the time so what I want to

127
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is is kind of give you a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walkthrough</font>

128
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,679
if you wanted to build your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own but you</font>

129
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,699
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other words if you want to quit</font>

130
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">your job tomorrow and become a</font>

131
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:41,039
cybercriminal here's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a an</font>

132
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:42,179
example by example way to do it first

133
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually talked</font>

134
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:46,078
about Dee das for just a moment you can

135
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,360
see this example here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called a host</font>

136
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,550
booter this is actually a very good

137
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of what the majority of DDoS</font>

138
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,939
every day on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet looks like I</font>

139
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,249
know you hear lots of headlines saying

140
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,399
DDoS is getting bigger and badder and

141
00:05:56,249 --> 00:06:01,169
the attacks are gigantic an awful it's

142
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,089
mainly just because right any security

not these massive things most of your

<font color="#CCCCCC">DDoS activity is kids on xbox just like</font>

157
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,889
we were back in the 90s IRC somebody

158
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:37,449
says something you don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> or they're</font>

159
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,460
beating you at call of duty

160
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,650
it's pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get d dos all right</font>

161
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,270
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> websites this kind</font>

163
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,058
so this is the kind of pull that's used

164
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:49,419
for this and you'll notice one of the

165
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:50,379
tabs here says a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot builder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

166
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,900
so what you're going to do is you're

167
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,550
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take some some piece of malware</font>

168
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,589
such as this you can see there's only

169
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,180
one bot loaded in this they're generally

170
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,939
small it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take much to knock</font>

171
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,969
somebody off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of xbox not in this country</font>

172
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:06,669
anyway so you click on this builder tab

173
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:08,439
and this is another tool but i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

174
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,909
using this was an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font>

175
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,499
see here pretty easy right you put in

176
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:14,099
your version number what you want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">be called the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> port you want to go after</font>

178
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:21,479
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's all these check boxes</font>

here anti sandbox anti<font color="#CCCCCC"> vmware anti</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jobox</font>

180
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,248
so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are meant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all right do you</font>

181
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:29,169

182
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:31,120
detectable available etc right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again</font>

183
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,998
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the attackers are well</font>

aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have defenses in place</font>

185
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:38,110
sometimes they will attempt to evade you

186
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:39,969
sometimes they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because if you</font>

187
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,159
have a sandbox set up or you have some

188
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,089
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proxy setup and they know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

189
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,909
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this</font>

190
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:48,039
dissecting it they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't check that</font>

191
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:49,990
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it might get by easier if it's</font>

192
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,360
not trying to evade you just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

193
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,810
that is their<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright going back</font>

194
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,029
to the previous example that is a d

195
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,009
dodge tool but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually has a Firefox</font>

196
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:01,599
password stealer as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so this</font>

197
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,240
is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has fundamentally</font>

198
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,599
changed especially over the last several

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,669
years d<font color="#E5E5E5"> das has not it's changed from</font>

200
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,248
being what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most people think of</font>

201
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:14,620
as a networking problem right you think

202
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:15,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you know you think of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D Dawson and</font>

203
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,300
unfortunately people still think of

204
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:22,389
mafia boy and syn flood and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its way past</font>

205
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,240
that but in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of the</font>

206
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,620
DDoS related malware there are new

207
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,849
functionality and that's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

208
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,360
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlight to you today in</font>

209
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:33,429
this case steals Firefox passwords right

210
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,229
that happens all the time these got

211
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:38,439
collected posted up on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian form</font>

212
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,740
and sold pretty common cybercrime just

213
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,610
so happens that it was attached d Dawson

214
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:49,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have our malware built you</font>

215
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,710
know scary exe exe now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bypass</font>

216
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:53,800
that AV that we love

217
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,870
making fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult you</font>

218
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">just hire someone to do it so these guys</font>

219
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,660
twenty dollars per baat they will do

220
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,990
what they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crypt or service they</font>

221
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,060
can encrypt it custom<font color="#CCCCCC"> pack or whatever</font>

222
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,150
these guys know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to evade a be pretty</font>

223
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,130
easy just like any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us would go to one</font>

224
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the AP test sites these guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

225
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">exact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing they see what detected</font>

226
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,850
it what didn't and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your service</font>

227
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,890
pretty pretty simple so now we have our

228
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,690
malware now we have the ability to

229
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,350
bypass<font color="#CCCCCC"> AV now we need to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a botnet</font>

230
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,200
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to do that ourselves</font>

231
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,630
either so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have mr. Worf in</font>

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,910
Russia that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help us out he sells</font>

233
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,130
these a thousand at a time these are

234
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,579
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> loads and the load is essentially</font>

235
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">AMD owned box if you will right it's a</font>

236
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,170
box that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he owns but it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

237
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,780
malicious malware on it it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

238
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,250
empty in an empty malware container if

239
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,860
you will right and so he will sell these

240
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,360
to a thousand at a time you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here</font>

241
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,910
different pricing depending on the

242
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:00,880
geography<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia being the cheapest at $18</font>

243
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:01,930
a mix for 25 and without 50 now the

244
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,360
reason here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably pretty obvious</font>

245
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,819
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there are some companies that</font>

246
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,350
can afford to simply geo block if you're

247
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,790
not doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> business with say China or</font>

248
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,700
other countries you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just geo block</font>

249
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,829
and so that might affect you know the

250
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,070
usefulness of the button so for instance

251
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:21,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">take into account spam a lot of the spam</font>

252
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,830
came from Asia came from the US and of

253
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,740
course the whole point of spam getting

254
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,480
better over you know many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years was to</font>

255
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">move away from signatures and move</font>

256
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,440
towards reputation and so this famous

257
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,820
frigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well let's go to the</font>

258
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,730
one place<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody trusts let's go to</font>

259
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canada and so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your spam mail</font>

260
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,080
comes from Canada it's a more trusted IP

261
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:45,190
space and this pricing is a reflection

262
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:48,370
of that so now we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we can buy</font>

263
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,420
our loaders to load our new malware and

264
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,850
you can see in this case this is a dgaf

265
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,520
bot shop selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots for three cents</font>

266
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,250
each so that's three dollars per

267
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,970
thousand you could actually go buy a

268
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,899
thousand bots or more for

269
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,889
18 bucks sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for 30 make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 bucks</font>

270
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,750
pretty easy turn around you actually

271
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't have to do anything criminal old</font>

272
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,209
you just played the middleman and then

273
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,758
in the end what really happens of course

274
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,560
is the commoditization of cyber crime

275
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,680
and that's of course tying all these

276
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,439
things together so you need a cyber

277
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,800
toolkit that will allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

278
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:33,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything whether that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deed US banking</font>

279
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,219
fraud keylogging custom Packers whatever

280
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:37,350
the case might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and that's what we've</font>

281
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,519
seen over the years is these things just

282
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,529
getting better and better right just

283
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,750
just as every you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know vendor that's</font>

284
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:44,040
present here builds and releases new

285
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,230
software and it gets better over time

286
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,029
hopefully these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been doing</font>

287
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,050
this now for quite some time and of

288
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,889
course it's gotten better and better

289
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,649
over time and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also of course how</font>

290
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:57,420
they continue to make money<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

291
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:02,129
margins have gotten smaller over time as

292
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:05,819
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so we've got cybercrime out</font>

293
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,259
of the way let's move on to activism and

294
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,878
I won't spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of time on this</font>

295
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,860
mainly because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably all are</font>

296
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,389
quite familiar with anonymous I don't

297
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,160
want to beat a dead horse but want to

298
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:19,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">highlight a few things one being again</font>

299
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,850
the motivation right if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

300
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:26,129
read a fantastic piece on nutrition org

301
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,189
about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sue it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hilarious and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

302
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,389
list from that article in the old days

303
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:32,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the industry right we would always</font>

304
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,899
say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear somebody say they think</font>

305
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a hacker and this of course is</font>

306
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,089
where the massive pin testing industry

307
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,290
came from and so right we we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

308
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,720
like the hacker beat up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our own</font>

309
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,309
network and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got compliance</font>

310
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,410
and reports etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> etcetera and that's how</font>

311
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:48,629
we ended up to where we are of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

312
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,149
the point now is with anonymous with

313
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,279
activism it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely difficult to</font>

314
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">know who is attacking you and that's</font>

315
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,689
again why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stress the motivation right</font>

316
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,389
so it doesn't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter whether</font>

317
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,469
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these people you know a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

318
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">year old black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10th</font>

319
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,250
uncompromising any company or a military

320
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,079
contractor in Iraq none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

321
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,939
matters it's the motivation right so

322
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,130
what many enterprises have found

323
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:12,209
themselves and is you know are we going

324
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do anything that might upset</font>

325
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,248
anonymous

326
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,349
is our press release going to upset<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

327
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:21,829
our competitor is now getting d dose is

328
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:25,279
that a possible problem for us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

329
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:27,019
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about you know why might they</font>

330
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,290
be coming after us not necessarily who

331
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:32,509
they are because it's extremely

332
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,069
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course know who these</font>

333
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,480
people are at this point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet is</font>

334
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:40,969
a big place and anonymous is very very

335
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,990
geographically dispersed<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

336
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a couple incidents here this one in</font>

337
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,939
2008 was the big kind of coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for</font>

338
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,339
anonymous if you will first high-profile

339
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:54,498
attack of course it was involving Tom

340
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,679
Cruise and Scientology so not many of us

341
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:59,899
really worried so much about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I think</font>

342
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody should do a what infosec loves</font>

343
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">about anonymous because certainly this</font>

344
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:08,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the Westboro Baptist Church would</font>

345
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably be high on the list but you</font>

346
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:11,990
know that that was kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

347
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,339
this is something different we haven't

348
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,199
seen right things really started to

349
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">change in the late 2000s and and this</font>

350
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,459
was a big part of that now they've used

351
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,889
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tools over time I'm</font>

352
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:24,679
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

353
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:26,839
low-orbit ion cannon very popular has

354
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:30,049
been around for quite some time you can

355
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:34,339
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> some different options here URL or</font>

356
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:36,980
an IP what you want the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

357
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,199
tool to say fairly easy you know early

358
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,389
on anonymous had pretty decent skills

359
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,998
right it was a smaller group technical

360
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,740
people that knew what they were doing

361
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:48,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">but as time progressed they needed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

362
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,119
get things to a point where anyone could

363
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,759
could be a part of the movement and

364
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:55,610
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened drastically over time</font>

365
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,639
and that's that's kind of where this

366
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,769
came from this was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I did it</font>

367
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,829
session up in New York with a bunch of

368
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:07,220
csos and CISOs and they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> said this</font>

369
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:09,498
event Operation Payback was really the

370
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,029
event that<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought d das too light for</font>

371
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:13,939
them right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what made them pay</font>

372
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:16,610
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> adidas made them question what</font>

373
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:19,219
they were doing is a company and really

374
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,970
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know I think reinvented d</font>

375
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,709
das if you will and this was because of

376
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,720
course they could essentially build an

377
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:27,229
opt-in botnet right anybody could

378
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
volunteer

379
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,860
right if you're a housewife at home

380
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,300
ironing clothes you could still be a

381
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,450
part of a DDoS attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's</font>

382
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,099
that's a definitely a change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

383
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,470
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> different we had not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

384
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,390
before so how did they do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> well they</font>

385
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,160
took tools like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lloyd and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made them</font>

386
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,250
a whole lot easier this is probably my

387
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,199
my favorite loike variant we just heard

388
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,170
all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript this is developed</font>

389
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,520
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript extremely easy to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

390
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,740
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see pretty much just plug in your</font>

391
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,770
target whether you want to append

392
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,180
anything your message and you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

393
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,240
fantastic thing about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

394
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,640
JavaScript of course is one it runs in a

395
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,040
web browser so anybody can go to a URL

396
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,850
load it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so that's nice and</font>

397
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,860
easy you can already have these points

398
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,570
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool populated making it even</font>

399
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,610
easier and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can of course even</font>

400
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,680
automate it so you can have the

401
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript automatically run you could</font>

402
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,819
even send this out as spam and recruit

403
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,380
people to be a part of the DDoS attack

404
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,870
that of course never<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to be if</font>

405
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,540
they were went and clicked on the link

406
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,610
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really brought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the d das</font>

407
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,680
tools kind of down to earth for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

408
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,180
average person that could just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

409
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,729
website rather than having to download a

410
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,069
tool from the suspicious anonymous that

411
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,050
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got hooked up with and made</font>

412
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,910
things quite easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this allowed them</font>

413
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,270
to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> start getting a lot of folks</font>

414
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,839
involved now what have we seen from

415
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,400
anonymous since Operation Payback

416
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,120
obviously that was about WikiLeaks

417
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:58,840
Julian Assange really the last big thing

418
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,300
we saw related to Julian Assange was

419
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,680
last year where he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in Europe and</font>

420
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,599
they were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about extradition and</font>

421
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,079
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course anonymous got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upset about that</font>

422
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,699
went after a bunch of UK websites and I

423
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's there's people here</font>

424
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,640
that following up as much closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than me</font>

425
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,879
I would say this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the last</font>

426
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,460
big full on anonymous movement you had

427
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,550
where you had really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a worldwide entity</font>

428
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,880
coming together to help what you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

429
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,740
is a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> fragmented type of</font>

430
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,270
operations and that's the issue that's

431
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,240
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what's changed I think</font>

432
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,790
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last year this anything having</font>

433
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,260
to do with WikiLeaks and Assange you can

434
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,860
get a lot of anons involved in that kind

435
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,090
of

436
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,110
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you another tool here</font>

437
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,370
because this one is is a bit more

438
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,389
feature-rich if you will you can see a

439
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,270
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types of settings here</font>

440
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:53,160
port use proxy all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

441
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,410
you've got your IRC server here that you

442
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,970
can go into botnet mode you can point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

443
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,289
to different things and the best part of

444
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,970
this is you have what they call packet

445
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,590
blaster which allows you to customize

446
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,150
the packets that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

447
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,309
right so if you want to screw with the

448
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,679
headers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the payload in any kind of</font>

449
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:10,770
different way this gave the technical

450
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,559
folks down in Brazil the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

451
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,970
really customize the needles to whatever

452
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,070
whatever their needs are and you see

453
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite often depending on what</font>

454
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,200
geography you're out you're in in the

455
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,730
world the tools might be different and

456
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,700
you saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that quite a bit in some of the</font>

457
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,470
recent operations this this is what I

458
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,330
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Anonymous has been doing the</font>

459
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,159
last year a lot of political oriented

460
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,010
stuff that is is more local in nature

461
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so at this point you know you</font>

462
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,559
had the canada canadian election the

463
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">mexico election was a big target that</font>

464
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,010
was successfully defended dominican

republic russia ukraine south korea i

466
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,090
would say at this point if there's an

467
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">election in the you know world Anonymous</font>

468
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,908
has probably involved somehow someway

469
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:59,850
generally using d dos it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

470
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:01,380
certainly certainly a very popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

471
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,469
easy way for them to get involved and

472
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,820
trying you know if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape change at</font>

473
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,270
least get some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of message across</font>

474
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know what their what their</font>

475
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:15,150
agenda is and so to that point you know

476
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">what have we seen lately of Israel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

477
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,860
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good examples of more regional</font>

478
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,408
type of activity things that sound very

479
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,168
scary you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a ton of buzz</font>

480
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,580
around op USA lots of articles written

481
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,820
and then of course it kind of came and

482
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,668
went the issue of course is that there's

483
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of anonymous in America you know</font>

484
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:37,049
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anons we're like this is</font>

485
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:40,740
ridiculous why are we do go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after this</font>

486
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:42,918
particular country right with Israel

487
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,600
Israel gets attacked every day

488
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,909
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to talk about cyber</font>

489
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,649
warfare that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> country to start I</font>

490
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,210
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were sweating anonymous</font>

491
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:53,090
given what they have to put up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

492
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to day so but this is the kind of stuff</font>

493
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,799
you see now so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

494
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,230
pastebin scraper and start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

495
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,559
pound off you can watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> this all the</font>

496
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,950
time and it's pretty regular but most of

497
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,809
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be website defacement</font>

498
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,539
and generally credential information

499
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:14,330
dumps to get anonymous to do a really

500
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:17,690
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> ddos you really have to upset a</font>

501
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:20,359
large group<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them to do it at this</font>

502
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">point I say that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something bad</font>

503
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,379
will happen but if you're going put you

504
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,869
know if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at those say the</font>

505
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:29,869
last year most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their activity has</font>

506
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:34,039
been more regional or more pop-oriented

507
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:35,928
like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright moving on to the next</font>

508
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">topic here is competitive take out this</font>

509
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:41,149
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has not gotten a lot</font>

510
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:43,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of coverage really until just</font>

511
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:45,229
recently but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually again one</font>

512
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,590
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most common things that actually</font>

513
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:51,379
happens in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ddos world and it just it</font>

514
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,269
it doesn't come out as often for some

515
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:55,879
reason the press doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover it very</font>

516
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:57,710
much and it just kind of comes and goes

517
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,869
it's also very popular in other regions

518
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,369
as well happens a lot in Southeast Asia

519
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,918
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you a couple</font>

520
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:07,220
examples that are here one at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least from</font>

521
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,559
the states so seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kinds of</font>

522
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,850
advertisements are pretty easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I</font>

523
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,668
mean you can literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> just google them</font>

524
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,498
they'll pop right up if you spend any

525
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:18,739
time on hack<font color="#E5E5E5"> forums or anything like</font>

526
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:20,480
that these are all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dan</font>

528
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,039
covers quite a bit of these this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

529
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,489
great example from about a year ago

530
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,408
using dirt jumper<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 typical stuff here</font>

531
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:33,320
right he's going to advertise you know

532
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:34,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">sin floods get floods post floods etc</font>

533
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,749
etc and then of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you get your</font>

534
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:42,399
pricing pretty darn cheap and obviously

535
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:44,509
until recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepting Liberty Reserve</font>

536
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:48,109
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be quite a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few examples of</font>

537
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:49,789
that here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is very very</font>

538
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:52,999
typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what you see in the old days</font>

539
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:54,150
they would advertise the size of the

540
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:56,100
botnet

541
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,710
maybe some of the bandwidth relay to the

542
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,929
the botnet but it's really come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

543
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,970
service right so as these services have

544
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,120
gotten more commoditized it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

545
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,500
you know supporting you as the customer

546
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,149
you know etc etc right<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are they</font>

547
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,960
going to win your business over the

548
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,820
zillion other<font color="#E5E5E5"> neato services it exists</font>

549
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,380
this slide is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so you all can</font>

550

take a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and</font>

551

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:26,070
right nobody left actually this is a

553
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,810
great design<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple of what you often see</font>

of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they're really trying to</font>

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,510
know you get the results<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want and</font>

565
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,159
the support is there etc so you know

566
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,470
that is really where they try and

567
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,350
differentiate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and set their services</font>

568
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,900
apart so an example of a competitive

569
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,959
take out this is a really interesting

570
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun because this guy is actually a</font>

571
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,950
serious big-time businessman in Russia

572
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,940
he's got his own Wikipedia entry it's

573
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:12,690
pretty fascinating Pavel<font color="#CCCCCC"> brew brew this</font>

574
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,160
ski he is the CEO of chrono pay he's

575
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,790
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business guy in Russia since I</font>

576
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,560
think he was 18 and he had been

577
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:23,250
suspected of being involved in sketchy

578
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,169
activity it's Russia but he had never

579
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,610
really done anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

580
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,400
FSB was like all right we got to go

581
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,620
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy and tell his company and</font>

582
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of his competitors went in on a bid</font>

583
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think for an airline to be the payment</font>

584
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,050
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know typical you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

585
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is similar to say Liberty Reserve</font>

586
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,280
or PayPal in Russia and so they wanted

587
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be the official payment for this this</font>

588
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,980
company and went on a bid and so story

589
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,320
goes of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they launch to d</font>

590
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,330
toss for quite some time at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week</font>

591
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,710
not two<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks to the point where his</font>

592
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,590
competitor could no longer process

593
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:02,930
payment obviously when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're bidding on</font>

594
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:05,220
a big deal this does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> look good and</font>

595
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,119
what's funny of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that neither</font>

596
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,619
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> won it</font>

597
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,738
another competitor won it and then the

598
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:14,609
FSB came after Pavel here and he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

599
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:16,409
jail for not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long but it just goes</font>

600
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:21,688
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show obviously he thinks a lot of</font>

601
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:23,639
himself in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture but there are</font>

602
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:25,199
there are several<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples out there</font>

603
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:27,238
where people have gotten busted more

604
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:29,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">often than not you don't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> busted why</font>

605
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:31,799
because these services are are very

606
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:35,549
anonymous it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them traced</font>

607
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,609
back to you another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example here of a</font>

608
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:40,139
dirt jumper 5d da service you can see

609
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:43,019
here again not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about sighs a</font>

610
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:45,418
botnet or bandwidth but websites that

611
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:47,339
they've attacked right so if I can prove

612
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you that I've taken these sites which</font>

613
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:51,569
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> well respected hack forums and and</font>

614
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:53,849
other you know types of websites right

615
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:56,699
obviously I can take down whoever you

616
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:58,889
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take down you can also of course</font>

617
00:24:56,699 --> 00:25:00,809
always tell many times what countries

618
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:06,059
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are from because here it says it</font>

619
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:08,158
is like hammer this one's great because

620
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,899
I don't pick on China too much in this

621
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,429
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is one of the few</font>

622
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:17,309
times I do this is a bot in China and

623
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:19,919
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually used back in 2010 to</font>

624
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,749
attack an industrial food processor and

625
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,489
this you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to look</font>

626
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:26,309
at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting areas of the</font>

00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:28,229
threat landscape that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you</font>

628

don't generally see here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> States</font>

629
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:34,469
Southeast Asia is absolutely fascinating

630
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,669
the you've got lots of countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

631
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:39,359
have not liked each other for long

632
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:42,199
periods of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and some countries have</font>

633
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:45,269
amazing bandwidth down to the home and

00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:47,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know they just don't care sometimes</font>

635
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:50,159
right so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty interesting place</font>

636
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,719
on the planet and you know industrial

637
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,519
food processor not exactly what you

00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:56,159
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect would be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos target but</font>

639
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,319
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened another great example here</font>

640
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,079
this happened in the state CEO of I

641
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:04,168
yousendit left did another startup

642
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:07,109
called fly upload and then hired someone

643
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:09,329
of course d das his old company he did

644
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:10,740
get busted he did go to jail I'm not

00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's still there but</font>

646
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:18,840
that that obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not a wise</font>

647
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:21,240
business choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more here</font>

648
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,559
this is another DDoS service and again

649
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can tell some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the language is</font>

650
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,960
always great here says the best way of

657
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,559

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,090
credit card so another great<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font>

707
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,010
something recent where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily</font>

708
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,629
purchase the Dido service you don't have

709
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,389
to do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cybercrime build your</font>

710
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:57,070
own botnet night type of activity all

711
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:59,129
right now on to the the buzzwords want

712
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:02,799
to talk just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about a</font>

713
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:06,340
campaign based d<font color="#CCCCCC"> das if you will and</font>

714
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">then in that up with cyber work so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

715
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,939
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be one of the biggest</font>

716
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,840
examples with sony Sony got hit of

717
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:16,299
course with very large d das some people

718
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,610
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it was lolz sec and those but</font>

719
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:22,840
the issue here when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting d</font>

720
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:24,639
dust is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a it's not an IT</font>

721
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,408
asset feed us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's what a</font>

722
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:28,449
lot of people think of again looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

723
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:30,370
it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network issue but it's very much</font>

724
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,769
a business asset boss right so if you

725
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:35,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about your website you know ww</font>

726
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:37,179
whatever that website consists of the

727
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,029
bandwidth coming down the service from

728
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:42,880
your isp all those obnoxious perimeter

729
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:45,549
devices you have then to the server then

730
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,039
to the application and so those those

731
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:51,010
make up your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website not just the box</font>

732
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:53,200
over in the corner and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single</font>

733
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:56,080
point along that way is a potential

734
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,450
bottleneck for ddos to occur and so in

735
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,639
sony's case the idea was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're</font>

736
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,049
being d dost it's been said that they

737
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:03,850
started pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out which</font>

738
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:06,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously lowered their ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

739
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:09,730
monitor and have some level of security

740
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:12,940
and obviously it's a huge drain on your

741
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:16,080
staff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's many that holiday</font>

742
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,789
a you know adidas on you know a

743
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,830
distraction right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's happened for a</font>

744
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:21,970
long time in the finance space the

745
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,370
launch of d das and then of course

746
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,960
they'll steal credit card numbers

747
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:27,159
financial data etc so it's it's pretty

748
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,450
tried and true

749
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,680
very typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right picking on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> China</font>

750
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:37,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">again because how can you not pick on</font>

751
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:39,850
China and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ET this is a common</font>

752
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:42,149
kind of remote access<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan just so</font>

753
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,949
happens that this one has d<font color="#E5E5E5"> dos ability</font>

754
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,660
we are commonly seeing this more and

755
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,330
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> just highlighting the fact that d</font>

756
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,330
das is now many times a feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

757
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,800
threat landscape and that includes

758
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:58,389
campaign you know intellectual property

759
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:02,230
theft type of activity now many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

760
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,400
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we talk about apt I think</font>

761
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the last time I say</font>

762
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh they like to think that these are</font>

763
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,040
very targeted custom really amazing type

764
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,540
types of malware but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

765
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,480
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case even this</font>

766
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,460
intellectual property theft is getting

767
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,960
more mature and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a great example</font>

768
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:25,270
here of a stream rat you can see here

769
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,900
you can buy it for 100 euros and this

770
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,980
malware was built specifically for a

771
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,070
campaign<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you're wanting to steal</font>

772
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:35,440
information not simple you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know kind of</font>

773
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,980
you know credentials or keylogging stuff

774
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,130
but really you know intellectual theft

775
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,930
you know at a very advanced level right

776
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,430
so you can buy this malware off the

777
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,220
shelf and then you can customize it for

778
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:50,310
what your campaign needs to be and

779
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,810
commonly that's that's what you see

780
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:55,720
puttin<font color="#CCCCCC"> IV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is used quite often</font>

781
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,310
very targeted campaign based attacks so

782
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always the most sophisticated</font>

783
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:03,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff as we know that attack only has to</font>

784
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,490
be sophisticated as it takes two<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

785
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,870
the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> done and many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times that is a</font>

786
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:11,350
reflection of the motive of the attacker

787
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:13,060
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're what the target is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

788
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,919
one was used against us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israeli</font>

789
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:19,470
government institutions and also Syrian

activist all right now for the the fun I

791
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:26,230
know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these terms are obnoxious and</font>

792
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,629
this cartoons even getting obnoxious at

793
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:31,000
this point but like i said i want to get

794
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,650
us riled up before we in the day so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

795
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,860
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about cyber</font>

796
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,300
warfare mainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we know a bit</font>

797
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,168
more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it than we did a couple years</font>

798
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,399
ago

799
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:42,220
there were actually some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the biggest</font>

800
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:43,689
names and experts in the industry we're

801
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,129
debating years ago that cyber warfare

802
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:51,129
simply did not exist which I I think

803
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:53,939
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> now had to recant it does</font>

804
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:57,009
exist it's existed for quite some time

805
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,230
certainly cyber espionage is existed for

806
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:01,570
a very long time if any of you Red

807
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:05,980
Cliffs<font color="#E5E5E5"> tolls Cuckoo's egg that's a great</font>

808
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:07,689
example of late 80s and we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

809
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,369
government's buying been buying zero-day

810
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,789
vulnerabilities now for probably close

811
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:14,350
to a decade at least that I know of so

812
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:17,259
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would they be doing with zero day</font>

813
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:20,199
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be defensive would be my</font>

814
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:22,389
question so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

815
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular topic when discussing cyber war</font>

816
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:27,488
but I know we don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> love</font>

817
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:30,039
this term in the industry so I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

818
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:31,809
it's upon us to change things however i

819
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,830
would say your ice skating uphill if you

820
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,350
think you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people to stop</font>

821
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:40,470
using the word cyber war bright PT or

822
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:44,199
cloud or big data so give it up but i

823
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:46,899
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say we could d toss the rest of</font>

824
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,149
the industry with some new terms you

825
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,649
know I was telling Jericho earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

826
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:52,418
blown away that as an industry we

827
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:54,699
actually got people to stop saying virus

828
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:57,279
all the time and now many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use</font>

829
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,619
malware I thought we'd be saying a virus

830
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,710
forever but malware is actually very

831
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:04,480
typical now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say it's you know</font>

832
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,279
if you want to change things stop

833
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading the Geneva Convention and</font>

834
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:10,629
carrying on about what war means start

835
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,990
reading somebody that matters like

836
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">George Carlin a guy that has many books</font>

837
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:18,069
on analyzing not only the English

838
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,260
language but how we use the English

839
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:23,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">language all right the problem is that</font>

840
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,940
cyber warfare is already coined apt is

841
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,429
already coins so we can hate the

842
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,589
terminology when it's on us to either

843
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,929
educate the person that is misusing it

844
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:34,599
or give another term to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

845
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care what you choose it</font>

846
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,460
could be cyber conflict you can correct

847
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> savored cyber espionage you</font>

848
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,569
pick but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's on us as an</font>

849
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:45,909
industry to get marketing to stop using

850
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:47,409
terms we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like and if you are</font>

851
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,669
buying from a vendor using a term you

852
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,440
don't like you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably tell them</font>

853
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font>

854
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,579
we changed a virus<font color="#E5E5E5"> into malware we can</font>

855
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:55,710
probably change other stuff or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

856
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,170
we can add<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it d</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh your marketing</font>

857
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:01,230
people or your<font color="#CCCCCC"> sales people maybe we've</font>

858
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:03,599
got a shot right but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

859
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,849
term should should have a shy away from

860
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,839
the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of something we do know</font>

861
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:11,640
that occurs attribution is difficult but

862
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,859
we know what happens right so to that

863
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,500
point there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some talks that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font>

864
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reference here Jericho and Josh</font>

865
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,819
Corman actually did a pretty good to

866
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,980
talks actually on this subject where

867
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:25,230
they went through the history<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

868
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,839
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> painful for them because that took</font>

869
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,430
a lot of work and research Marcus

870
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">raynham has been doing some talks about</font>

871
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,549
this I just did want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all cert and day</font>

872
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:37,440
by tell just did a talk where he brought

873
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,050
up these wikileaks articles at sis can

874
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,510
and so I want to cite these and point

875
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,310
out I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some important pieces funny</font>

876
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,390
enough the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WikiLeaks incident is</font>

877
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,819
actually how we learned quite a bit

878
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,529
about cyber warfare we knew the

879
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:51,960
government was buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days but then</font>

880
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,730
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> found out how much what that</font>

881
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,960
relationship looked like who the vendors

882
00:35:53,730 --> 00:36:00,630
were we got all this information on how

883
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,089
the US and Russia talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort</font>

884
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:06,030
of thing rush is interesting because

885
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:07,440
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact opposite of America</font>

886
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,380
right when there's a problem to an

887
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,560
American we just go solve it right we're

888
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,880
very responsive people security industry

889
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,410
is a great way to look at that right

890
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,089
something happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright then we</font>

891
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,240
respond and do something about it and

892
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,920
then we you know we fail we succeed and

893
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,890
then later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know it's why a lot of</font>

00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">our careers we write a book rush on the</font>

895
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,960
other hand very theoretical people right

896
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,250
so after the fall of communism they have

897
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,329
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of free time on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their hand they</font>

898
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,099
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight let's start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

899
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:38,069
cyber thing they've been thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

900
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:42,030
this a long time they know espionage

901
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:43,980
incredibly well at all levels and so you

902
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:47,910
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of that in WikiLeaks and</font>

903
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,800
how Russia's approach this anyway what

904
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:53,399
it says here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there is an arms race</font>

905
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. see it Russia sees it and it is</font>

906
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">cyber security is a political military</font>

907
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,830
issue that is the way these government's

908
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,640
view it I

909
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,759
I would say that's the way most

910
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">governments view it now the problem of</font>

911
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">course with cyber warfare is attribution</font>

912
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,590
it's a problem with any attack right

913
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,930
attribution is incredibly difficult and

914
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:17,020
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlighted in this wiki leaks</font>

915
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:19,779
here where they sake constraining state

916
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,430
capabilities were meaningless when

917
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,770
governments have no particular monopoly

918
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,319
on attack tools and attack attacks could

919
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:29,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">be carried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out by proxies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

920
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,580
what makes cyber horse or difficult one

921
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,680
it can be mixed with other type of

922
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,380
activity activism being a great example

923
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">and two it's all contracted the</font>

924
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,770
government doesn't directly do anything

925
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a powerpoint and</font>

926
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,090
build budget and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go hire</font>

927
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,330
someone else to do it right you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky</font>

928
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:48,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Martin's your raytheon's boeing's etc</font>

929
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:51,220
etc every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single country in the world</font>

930
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:56,350
does it just like the US all that kind

931
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:57,549
of activity is outsourced you know what

932
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,580
that actually leads into the next

933
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:05,050
example here going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was one</font>

934
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:08,759
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first cyber warfare debated</font>

935
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:11,590
incidents was Estonia so Estonia had a

936
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,440
statue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a Russian soldier from World</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">War two the victory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the Germans and</font>

938
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Estonia wanted to move it along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some burial plots that were close to it</font>

940
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously that upset Russia and then</font>

941
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,140
next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's tons of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos</font>

942
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,460
and web defacement activity obviously

943
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,890
the press jumped on that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

944
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a warfare arbor actually did a</font>

945
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,740
really good job of tracking this and we

946
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,939
looked at where the attacks came from

947
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,470
and of course that<font color="#CCCCCC"> came from a botnet</font>

948
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,290
all over the world tons of it came from

949
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:42,669
the US so can you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for certain type</font>

950
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:46,000
of warfare no however Putin has you know

951
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,230
Eugene Kaspersky on speed dial why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

952
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,080
such a stretch for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to think that he's</font>

953
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:52,690
got other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people on speed dial so you</font>

954
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,390
know it it is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a topic where</font>

955
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:58,930
sometimes you have to you know you have

956
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:01,420
to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> leap of faith and say is that</font>

957
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,859
possible yes we also know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course that</font>

958
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,260
it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was not</font>

959
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,760
related to any government at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it</font>

960
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,170
could also be that you've got you know I

961
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,310
mean how many sketchy people do you have

962
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,500
in a government<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't necessarily</font>

963
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to come from the top right that</font>

964
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,700
sort of thing happens over a year later

965
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:19,570
we saw same thing between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia and</font>

966
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Georgia d das was a very very big deal</font>

967
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:26,760
in the late 2000s in Eastern Europe in

968
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:28,960
general so some of the pioneers now

generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a matter of fact if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you</font>

you some<font color="#E5E5E5"> background on on this I</font>

972
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,029
actually went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a rant on</font>

973
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter one day and Jericho and my</font>

friends Tom cross and Rob Graham

975
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,410
disagreed so vehemently with me they all

976
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,990
went off and wrote blogs their blogs

977
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:53,410
even disagreed with each other which

978
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:55,720
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes to show how little anyone</font>

979
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,640
agrees on this topic but as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

980
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,770
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

981
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,720
should allow us to shy away from

982
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,570
discussing it you just have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss</font>

983
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a sane manner and not say cyber too</font>

984
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,940
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times but you'll notice China</font>

985
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,509
always comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has nothing to do</font>

with China<font color="#E5E5E5"> right reasons why Russia and</font>

China are not your problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright this</font>

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,130
of various countries those countries

991
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:28,200
make money off of us right so Obama

992
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,300
scrapped the jackson-vanik amendment

993
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,180
meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Russia was no longer a bad</font>

994
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,760
company no country bad with human rights

995
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,609
that sort of thing and so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

996
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:43,180
part of the World Trade Organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

997
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:46,420
firms can trade freely now there's legal

998
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,589
support there's intellectual property

999
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,570
support right all the things that

1000
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,520
America needs have a very successful

1001
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,130
relationship as we have with many

1002
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,470
countries is now there with Russia I

1003
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,150
think Russia is like 144 million people

1004
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,649
right that's a that's a pretty good

1005
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:04,420
market for the states to start selling

1006
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:06,460
into China you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see china owns a big</font>

1007
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,490
chunk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our debt the largest of any</font>

1008
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,340
foreign holder and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> China sells</font>

1009
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:15,490
a ton to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US all right so when you</font>

1010
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,300
hear comparisons to you know to a cold

1011
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,640
war

1012
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,650
the only part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really makes it that</font>

1013
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,009
that analogy work is the fact that there

1014
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:26,450
are lines where people are willing to

1015
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk up to them and not cross them</font>

1016
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,200
that's that's the good part I'll talk

1017
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:33,770
more about that here in a moment now who

1018
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,740
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we be worrying about well Iran</font>

1019
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,000
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good one now if you're</font>

1020
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,919
familiar with the bank attacks that have

1021
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,060
been occurring since late-september this

1022
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,560
is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most public campaign in</font>

1023
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,450
history you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we certainly know</font>

1024
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,430
campaigns go for very long periods of

1025
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,500
time but this one's been public from day

1026
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:54,230
one and has seen quite a bit of success

1027
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,840
along the way many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the top banks in</font>

1028
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,150
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. their websites fallen down this</font>

1029
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,270
has stressed and potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> even tested</font>

1030
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,400
the ISPs of the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1031
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the concern of the US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

1032
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,600
and of course the US government has<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

1033
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,340
out and said we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is Iran you</font>

1034
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,770
have not seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything from any vendor</font>

1035
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">arbor or otherwise they can lend any</font>

1036
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,930
credibility to that I have no idea all I

1037
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,580
can say is that if this was hacktivism

1038
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,520
it would definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> funded</font>

1039
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,990
hacktivism that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not difficult</font>

1040
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,870
lots of rich people in the world with

1041
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,939
with ideas of how things should be so

1042
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here is that for something to</font>

1043
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,020
go on for six seven months it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1044
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:37,280
got to be funded<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some level who it is</font>

1045
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:39,890
I don't know so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Iran</font>

1046
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,810
obviously if it was and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that</font>

1047
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">leap they don't have as much to lose</font>

1048
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,220
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> their relationship with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US not</font>

1049
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:49,850
the best another great<font color="#E5E5E5"> example that</font>

1050
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">North and South Korea not to say again</font>

1051
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,569
this was definitely right cyber warfare

1052
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,340
initially they said it was China and

1053
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:57,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said no it wasn't China again</font>

1054
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,120
attribution is insanely difficult the

1055
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,950
one thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say is attribution is</font>

1056
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:05,600
very difficult for us as an industry

1057
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:06,859
right we work with IPS domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs you</font>

1058
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,420
know these countries have three-letter

1059
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,770
agencies that do this and they have

1060
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,420
people on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the streets and they have</font>

1061
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">other ways to do attribution that we</font>

1062
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,830
don't it's also their job to do

1063
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:18,020
attribution there's no profit or

1064
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:21,440
motivation for most of us to chase

1065
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:23,780
attribution alright so again extremely

1066
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,190
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> however there was a North</font>

1067
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,450
Korean defector that said there was

1068
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,620
three thousand cyberwar experts

1069
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:31,500
North Korea and they were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1070
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:33,509
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world you know they're they're</font>

1071
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,710
testing nuclear bombs again probably not

1072
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">a stretch to think that they're building</font>

1073
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:39,300
some type of cyber capability what made

1074
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these other examples cyber</font>

1075
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,260
warfare the fact that these were

1076
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,510
offensive right so you have to make a

1077
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,370
step past cyber espionage and you have

1078
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:49,440
to destroy you something not necessarily

1079
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:53,040
physical hence<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word cyber being</font>

1080
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,600
first right so in this case they you

1081
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,330
know we're looking at data for seven

1082
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,279
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then destroyed it another</font>

1083
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">example not necessarily against cyber</font>

1084
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,190
warfare but just kind of shows you the

1085
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,560
kind of activity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens in</font>

1086
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Southeast Asia the dispute over the</font>

1087
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Spratly Islands again a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1088
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,100
government websites d da star defaced

1089
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:14,069
and now to talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1090
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is actually the easiest country</font>

1091
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:19,100
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of cyber warfare</font>

1092
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,509
when I was a kid Weapon X with Wolverine

1093
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:24,110
and he was awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he was one guy</font>

1094
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:27,330
and he could he could take out anything

1095
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:29,520
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X is cyber so you</font>

1096
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:33,750
have Project X which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the Pentagon</font>

1097
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,090
wanting to make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US a serious cyber</font>

1098
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,250
for so the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks at things as sea air</font>

1099
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:41,370
land and cyber so they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build up</font>

1100
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,440
that fourth pillar and project X's is

1101
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,120
their way of doing that plan X which

1102
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,720
just came out in the press I think this

1103
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,490
week or last is is probably an extension

1104
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,009
of that essentially they want to make

1105
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:56,339
cyber warfare as easy as angry birds so

1106
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,870
went the title I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is</font>

1107
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good analogy for the difference</font>

1108
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,980
between Generation X and Gen Y

1109
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:07,080
Millennials we had Wolverine you guys

1110
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,870
have Angry Birds the point is you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1111
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,730
the spy museum up in DC you see tons of

1112
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,440
amazing cool cold war stuff little

1113
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,480
cameras all these things about taking

1114
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,130
pictures right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government</font>

1115
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,020
just contracts that up one of the

1116
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,720
zillion defense contractors and make a

1117
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,940
custom edge image for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your iphone and</font>

1118
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,649
all that stuff is right there so if

1119
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,270
they're making custom images for spying

1120
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,400
why would they not go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and load</font>

1121
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:31,860
their weapon eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dex Boyd's which we</font>

1122
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,050
know they're buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto your phone so</font>

1123
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,640
you can use them wherever you're at

1124
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,980
makes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense actually</font>

1125
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,270
the Angry Birds thing is ridiculous but

1126
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:44,970
the rest of it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense so closing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1127
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,250
here again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say the good part of</font>

1128
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,980
this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why cyber</font>

1129
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,840
warfare isn't this terrible thing where

1130
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,090
you hear all sorts of awful analogies

1131
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,580
about real war and real people dying is

1132
00:45:54,090 --> 00:46:00,090
that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has really been willing to</font>

1133
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:02,549
do what is possible right the worst

1134
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,310
we've seen was Stuxnet which did affect

1135
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,950
the physical world but you know I can

1136
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,890
guarantee you a few of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us have read read</font>

1137
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:12,180
the Geneva Convention the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

1138
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,279
all the other governments has certainly

1139
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,330
read it I'm sure they had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> army of</font>

1140
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">lawyers when they were developing</font>

1141
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stuxnet and and knew what they were</font>

1142
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,820
getting themselves into so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

1143
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,980
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're building up the</font>

1144
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,620
capability have they really used it to

1145
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,800
date probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to the point of what</font>

1146
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,480
they have is it possible again I think

1147
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,700
it's naive to think it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

1148
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if we leave it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to the politicians</font>

1149
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the press to discuss this topic I</font>

1150
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:40,620
think we're doing ourselves a disservice

1151
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,550
so i would i would ask all of you to of

1152
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">course if you're going to use the</font>

1153
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,740
terminology attempt to use it properly

1154
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and educate and discuss it how many of</font>

1155
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,939
you follow politics show hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1156
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,430
well you're halfway to following cyber

1157
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,300
warfare just takes a lot more reading

1158
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,580
again start with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1159
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,890
presentations there's actually some

1160
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,860
material out there about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and again</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask be anoj into the majority of it</font>

1162
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,820
but there are offensive aspects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,669
past that and starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some of</font>

1185
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:28,330
days where you had ipv4 and things were

1186
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:31,120
much easier it I pv6 has already changed

1187
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:32,950
things you know the u.s. still has a

1188
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,009
pretty good ipv4 space but most

definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia don't there are</font>

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it matted internally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1193
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,760
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting incredibly difficult and</font>

1194
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:51,430
that's why i said chasing attributions

1195
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,930
really tough and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1196
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,640
that's why the government's honestly

1197
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,649
better left to do it mainly because they

1198
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,910
have other<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources but it's going to</font>

1199
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,520
become more of more of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge</font>

1200
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:02,109
certainly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the other thing some</font>

1201
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:05,140

activity but yeah I I see ipv6 only

1211
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,560
making it more difficult I see you know
