from a guy named Chris Nickerson these

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:06,610
are my credentials and essentially I've

15
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,400
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the infosec industry for 21</font>

24
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:42,039
was introduced to a guy named dr. Peter

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,169
a couple of years or a year or so and we

45
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,320
point that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much where we are</font>

46
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,179
the typical disclaimer I'm not

this presentation this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font>

setting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expectations I do as part of</font>

do while i do on occasion break into

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,280
systems this is not what this talk is

57
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:35,500
about this isn't about any new cool

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,230
tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a lot about the</font>

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,790
second half of this presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

60
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be talking a lot about natural</font>

61
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:49,299
systems so stay with me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

62
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:54,310
kind of cool we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know and</font>

63
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:57,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line is i like feedback the</font>

64
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,310
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself is probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

65
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:04,390
run a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little shorter than the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Express</font>

66
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:07,600
amount of time here but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> primary</font>

67
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,000
reason for that is I like a lot of

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,829
interaction and feedback and this topic

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:21,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's evolved from a talk that I</font>

70
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:24,280
gave last year at Derby con and it does

71
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the it does have the capability of</font>

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,239
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some really really</font>

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,099
interesting conversations in terms of

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,270
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of adapting how</font>

75
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:37,500
businesses are adapting to this you know

76
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,500
ever-changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment of</font>

77
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,299
vulnerability threat and risk to

78
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:48,139
organization

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:52,830
so the first half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk is about</font>

80
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:56,310
conflict and does anybody who hasn't

81
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,680
seen this presentation before the first

82
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,020
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the first few slides are</font>

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,600
directly from you know a previous talk

84
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:12,599
but does anybody here know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

85
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:18,900
date represents sorry nope close yeah so

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:23,729

91
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:41,930
represents the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last clean conflict that</font>

92
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:48,270
our country has has gotten involved in

93
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:53,270
the following years<font color="#E5E5E5"> are what we'll call</font>

94
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:58,710
unclean conflicts and as you can see

95
00:05:53,270 --> 00:06:01,609
we're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at them the we have a</font>

96
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,500
long and unprecedented history of

97
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:11,720
engaging in what we're going to call

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:13,740
unclean conflicts so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that's</font>

99
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,720
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

100

107
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,580
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day the Soviet Union fell okay</font>

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was coming for some time and there</font>

110

were you know from a global events

111
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:06,580
perspective that it does represent quite

112
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:11,820
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but in terms of what I'm</font>

113
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:16,599
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about today the</font>

114
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:19,690
ramifications of that event have some

115
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,330
really really interesting now we're

116
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,620
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know hindsight but</font>

117
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:29,609
have some really really interesting

118
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:33,310
impact in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our business culture</font>

119
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,920
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the fall of the Soviet</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Union what country in their right mind</font>

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,370
would realistically engage in any type

122
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:45,340
of formal conflict with at this time the

123

only superpower left in you know on the

125
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:59,130
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do such a thing when through</font>

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:08,409
nature you can accomplish your goals or

129
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:13,200
even surpass your goals at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point in</font>

131
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:22,469
adversaries have become much better at

132
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:25,210
executing unclean conflicts against us

133
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,160
which completely boggles you know

134
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,219
baffles me it's important when I think

135
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,000
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because we're so historically</font>

136
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:39,900
we've been so good at doing that type of

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,270
activity so how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we suddenly</font>

138
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:46,720
basically find ourselves with our pants

around their angles in terms of the data

140

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:58,180
of you know both corporate as well as

142
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:01,060
nation-state espionage and you know I'm

143
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,699
I promise I'll keep count of some of the

144
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,400
drinking a

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:16,860
point where probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more more thanks to</font>

148
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:19,860
the media than anything else that that

149
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,560
over the last I'll say three to five

150
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,320
years now we're really really coming to

151
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,739
grips with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the term you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know with this</font>

152
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:33,810
fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow we completely missed the</font>

153
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,730
boat on cyber unclean conflicts

154
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:40,589
everybody else is just kicking our butt

155
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,630
from that perspective so that's all well

156
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:48,000
and good but how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that relate to</font>

157
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:52,170
business and this is where this first

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,990
part of this talk I'm going to kind of

159
00:09:52,170 --> 00:10:00,420
make try to make this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is fury</font>

160
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:05,480
a right this mindset of who would

161
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:08,280
realistically confront us as a nation

162
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,630
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of filter down into our</font>

163
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:16,490
business DNA and that real you know as

164
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">far as as far as I'm concerned a</font>

165
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:27,450
business arrogance developed out of that

166
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:30,900
that basically our business leaders now

167
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,990
have you know post-cold war I'm sorry

168
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,560
yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> poster the follow Soviet Union</font>

169
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:41,970
have developed this complete arrogance

170
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:46,050
within the business culture of well who

171
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,210
in the right mind would realistically go

172
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,170
against what we're doing as well as

173
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,030
dictating to the rest of the world how

174
00:10:52,170 --> 00:11:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that from a business perspective</font>

175
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:07,020
right and who who really believes that

176
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest of the planet is you know is</font>

177
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:14,640
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh hello big</font>

178
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,170
business from the United States we're

179
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,769
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do whatever</font>

180
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:23,130
you want to do and how you want us to do

181
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:26,250
it and it doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that there's</font>

182
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:30,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">no incentive and just given the nature</font>

183
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,800
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and and and combining</font>

184
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:35,670
that with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of unclean</font>

185
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,930
conflict it's the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world is</font>

186
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:44,910
essentially no no we don't want to do

187
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:47,790
any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Josh Gorman had a great had</font>

188
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,069
a great little blurb here that I'm

189
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,620
stealing well I spend billions of

190
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars developing technology when you</font>

191
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,570
can purchase that stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology or</font>

192
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:03,060
steal it for a million dollars and

193
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:04,980
that's a really really valid point he's

194
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,949
a really smart guy too if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd if you</font>

195
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:12,120
don't know who he is I'm go find his

196
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:14,519
blog it's a cognitive distance so yeah

197
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,980
why would the rest of our competition

198
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,860
and our adversaries really care about

199
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:25,589
how we think they should run their

200
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:28,740
business and now with basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

201
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:33,540
expertise in digital unclean conflicts

202
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:37,769
making it so easy to even the playing

203
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,540
field what's the incentive for what luck

204
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:43,589
behavior what's the incentive for them

205
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:47,240
to behave there is no this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

206
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:50,339
favorite terms organizational entropy

207
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:54,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> result of assuming that you</font>

208
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:57,720
are smarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> than your adversaries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

209
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:02,339
it illustrates in two words very

210
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:08,810
elegantly in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the state of</font>

211
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:14,040
our business culture and and and now why

212
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:18,479
we are essentially trying to fix our own

213
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,849
arrogance in the face<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot of this a</font>

214
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,579
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the theft of intellectual</font>

215
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:28,410
property etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just purely from a</font>

216
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,880
business perspective I'm focusing on

217
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,140
let's say

218
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,430
intellectual property intellectual

219
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:38,220
capital as opposed to you know maybe

220
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:41,310
more the criminal side of the house<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

221
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,350
a from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> profit perspective just because</font>

222
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:47,609
from my perspective it's more

223
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,980
interesting right so now now our pants

224
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">are around our ankles what's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

225
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,840
reaction right well I apologize to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

226
00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:00,829
sponsors but you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the biggest</font>

227
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:05,580
reactions as to buy more blinky things

228
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:08,310
right different technologies etc we're

229
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking now with organizations who are</font>

230
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:17,040
promoting hack back<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so instead of</font>

231
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,560
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting back and doing damage</font>

232
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,150
control and following your<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident</font>

233
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,030
response procedures and business

234
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:27,709
continuity etc you've got people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

235
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:31,439
now promoting go after your attackers

236
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:35,460
that's an interesting argument I'm I'm

237
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:42,650
not really sure I support it but it is

238
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:42,650
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is and and legislation right so</font>

239
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:51,690
in order to mitigate things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

240
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,520
completely ignored over<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

241
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,700
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say for argument's sake the</font>

242
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,250
round numbers 20 years right in order to

243
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,330
mitigate that now we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

244
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:09,050
SOPA and sista and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things of that nature</font>

245
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:13,280
that are mitigating attempts right and

246
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:16,280
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line is from my in my opinion</font>

247
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,959
if you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where a problem</font>

248
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,150
becomes so big that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

249
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,930
legislate it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to fix it and</font>

250
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:28,890
protect let's say national<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well as</font>

251
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:31,199
global economic<font color="#CCCCCC"> states you've completely</font>

252
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:40,319
missed the point you've completely

253
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:42,900
missed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a boat right oh that policy</font>

254
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,560
should not dictate society society needs

255
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,600
to dictate

256
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,569
policy and legislating your problems

257
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:54,330
away never works but the overarching

258
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,790
irony from this you know from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

259
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:00,180
this now is that big<font color="#E5E5E5"> business this whole</font>

260
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:05,459
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big business arrogance has</font>

261
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:10,349
fueled a larger big business of product

262
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:14,720
solutions and I just kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked that</font>

263
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">irony we've got you know a gigantic</font>

264
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:22,500
industry for you know the vulnerability

265
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,930
databases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the firewalls and all of that</font>

266
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:31,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">is is maybe not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is directly</font>

267
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:34,680
related but a lot of that is is related

268
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:38,279
to this whole big business arrogance

269
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:43,800
from you know from everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

270
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:45,210
pretty much laid out<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so my</font>

271
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,729
assumption here is that the majority of

272
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people at this event are at least in</font>

273
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:56,040
infosec in some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form what's</font>

274
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:58,080
our role right preventing the loss of

275
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,010
both replaceable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and irreplaceable data</font>

276
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:07,260
again Josh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korman is a really smart guy</font>

277
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:09,209
he and David it to somebody correct me

278
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,770
on this Jericho do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> David</font>

279
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:15,860
Lassner how do you pronounce David a

280
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:20,579
tues last name david @ e<font color="#E5E5E5"> to e tu e now</font>

281
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:24,569
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Korman did a at to thank</font>

282
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:26,790
you he and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korman did a talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

283
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,649
talk about replaceable<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

284
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:31,770
irreplaceable data I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

285
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,530
tangent on this one so you've got

286
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,540
replaceable data such like things as

287
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,360
credit-card number social-security

288
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:42,899
numbers and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> irreplaceable</font>

289
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:48,270
data like intellectual property so if

290
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:53,730
you're replaceable data gets stolen it's

291
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:56,190

292
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,940
intellectual property gets stolen that's

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,800
not

I ssible promoting innovation which

295
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:10,800
really means for for for all intents and

purposes promoting risk within an

innovation to really be successful and

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:25,050
then protecting the brand right so that

301
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,690
kind of an you know from from my

302
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:34,639
perspective that's really what info SEC

303
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:38,490
is all about that then really drives

304
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,360
these types of I think these right here

305
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,580
a show<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hands does anybody know or has</font>

310
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:07,470
that debt boggles my mind right as an

311
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:10,429
infosec professional I need to know what

312

my business<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wants to do that</font>

318
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,080
the initiatives are important too for us

319
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,480
to be successful we we need to know what

320
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,850
then that business critical data is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

321
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,130
so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right one more show of hands who</font>

322
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:42,990
knows what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business critical data</font>

323
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:49,230
is a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people okay do you know</font>

324
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:52,350
where it lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people you sure</font>

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean you know bait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lik said</font>

it best<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard bait look from mania</font>

327
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:01,140
identity is your is the new corporate

328
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:03,030
perimeter right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

329
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,130
problem the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with walls in a</font>

330
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:08,610
minute firewalls and things of that

331
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,620
nature and then and and then who might

332
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,100
find value in that data

333
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:17,669
so just these are the things in my

334
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:21,300
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are the top the most</font>

335
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:24,000
important things for infosec people to

336
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,389
know and understand in order to

337
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,940
successfully protect the business itself

338
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:35,610
right so this this message is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

339
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,500
is a little generic right and and the

340
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:43,800
message that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convey is really</font>

341
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:46,200
that our infosec problems are excuse me

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:52,879
naturally related to a larger set of

343
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:55,679
problems so if if our actual focused

344
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:01,200
infosec issues are inherently related to

345
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:03,270
larger information problems and common

346
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,050
and natural issues that effectively

347
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,580
makes if we deal with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

348
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,809
individual let's say you know somebody's

349
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,760
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

350
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:13,740
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my firewall or you know</font>

351
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,900
what vulnerability is going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

352
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,240
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it if we kind of associate that</font>

353
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:23,520
with an adaptation perspective we have

354
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,870
basically reduced the problem space we

355
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,740
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about things a little</font>

356
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:36,149
differently the unnatural state of

357
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,250
things is we you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned this</font>

358
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,770
earlier but we've defined an environment

359
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,740
where greed and policy is dictating

360
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:47,360
business and society and you know

361
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:50,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">regardless of any regardless of</font>

362
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,530
political motivation or opinion or

363
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,678
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that that's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

364
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:57,450
backwards you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said society</font>

365
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to dictate policy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not policy</font>

366
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:03,420
dictating society and the longer that we

367
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:09,960
are accepting kind of this unnatural

368
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:12,570
state the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the longer and and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

369
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,460
that this window here right this window

370
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">exists for our adversaries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch up</font>

371
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,940
and and eventually if they haven't

372
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,070
already if some<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't already</font>

373
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,720
depending on the business depending on

374
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,040
if we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer to nation state</font>

375
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,260
etc

376
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,550
to catch up and surpass us it's

377
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:37,650
unnatural and and the drivers are you

378
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:39,120
know power greed etc so this guy Joel

379
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,920
Brenner wrote this book America<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

380
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,840
vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anybody familiar with with</font>

381
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:53,120
this book at all it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind</font>

382
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:57,270
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's more used these days for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fud</font>

383
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,179
by a lot of security vendors but this

384
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,400
one quote was really really kind of

385
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,670
poignant and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to include</font>

386
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,890
this right organizations must must learn

387
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:11,160
and and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize learn</font>

388
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,510
here because the second half of this the

389
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,960
second half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk is going to be</font>

390
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:18,660
focused on adaptation and learning and

391
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,600
cooperation are key elements to

392
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,430
adaptation so organizations must learn

393
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,580
to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a world where less and less</font>

394
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:29,100
information can be kept secret and where

395
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,189
a secret information will remain secret

396
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,169
for less and less time so regardless of

397
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,660
your opinion about the book and and how

398
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,270
it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of intended to</font>

399
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,190
scare the bejesus out of everybody

400
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:48,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a really interesting and and and</font>

401
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:58,470
and very useful kind of tool to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in</font>

402
00:23:48,570 --> 00:24:01,409
mind here so adaptation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the DB irr</font>

403
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:05,690
is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't see anything in the</font>

404
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:08,940
2013 debe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir about undetected</font>

405
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,320
percentages but the 2012 debe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ir stated</font>

406
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:16,440
that ninety two percent of the breaches

407
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:18,929
went undetected that's to me that was

408
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,790
interesting so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety two percent of</font>

409
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,850
the brie and again percentages whatever

410
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:27,510
if a large percentage of breaches went

411
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:32,429
undetected is detection or is better

412
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:34,140
detection necessarily the answer we can

413
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know all of the</font>

414
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,450
Associated controls that we have today

415
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,899
a you know from your firewalls your

416
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:47,360
antivirus etc but adding or improving

417
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,880
existing systems is not adapting so

418
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,770
where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of leave us</font>

419
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright the definition of adaptation is</font>

420
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:58,889
you know and according to this guy that

421
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up in a second it</font>

422
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:06,900
arises from leaving or being forced out

423
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:10,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of your comfort zone so your comfort</font>

424
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:15,000
zone what's how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that relate what's</font>

425
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:18,439
a comfort<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a business is that</font>

426
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,120
can anybody think of you know a decent

427
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:25,380
idea of what a comfort zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

428
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,300
businesses right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if if as an</font>

429
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,400
organization you're not leaving your

430
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:40,230
comfort zone then there's no incentive

431
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:43,320
to adapt so this book<font color="#E5E5E5"> some punk named</font>

432
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nickerson mentioned it on one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

433
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,000
podcasts and it sounded it's called

434
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning from the octopus you can't</font>

435
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,130
really see that yeah that's a horrible

436
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:58,950
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically learning from the</font>

437
00:25:53,130 --> 00:26:00,570
octopus how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> help fight how can</font>

438
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,990
nature help us fight terrorism and

439
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:08,060
things of that nature it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> written by</font>

440
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:11,550
this biologist called Rafe's<font color="#E5E5E5"> agarron and</font>

441
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:15,690
it was you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of struck a</font>

442
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:18,300
chord with me I went to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up I'm a</font>

443
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,430
real big<font color="#CCCCCC"> fan of things like emergence by</font>

444
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">steven johnson and the wisdom of crowds</font>

445
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:25,880
by James Surowiecki is anybody familiar

446
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:34,890
with the wisdom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crowds by the way</font>

447
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:36,900
couple so here here's my here's my kind

448
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like advice if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody is in infosec</font>

449
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,730
pick this book up it's really really

450
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,590
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the next part you know that</font>

451
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:47,430
this latter half of this talk is going

452
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be me kind of hopefully connecting</font>

453
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,279
some dots in terms of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this relates</font>

454
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,899
to

455
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,879
how this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of adaptation scheme</font>

456
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:55,879
relates to business business adaptation

457
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">was I want to talk a second about wisdom</font>

458
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:05,309
of crowds because I really really dug it

459
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:09,299
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> blends really well with some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

460
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:11,729
the adaptation requirements that I'm

461
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:14,129
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up in a second wisdom of</font>

462
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:15,869
crowds essentially states that when you

463
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:18,840
have a big sample set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

464
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:21,779
interesting people whether they're and

465
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,369
ranges of people right from lower

466
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,799
intelligence to higher intelligence just

467
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:28,519
a nice good sample set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that if</font>

468
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:33,179
you present them with a problem

469
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:35,729
collectively the group will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

470
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:39,509
accuracy and and in terms of solving

471
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:42,029
that problem and the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I want</font>

472
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:44,429
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give is the USS scorpion which was</font>

473
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:48,210
the only I believe the only nuclear sub

474
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:51,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we ever lost the at the time this</font>

475
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:54,539
was like 68 i believe so at the time the

476
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:56,549
director of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> navy basically said he</font>

477
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,109
gave this challenge to everybody within

478
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,839
the organization and anybody could

479
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:07,019
participate from generals to custodians

480
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:09,869
so give me your individual best guess as

481
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:12,599
to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the sub and where do</font>

482
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:15,599
you think it went down based on its last

483
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:19,619
radio communications now this is in the

484
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:22,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of the Atlantic Ocean so that</font>

485
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:23,879
challenge went out and got back all

486
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,468
these results<font color="#CCCCCC"> and nobody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was even close</font>

487
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:28,619
in terms of when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually found the</font>

488
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:31,469
sub however the collective answer when

489
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:34,468
they kind of like merged all everybody

490
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:39,629
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answers together ended up being</font>

491
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:43,019
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it was 225 yards away from</font>

492
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:45,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual location of the of the down</font>

493
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:50,029
sub on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean

494
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:55,049
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind-blowing I think but anyway</font>

495
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:58,739
so yeah wisdom of crowds adaptability so

496
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:01,668
that he talks the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sioux garen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman</font>

497
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:04,140
talks about the benefits of

498
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:08,760
decentralized and distributed systems

499
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:11,070
right so multiple sensors no

500
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:16,440
preconceived notions and specialized

501
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:19,740
tasks tasks are all kind of the required

502
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,640
variables to have these types of

503
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,740
adaptable systems and I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

504
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,700
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple centers in a second</font>

505
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,640
because it that ties in with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

506
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,700
our security awareness issues in terms

507
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,130
of corporate security awareness programs

508
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,900
and and when I say of security awareness

509
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,700
programs i'm not talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

510
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,220
little socks<font color="#E5E5E5"> check mark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm talking</font>

511
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:50,460
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> true blue security awareness</font>

512
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:52,140
programs because my buddy of mine from

513
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cleveland Dave Kennedy some of you may</font>

514
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">know he made a really really great point</font>

515
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">about security awareness which is I</font>

516
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:08,000
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> much rather have an entire system</font>

517
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:12,330
of intrusion detection sensors right

518
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,590
meaning all of you in the in the company

519
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:19,620
right that that go that that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

520
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:25,429
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> further than than our traditional</font>

521
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:28,739
controls in terms of alerting upon a

522
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:38,760
weird behavior right potential malicious

523
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:40,530
behavior to have success in an adaptive

524
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,600
state and adaptive environment these

525
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,520
things really have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the these are</font>

526
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,899
basically your requirements you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

527
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,210
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and this relates to</font>

528
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,250
getting out of your comfort zone again

529
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,900
you need to have resources and and you

530
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,550
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to prioritize the</font>

531
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:01,980
information that you are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

532
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:06,960
right from your sensors etc symbiosis is

533
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:10,470
a very important adaptive trait and

534
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you have three types of</font>

535
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,030
symbiosis mutualistic which means you

536
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,770
know both parties are<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefiting</font>

537
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,350
commensalism one part

538
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,510
benefits the others not affected and

539
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:30,679
parasitic which one party benefits the

540
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:33,290
other suffers now these reactions it

541
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:37,170
develops into essentially an

542
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:41,159
organizational structure and emergent

543
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:42,990
properties not only transform the

544
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,750
environment but transform the organism

545
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:49,590
and and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a little</font>

546
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:50,910
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little vague but I think you'll</font>

547
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,090
kind of see where I'm going with this

548
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:56,790
when I when I finish this or when I get

549
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:02,760
through those natural security

550
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:06,270
strategies here right a lot of this is

551
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,820
kind of you know of course learning is

552
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:14,160
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> T to net you know an adaptive</font>

553
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:16,710
survival redundancy is obvious but

554
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,580
basically you know when we talk about

555
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:27,000
needing to reduce uncertainty and create

556
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:29,610
uncertainty for adversaries that's that

557
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,420
that's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a strategy that today</font>

558
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:36,929
we're promoting and or we need to

559
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:38,580
further promote because making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

560
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,980
creating uncertainty for your

561
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:45,720
adversaries right so so honey pots is a

562
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:48,690
great example right how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we how can</font>

563
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:52,680
we now take<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ideas and apply them</font>

564
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:54,570
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business I mean realistically</font>

565
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,020
delaying an operation you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know an</font>

566
00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:00,149
increase in to potential for error right

567
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:06,590
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering that's perfect for</font>

568
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:09,960
that the problem with walls right the

569
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,520
like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that we most</font>

570
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,830
organizations are looking for

571
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:18,990
inexpensive effective controls to solve

572
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:22,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems right we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent</font>

573
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,620
BYOD or or we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage BYOD or</font>

574
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:28,230
apt or cyber whatever right I might as

575
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,139
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I might as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well just bring up</font>

576
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,240
art of war and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

577
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:36,440
paradigm shift to make sure I drink the

578
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,770
rest of the night but the great analogy

579
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,660
though here is from in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

580
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:44,960
are all static controls and<font color="#CCCCCC"> static</font>

581
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,210
controls are eventually going to fail

582
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">right you're going to be able to get</font>

583
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,250
beyond the firewall the levees in New

584
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Orleans are going to you know overflow</font>

585
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:59,270
or break in some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form there</font>

586
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,610
are all sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

587
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:06,410
bypass these things and and again you

588
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:08,299
know there's a great analogy one of the

589
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,980
really good analogies in the book is he

590
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,990
talks about this jumping spider right

591
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,740
there's this jumping spider that that

592
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:19,009
mimics the<font color="#E5E5E5"> olfactory whatever of this</font>

593
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:23,029
type of ant and therefore it can get

594
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:26,720
into the anthill and then it mimics the

595
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:28,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">stroke which communicates it's like</font>

596
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,639
stroking the ant that's carrying the

597
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:34,040
larvae and and that let's stroke is is

598
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication of hey you know I'll</font>

599
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,080
take that over for you and so the ant

600
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,850
drops the larvae and the spider picks it

601
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,560
up and boom now we've got a free meal

602
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:46,000
right what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> call that in the</font>

603
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:54,440
infosec industry social<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering</font>

604
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,750
right it's easy so again the problem

605
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,620
with walls right<font color="#E5E5E5"> for static we need to</font>

606
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:04,760
be more dynamic in terms of in terms of

607
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:06,410
protecting the business right but we're

608
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to just leave things alone and</font>

609
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:13,129
figure out and watch things naturally

610
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:19,390
decay or naturally break there has to be

611
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:24,130
something in the middle you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know again</font>

612
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:28,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">how can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be more natural and build</font>

613
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:30,560
dynamic dynamic actual living security

614
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,990
systems we're pretty smart as as a

615
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:38,060
species we need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to kind of</font>

616
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:39,859
figure all this stuff out right but even

617
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,310
though that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though we as a</font>

618
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,790
species are really good at adapting

619
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,620
individually

620
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,529
we have created<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems and institutions</font>

621
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:54,560
that are completely unadapted or non

622
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:56,450
adaptable<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember adaptation occurs</font>

623
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,850
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get out of your comfort zone</font>

624
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,230
and one of the primary reasons our

625
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,299
business infrastructure doesn't adapt

626
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,700
well to the changing environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

627
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,930
today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threats is the fact</font>

628
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:12,009
that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our business culture is</font>

629
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:14,569
comfortable where they're at right

630
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:17,050
generating revenue distributing profit

631
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,670
things of that nature there's no

632
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:25,720
incentive to get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that comfort</font>

633
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:29,630
zone and adapt begin to adapt to prevent

634
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,140
let's say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know access of business</font>

635
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:35,390
critical data so the challenge right how

636
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:39,710
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> design systems that can deal with</font>

637
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:47,990
security problems and respond more

638
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:49,760
organically and automatically right what

639
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:55,970
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in the next couple of</font>

640
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,680
slides it is you know in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:01,399
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> infant you know in addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

642
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,009
these this data here I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

643
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,510
feedback as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well from you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

644
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:10,550
people sitting in here in terms of what

645
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:12,650
what kind of interesting ideas does your

646
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:15,490
organ is it to your organization's do

647
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:20,110
that might stimulate some of this

648
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:24,140
decentralized and and and and you know

649
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:28,880
adaptation kind of information right but

650
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:33,580
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> usage here using information</font>

651
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,920
it basically organisms need to seek

652
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,720
reduced entry seek to reduce uncertainty

653
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,820
for themselves and increase uncertainty

654
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,379
for average for their adversaries so I

655
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,770
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of touched on it earlier in terms</font>

656
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,920
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know being able to you know</font>

657
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:52,580
create types of uncertainty and

658
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:56,060
unpredictability but using information

659
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,259
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survival situations right that's</font>

660
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,350
when we adapt

661
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,090
we're in survival situations and when

662
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,650
we're just kind of in our comfort zone

663
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:08,210
that that adaptation doesn't doesn't

664
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:11,480
happen unpredictability is really about

665
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:17,510
increasing the costs for our adversaries

666
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:20,990
right the the concept of adversary our

667
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,580
ally and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm stealing a lot from</font>

668
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:25,240
Josh Corman here this is one of his

669
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:28,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">things adversarial our ally right</font>

670
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,529
increasing or decreasing the return on

671
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,460
investment for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your adversaries as as</font>

672
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:37,010
they are trying to attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if we</font>

673
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,500
can design systems that basically

674
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:41,720
prevent those people looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to steal</font>

675
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,430
your at<font color="#CCCCCC"> your intellectual property or a</font>

676
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,359
business critical data if those systems

677
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:51,080
are designed such that it's just enough

678
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,990
to blow the return on investment because

679
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:57,200
you know let's not mince words here data

680
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:59,330
theft is big business<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's a</font>

681
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of resources that go into it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

682
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:06,319
every business needs to show on our lie

683
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,180
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can kind of lower that ROI for</font>

684
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,180
the adversaries that's an interesting

685
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:15,230
you know strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that organizations</font>

686
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:19,940
need to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider competition and</font>

687
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:22,220
cooperation so this is and again what I

688
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,470
like about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

689
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,750
these cons is that there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

690
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,279
cooperation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and information sharing that</font>

691
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,370
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lends itself to this</font>

692
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,730
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay competition between organisms</font>

693
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:37,990
leads to cooperation<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a can in many</font>

694
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,580
instances<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

695
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:42,319
individual organisms that are let's say

696
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,569
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for food and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know if</font>

697
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:49,160
they team up and cooperate they get

698
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:51,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">better at doing that right so once that</font>

699
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:56,089
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of group cooperation has been</font>

700
00:39:51,770 --> 00:40:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">established now that group has a much</font>

701
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:02,900
better much better chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> at being more</font>

702
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,830
successful than other groups however

703
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:08,600
when that happens you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

704
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign up now you know competition between</font>

705
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,480
groups then yields even

706
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:17,420
greater cooperation within groups and

707
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,470
that's part of the adaptive<font color="#CCCCCC"> life cycle</font>

708
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,650
okay that's that's how you know from

709
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:28,759
from an important feature perspective

710
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">cooperative networks emerging naturally</font>

711
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,650
right and not mandated they're designed

712
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:36,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve specific problems specific</font>

713
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:40,010
problems though we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talking about</font>

714
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:42,859
solving world peace<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so cooperating</font>

715
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:45,920
and being able and basically having a

716
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:49,549
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve with a large enough</font>

717
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,060
with a good sample set of organisms or

718
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:54,740
people or whatever we want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

719
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:59,750
you know that that's how cooperative

720
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:04,009
networks really really contribute to the

721
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:06,380
adaptation lifecycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm talks about</font>

00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:33,740
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> they occur as opposed to you know</font>

731
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:38,210
reactionary static type of controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

732
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:41,810
we have today the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics though from</font>

733
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:45,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">an adaptation perspective are kind of</font>

734
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's it's not rocket science right so</font>

735
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:53,960
think of think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization that</font>

736
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:55,580
you work in today right are you an

737
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,990
environment where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are presented with</font>

738
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:02,900
with problems to solve as opposed to

739
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:06,589
being given directives<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because when</font>

740
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,280
you're given a directive that assumes

741
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:11,720
that there's one solution as opposed to

742
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,680
having a group of really smart people

743
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,779
look at a problem and and figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

744
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,000
probably what is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up being</font>

745
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,640
the more elegant solution right<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

746
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,920
that whole wisdom of crowds kind of

747
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:29,629
of mentality mm-hmm monetary incentives

748
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:33,790
oddly enough are not odd monetary

749
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:37,750
incentives are are even better at

750
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:40,790
stimulating the group kind of think tank

751
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,150
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's called the Iowa</font>

752
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:46,670
electric electronic markets is a

753
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:50,480
nonprofit organization that they

754
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:51,680
basically say okay we monitor we're

755
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about and monitor</font>

756
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,310
elections okay so who do you think is

757
00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:01,100
going to win this particular election

758
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:03,080
now in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to strip out the in order</font>

759
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to strip out the politics there's a</font>

760
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,819
monetary incentive right if you're right

761
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:11,510
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dollar or you get ten dollars</font>

762
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,760
or something like that and the once once

763
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,290
your actual kind of you know wherever

764
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,340
you stand politically once that's out of

765
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the equation the results are</font>

766
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:25,010
staggeringly accurate in terms of

767
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,510
predicting who's going to win either you

768
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">know from a presidential elections all</font>

769
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,650
the way down to City Council and things

770
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:37,720
of that nature right so so monetary

771
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:41,870
incentives are actually really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good so</font>

772
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:44,149
from a business perspective and this is

773
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:49,880
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrapping all this up into one</font>

774
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:53,990
little ball here instead of security

775
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:57,530
strategies that are geared towards

776
00:43:53,990 --> 00:44:00,009
designing solutions we need to think

777
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make that adapting</font>

778
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:10,220
solutions right moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from giving</font>

779
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:12,980
orders providing challenges you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

780
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:17,799
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> outstanding solutions come from</font>

781
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:22,460
from from that adaptation group thing so

782
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,620
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I kind of you know see if</font>

783
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,300
there are any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments I'd</font>

784
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:31,040
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a little feedback from</font>

785
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:33,410
anybody in here are you involved in any

786
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,830
type of initiative within your

787
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:41,310
organization

788
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:47,430
that allows for this type of communal

789
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:50,220
almost sensory you know programs does

790
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:56,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody have anything like like that</font>

791
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,359
within their organization nobody

792
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:08,810
interesting I don't know you tell me I

793
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,810
mean does this this is make any sense

794
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:23,730
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting booted off sure I'll be</font>

795
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:27,320
