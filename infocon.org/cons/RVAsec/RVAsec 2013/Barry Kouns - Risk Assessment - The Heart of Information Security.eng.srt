1
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,760
good afternoon everybody thank you for

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
coming I want to apologize for having to

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,520
stand here because the the wireless mic

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,990
doesn't work normally I like to kind of

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,630
work the crowd out this way but forgive

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,239
me for hiding behind a podium I just

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,520
want to give you a little context from

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,410
our previous speaker he talked about

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,420
context instead of context with me is

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm a ISO 27001 kind of consultant guide

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,780
it works with small to medium sized

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,360
organizations and then I tried to figure

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,480
out a way to help them understand risk

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,960
assessment okay so from the context of

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,839
my presentation think of yourself as a

16
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,780
small medium-sized organization that has

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,480
basically no I t or security support and

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,850
we're trying to do a risk assessment in

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,100
order to identify what you need to do in

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,440
terms of security controls so that's the

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,950
context before I get going how about

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,140
helping me with your context how many of

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,720
you are risk assessment specialists okay

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,810
please as I'm going through this as we

25
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,990
talk argue with me only for a little bit

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,730
because I have a time constraint but

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,180
feel free to interact questions I don't

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,980
want to wait to the end with questions

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,560
so as we go to the slides I may say to

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,420
you I'm going to answer that in just a

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,360
second but you know talk to me this is

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,700
about trying to facilitate a

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,400
conversation rather than me lecturing to

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,530
you okay so if you can't agree with that

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,320
how many are real management people who

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,240
really don't know anything about risk

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,600
assessment ok I'll be talking to you a

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,010
lot and if you listen to the other guy

39
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,830
so it's going to be in that context ok

40
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,739
so here we're going to do first we're

41
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,569
going to have a little warm-up quiz you

42
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,480
know a few questions true or false

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,500
honestly if you have a piece of paper

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,269
write down what your answers are and

45
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,190
then when we give the answers let's see

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,650
how well you did if we had more time I'd

47
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,690
break you up into teams and see who wins

48
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,730
but we don't have time for that then I

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,920
want to talk about why do we do risk

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,680
assessments the language of risk

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,890
assessment just like to

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,360
previous speaker mentioned we had to

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,150
kick on the same wavelength and then I'm

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,470
going to walk you through the various

55
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,140
steps within the risk assessment process

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,390
might get a little Boreas in there but

57
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,700
I'll promise to kind of move it fast and

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,040
then I want to kind of summarize with

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,010
what i like to call a risk mitigation

60
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,750
triangle give me some liberties there

61
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,020
but I'll kind of summarize it a couple

62
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,760
management types say to me if you two

63
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,739
just told me that in the beginning I

64
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,330
would have known what you wanted me to

65
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,670
do during the last risk assessment okay

66
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,590
so it kind of summarize it and then a

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,570
couple lessons learned and then we'll be

68
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,970
done so again interact with me okay

69
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,630
ready for a quiz here we go question one

70
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,970
these are true or false conducting a

71
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,400
risk assessment is optional for most

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,019
organizations take a note how about this

73
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,180
one risk assessment is a decision

74
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,360
support aid not a decision-making tool

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,680
risk assessments should focus around

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,200
business processes where areas

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,540
responsibility rather than individual

78
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,660
assets that I'll see any be right and

79
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,180
the answers down risk assessment has

80
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,390
been used by some enterprises as

81
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,950
rationale not to implement security

82
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,290
controls about their plagued by

83
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,120
subjectivity which means they're pretty

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,959
much worthless and last the process can

85
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,730
improve communication between various

86
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,579
groups some of these seem

87
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,799
straightforward right others we may

88
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,010
argue about okay you only accept the

89
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,049
risk assessment is performed by the

90
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:15,040
expert risk assessments only need to be

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,238
done one time professionals are

92
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,590
ultimately responsible for residual risk

93
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,820
hmm I've had arguments of people about

94
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,430
that one if you don't have all the data

95
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,630
it's just a waste of time anyway a

96
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,039
proper risk assessment can help you

97
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,750
prioritize spending hmm and the last one

98
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,479
risk is the effect of uncertainty on

99
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,870
objectives

100
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,910
and can include both positive and

101
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,060
negative responses okay everybody have

102
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,190
your answers all right now let's do it

103
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,550
again okay it's optional how many think

104
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,760
that's true how many think it's false

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,150
false it's really not optional even if

106
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,430
you don't do a risk assessment by the

107
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,080
virtue of you not doing one you have

108
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,110
done one and you just don't you just not

109
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,710
aware the outcome make sense about this

110
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,340
one it's a decision support aid not a

111
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,590
decision-making tool I may think that's

112
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,630
true I may think that's false that's

113
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,680
true nice how about this one you should

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,620
focus on a business process or area

115
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,200
responsibility rather than zeroing in on

116
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,560
assets how many think that's true false

117
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,800
it's one or two that's true again just

118
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
like the previous speaker we talking

119
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,040
about where is the flow of your data

120
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,530
where is your most critical data reside

121
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,140
generally in a business process ordinary

122
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,540
responsibility don't just go jumping in

123
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,450
and and risks assessing servers without

124
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,110
knowing what's on them okay but this one

125
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,660
it has in fact been used by enterprises

126
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,600
for rationale not to implement security

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,660
controls how many think that's true yeah

128
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,270
that is true and again that's not

129
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,300
necessarily a negative thing because in

130
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,660
essence certain risk levels you're not

131
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,570
going to implement right how about this

132
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,910
one they're plagued by subjectivity

133
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,680
which means that you cannot be relied

134
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,430
upon how many people think that's true

135
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,310
very good that's false

136
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,620
it can improve communication between

137
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,470
different diverse organizations true

138
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,800
right definitely well done okay last

139
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,430
couple the only risk assessment the only

140
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,080
acceptable one is performed by the

141
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,710
experts how many think that's true very

142
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,340
good risk assessments only need to be

143
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,110
done one time anybody think that's true

144
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,170
that's not how about this security

145
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,270
professionals are ultimately responsible

146
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,500
for accepting residual risks how many of

147
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,680
you think it's a security guys problem

148
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,610
to accept risk anybody that's good

149
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,160
because it's not just like the previous

150
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,290
speaker said it is amazing though how

151
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,240
many how many security guides I've

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,970
talked to over time to think they own

153
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,830
the risk in there too once making a city

154
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,380
I say you're operating way above your

155
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,420
pay grade buddy because it's not you're

156
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:35,480
not your decision okay I'm sorry that's

157
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,850
right that's right and there are very

158
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,860
many business owners product owners who

159
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,420
are more than willing to allow you to

160
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,130
make the RIS decision come to you and

161
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,310
say can I do this not our role to say

162
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,410
whether you can or can't is to advise

163
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,580
you of the various risks right if you

164
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,070
don't have all the data it's a waste of

165
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,580
time how many think that's true of

166
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,140
course that's false you never have all

167
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,560
the data write a proper risk assessment

168
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,590
can help you prioritize security

169
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,600
spending right right I mean that's kind

170
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,670
of like we named our company risk-based

171
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,600
security did you have a question okay

172
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,100
feel free anytime and the last one risk

173
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,570
is the effect of uncertainty on

174
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,450
objectives and can include positive and

175
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,260
negative that's no it's a hard concept

176
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,539
to wrap our minds around it is for me

177
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,010
because we always think risk meaning

178
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,159
negative but it's also positive and that

179
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,350
neck that's really brought to light and

180
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,000
then

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,070
so standard 31,000 that the previous

182
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,110
speaker met you okay so how's you guys

183
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,760
do experts okay you will be at the end

184
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,460
did you find it did you like it there

185
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,010
are plenty okay so why do we perform

186
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,370
risk assessments well first of all there

187
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,720
are plenty of assets that need

188
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,770
protecting right now again many of us

189
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,390
focus on the information assets but

190
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,190
their assets everywhere right physical

191
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,610
assets the information itself software

192
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,440
the services supporting documentation

193
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,570
people brand cultures I mean we have to

194
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,330
look at the totality of the assets the

195
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,310
organization is attempting to protect

196
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,810
and it's wide and diverse and 27,000 to

197
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,060
basically says unless we identify what

198
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,000
those are their locations and their

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,010
quote value we're going to talk about

200
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,500
that how can you assess the risk and

201
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,560
decide how much time money and effort we

202
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,170
should put around protecting them right

203
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,560
so where are they what are they not all

204
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,450
assets are treated equal should be

205
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,690
treated equal shouldn't be I should say

206
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,860
nor do they need to the same level of

207
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,870
protection until you know what they are

208
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,300
an inventory of them you just shooting

209
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,910
in the dark and perhaps wasted money

210
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,640
okay valuable information is everywhere

211
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,730
I'm probably missing some here but from

212
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,820
medical history and claims to account

213
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,880
numbers check images pins passwords

214
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,240
drunk you name it it's everywhere yours

215
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,700
is everywhere and i want to show you

216
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,680
that and it is being exposed on a

217
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,060
regular basis data types exposed this is

218
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,500
a chart from 2012 from the from data

219
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,170
loss our cyber risk analytics you can

220
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,950
see email almost fifty five percent of

221
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,089
all the data breaches in 2012 exposed

222
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,150
email followed by password followed by

223
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,520
other miscellaneous data points and you

224
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,290
can see as it going up

225
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,029
they want to show this chart very

226
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,839
briefly this is over time that what kind

227
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,610
of data is being exposed you can see on

228
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,649
the top was named and it's coming down

229
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:05,120
whereas email is on a sharp incline also

230
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,920
by password and what we're seeing is

231
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,420
since many email addresses are being

232
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,750
used as user names and a lot of webs web

233
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,370
applications and our passwords were not

234
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,920
real discipline in that regard we're

235
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,380
using the same password for facebook as

236
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,170
we are using for our bank accounts

237
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,779
they're zeroing in on email addresses

238
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,430
and passwords because it's a good chance

239
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,740
that I can get real valuable stuff on

240
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,949
you so you can see how the attacks are

241
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,050
going after the data that produces the

242
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,250
greatest amount of opportunity and of

243
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,399
course regulations and standards demand

244
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,259
risk assessment you know this is only a

245
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,620
partial list of those that say hey you

246
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,310
need what's your risk assessments say I

247
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,600
spent some time in the financial world

248
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,339
and the examiners always walked in is

249
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,079
okay what did your risk assessments say

250
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,940
and that's what they're basing their

251
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,639
exam lon and that's what they expect us

252
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,500
to base our security controls and

253
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,920
security program on today's realities

254
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,740
data breaches this is out of our

255
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,779
database I did approximation for 2013

256
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,290
but this is a number of records so in

257
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,569
2011 about four hundred and twelve

258
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,949
million records were exposed in the

259
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:30,350
publicly reported data breaches okay

260
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,410
publicly reported data breaches which is

261
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,079
probably just a small fraction of the

262
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,149
real data breaches that actually occur

263
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,050
okay now let's look at this number the

264
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,480
red line represents the number of

265
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,779
incidents so the number of the breaches

266
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,380
themselves and you can see that 2012 is

267
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,850
all-time record of over 3100 publicly

268
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,000
reported data breaches which surpassed

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,510
the all-time record

270
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:05,100
for that in 2011 at around 1200 so my

271
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,950
point here is those trend lines are not

272
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,680
leveling off nor are they going down and

273
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,990
we all know that this isn't all the data

274
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,750
breaches that are actually occurring

275
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,110
okay new exploits so here we're talking

276
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,690
about volunteer hardware vulnerabilities

277
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,960
so on average over the last number of

278
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,380
years around 9,000 new vulnerabilities

279
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,100
have been are in fact exposed tracked

280
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,950
released that we track in our database

281
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,040
but on a cumulative deal we have over 90

282
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,740
about 92,000 software vulnerabilities

283
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,220
that need to be handled and we all know

284
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,450
especially I'm going to talk to a lot of

285
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,570
you guys just just because it's old news

286
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,300
doesn't mean it's been patched properly

287
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,200
so there's lots of exploits here

288
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,210
potential exploits why we need to really

289
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,390
assess assess our risk and just a couple

290
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,210
bullets the needs never been higher

291
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,430
anyone who captures transmits any

292
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,920
sensitive data you are actively being

293
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,560
targeted no if ands or buts about it

294
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,180
even the small banks and credit unions

295
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,760
that were under the radar for so long

296
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,940
they're not they're a treasure chest of

297
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,790
great data money cash the whole nine

298
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,390
yards we need a way in order to properly

299
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,970
focus limited resources we don't have

300
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,770
unlimited resources to a tackle

301
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,530
everything so how we going to prioritize

302
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,570
it a risk assessment offers a great

303
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,410
vehicle to be able to do that we need

304
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,100
justification for these recommendations

305
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,340
and in business terms so that we can

306
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,440
convince the people who manage our

307
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,200
budgets that this is in fact what needs

308
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
to be done and then of course in our

309
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,990
business environment we can't afford

310
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,810
costly inappropriate controls I've seen

311
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,790
numerous times where they have elaborate

312
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,130
controls around assets that are just not

313
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,200
that valuable to the organization when

314
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,970
it comes to you know being it being

315
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,180
exposed and then lastly it can be

316
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,980
thought of is kind of the first line of

317
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,360
defense

318
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,040
for implementing a security program okay

319
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,660
I want to switch gears here a little bit

320
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,930
talk a little bit about definitions so

321
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,180
that when we go through that you want a

322
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,370
same page at least a little bit all

323
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,440
right so of course everybody knows the

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,209
definition information security right

325
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:32,190
the preservation of CIA some people say

326
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,649
ciaa adding accountability but all these

327
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,870
other terms so what we're trying to

328
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,600
avoid of course is a breach in CIA

329
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,730
that's the best way to kind of get that

330
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,670
point across to the business manage your

331
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,070
small business owner and at the heart of

332
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,430
all of that is a risk assessment so you

333
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,310
can properly know where these assets are

334
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,750
and how you're going to focus on

335
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,560
protecting them first some definitions

336
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,970
see if any of these if you have others

337
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,279
i'd love to hear oh so we will hear this

338
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,670
one it's a combination risk is

339
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,810
consequence of an event and the

340
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,329
probability of that event so I'm

341
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,010
explaining this to a business manager

342
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,899
and they look at me they go consequence

343
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,399
what are you talking about probability

344
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,100
how do I figure that out how about

345
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,640
impact times threat times vulnerability

346
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,089
okay what does that mean impacted your

347
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,810
organization when a threat exploits of

348
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,480
vulnerability the effect of uncertainty

349
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,160
on objectives again positive and

350
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,570
negative once again coming out of the

351
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,500
new 31,000 so then what's a threat in

352
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,779
potential danger to an asset or business

353
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,050
objective a vulnerability is a weakness

354
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,870
that provides a door for that threat to

355
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,440
exploit the organization and then a risk

356
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,500
score is a potential impact to the

357
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,660
business based on the likelihood of that

358
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,640
threat agent taking advantage of that

359
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,760
vulnerability okay Oh reasonable so far

360
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,740
i mean the words maybe a little bit

361
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,299
different but you kind of get the gist

362
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,000
of how it comes together right okay now

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,299
the chinese have two words for risk

364
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,168
anybody know what they are

365
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,940
opportunities one here we go danger Plus

366
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,280
opportunity makes a lot of sense they

367
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,880
were way ahead of iso 31000 because

368
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,920
that's for this both things you and

369
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,540
that's that's part of your throne of

370
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,680
business okay risk assessment it's made

371
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,900
up of three processes and the previous

372
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,220
speaker mentioned that risk

373
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,120
identification to find recognize and

374
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,330
describe the risks the analysis of those

375
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,390
risks understand what they are the

376
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,840
impact the consequence what level of

377
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,120
risk they're based on current controls

378
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,880
and then of course evaluation compares

379
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,180
the analysis what'swhat's determined an

380
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,200
appropriate risk treatment ok risk

381
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,030
treatment first we all know these

382
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,370
options right you have risk or four

383
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,120
options you can avoid it stop doing that

384
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,990
that causes that you can transfer it you

385
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,430
know buy some insurance and I'm sure

386
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,870
their insurance people here there'll be

387
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,050
glad to sell you some of that implement

388
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,220
safeguards or controls and then of

389
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,570
course you get to the point where you're

390
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,380
going to knowingly accept it as residual

391
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,320
risk right which is the next definition

392
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,620
it's what's left over after you've

393
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,150
implemented a reach treatment or put a

394
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,370
control in place etc that makes sense

395
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,980
and it's that residual risk that

396
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,480
management needs to acknowledge be aware

397
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,890
of and knowingly accept okay my personal

398
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,690
definition now here we're going to get

399
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,670
into how I'm going to try to help you

400
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,620
understand what we're talking about here

401
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,210
because right now it's just a bunch of

402
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,450
academic stuff alright so I like

403
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,520
starting out risk is to count is the

404
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,700
combination of consequence of an event

405
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,440
and the probability of that event

406
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,660
happening okay how do we really

407
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,300
interpret this we can use it so

408
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,000
consequence means the impact to the

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,700
organization of a potential breach to

410
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,780
CIA okay so if the availability is

411
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,750
impacted

412
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,790
that's a consequence and what does that

413
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,040
do to the organization confidentiality

414
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,800
integrity I kind of call that asset

415
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,410
value here i'm not talking about it's a

416
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,660
thousand dollars to replace that item

417
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,790
etc it's the impact of your organization

418
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,520
not the particular cost of that item

419
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,040
okay that's contrary to some other risk

420
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,900
assessment approaches who want to put a

421
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,470
dollar value on the items and i find it

422
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,710
can it confuses the the audience for

423
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,810
this kind of conversation or we call it

424
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,690
the security impact you know but let's

425
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,280
right now use asset value probability is

426
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,350
hard for most people to grasp if you

427
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,920
leave it in 11 section so the

428
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,630
probability of a threat occurring is

429
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,990
really two pieces one the threat

430
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,150
likelihood what is the likelihood of

431
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,610
that threat impacting your asset times

432
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,710
the probability of the exposure to that

433
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,540
threat considering existing controls

434
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,790
vulnerability exposure okay so you have

435
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,560
threat likelihood and I want to go

436
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,620
through this in more detail and

437
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,420
vulnerability exposure and how we can

438
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,120
control that so that is in fact the

439
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,370
formula risk equals asset value times

440
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,890
threat likelihood times vulnerability

441
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,360
exposure okay so okay so okay so where

442
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,250
do we get these numbers from you know

443
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,860
how we get these well of course if we

444
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,260
had lots and lots of historical data

445
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,910
like maybe the insurance industry does

446
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,100
actuarial tables things like that we

447
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,930
could do this in a real quantitative

448
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,370
method real data real numbers not

449
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,120
rankings well that's not what we have in

450
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,360
our in our business we have more of what

451
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,820
i like to call qualitative analysis some

452
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,430
like to call it subjective but i like

453
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,110
the word qualitative a little bit better

454
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,440
but so we do use common terms we will

455
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,930
set up you know 1251 that

456
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,020
and low to very high that type of thing

457
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,510
so it's relative risk that we're looking

458
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,480
at again trying to separate the really

459
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,350
high value asset from the real low value

460
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,900
and then of course those in between that

461
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,010
makes sense okay so I'm going to

462
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,040
summarize that the definition part with

463
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,350
with this if you look at this picture

464
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,110
and based on the definitions we just

465
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,840
talked about do you see anything there's

466
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,130
any of this representing you think

467
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,510
anybody I'll help you out if this guy is

468
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,810
considered the asset or maybe the USB

469
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,150
stick that's in his pocket is the asset

470
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,450
what else do you see there what's that

471
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,100
the cotton what are they the threats

472
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,620
right so we got some threats there we go

473
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,179
got some threats what else do you see

474
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,020
lines one ability yeah anything else

475
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,769
he done in control and a stick right

476
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:47,500
right exactly so the vulnerability you

477
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,149
know could be he's got the wrong shoes

478
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:53,289
on where he's a little unsteady or why

479
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,629
in the world or they was he why is this

480
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,940
process have him walking across this

481
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,610
line anyway right we want to avoid this

482
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,980
whatever it is he's trying to do doesn't

483
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,929
make any sense and yeah I think a

484
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,840
safeguard where control would be would

485
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,919
be the stick right or even better one is

486
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,830
to is to let him tightrope across some

487
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,200
other kind of water without alligators

488
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,450
and and the ship and they're both being

489
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,970
down there so that's that's really what

490
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,580
we're what we're dealing with here okay

491
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,850
excellent okay now let's get into the

492
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,129
process of risk assessments and bear

493
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:32,799
with me through this one okay all right

494
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,620
so this is really how risk assessment

495
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,190
works you have all these steps and then

496
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,340
at the end a miracle occurs and you get

497
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,409
a risk report and that's what you give

498
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:47,009
the management that's how it works now

499
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,299
sometimes they say I we need a little

500
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,360
bit more detail right here and I like

501
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,090
the heading to and I stole this from God

502
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,210
I never heard of before Ambrose the risk

503
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,769
assessment is kind of coming up with the

504
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,409
best method of accomplishing an

505
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:05,769
accidental result and to me that that's

506
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:09,159
kind of what this is it's and by the way

507
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,600
once you do it once you can going to

508
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,909
accidentally do it again but this kind

509
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,799
of gives you some relative repeatability

510
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,720
so you can pay our last year's risk

511
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,539
assessment to this one so the process

512
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:20,889
i'm going to walk you through doesn't

513
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,200
have quite that many steps but it does

514
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,539
still arrive at the same accent than a

515
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,529
result ok so here we go first and

516
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,259
foremost we have to identify a business

517
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,039
process or the department or the unit or

518
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,279
whatever we need a proper scope before

519
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,899
we get into risk assessment anybody

520
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:43,809
disagree with that we need to understand

521
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:45,820
we need to have it into context as we

522
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,519
talked to earlier if you try to say I'm

523
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,720
going to do a risk assessment of the

524
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,389
whole company you're dead okay you'll

525
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,090
never get done

526
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,610
ever finish it'll never be acceptable

527
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,070
you need to define what it is you're

528
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,669
going to do okay and then of course

529
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,190
within that Prop within that process or

530
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,470
scope you need to identify the assets

531
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,289
and go through that rating process which

532
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,700
i'm going to show you here in a second

533
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,220
to come up with the value all assets are

534
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,070
not equal so you want to segregate them

535
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,380
you want to prioritize them you want to

536
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,539
identify the threats and of course the

537
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,029
likelihood of the threat occurring you

538
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:27,179
want to identify take inventory of your

539
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,419
controls which may be the first time you

540
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,220
actually consider a we're not going bad

541
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,890
we do it a lot of things and you want to

542
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,450
be able to take it take it goes into

543
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,320
consideration when you come up with your

544
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,110
analysis identified vulnerabilities and

545
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,470
rate the potential exposure right coming

546
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,149
up with the formula that we were working

547
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,659
on then we want to calculate that

548
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,960
formula develop now we'll go now that

549
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,020
we've developed the risk scores we can

550
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,750
prioritize the higher ones to the lower

551
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,700
ones and we start with our limited

552
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,690
resources and money we start fixing as

553
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,760
we can the ones with the highest risk

554
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,309
until we run out of money and then we

555
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,600
get to the point where our management

556
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,490
has to either give me more money or

557
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,840
we're going to accept these risks

558
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,230
knowingly accepting these risks right

559
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,350
and then of course define and accept

560
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,380
those residual risks and magically the

561
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,000
risk assessment report materializes but

562
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,070
then we have to then implement these

563
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,908
controls yes sir

564
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,740
yes and the red box is attempting to say

565
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,880
that define what the acceptable risk is

566
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,460
your acceptable appetite and then that

567
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,380
determines your residual risk yes that's

568
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,140
the part that addresses that very

569
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,240
important part and we'll talk about that

570
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,120
a sec now the thing in the middle with

571
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,070
it kind of rotating means that you're

572
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,620
kind of never done right it's just

573
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,350
you're going around this thing as often

574
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,039
as you can and then of course once you

575
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,470
put these controls in place you are

576
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,809
going to basically add a control lower

577
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:18,809
your vulnerability exposure by virtue of

578
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:21,360
that control but then you have to test

579
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,809
to see if it really worked right and i'm

580
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,950
going to show you that if i say my

581
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,840
vulnerability exposure is up is a five

582
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,360
and i do two controls now i think it's

583
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,470
too did those controls really impact my

584
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,600
vulnerability or not so you have to

585
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
think through test security control test

586
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,690
plans okay which is not a topic here but

587
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,019
nonetheless it's not one done and leave

588
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:47,519
it alone you're constantly it's of

589
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,610
growing and living thing ok now I'm

590
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,350
going to briefly go through each one of

591
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,870
these boxes to kind of give you a

592
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,330
thought of what we're doing here so when

593
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,909
it comes to scope it's basically system

594
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,380
characterization right you're familiar

595
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,210
with that word what does the department

596
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,580
the business process how does the

597
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,070
information flow very key right how the

598
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,230
information flows generally speaking

599
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,850
when you do that with a small business

600
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,370
owner it is a eye-opening experience

601
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,740
because they have no idea where the

602
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,510
information is coming from who's doing

603
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,090
what to whom the requirements associated

604
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,730
with it people users you can see the

605
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,710
rest so in essence you're trying to

606
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,289
define what it is that you are in fact

607
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,769
going to do a risk assessment on ok now

608
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,899
how about assets here's a quick and

609
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:36,570
dirty way of doing that ok so I have a

610
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,720
set name I encourage them to say okay

611
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,940
let's categorize let's classify these

612
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,639
assets you know is it public is it

613
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,559
confidential is it just internal

614
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,320
sensitive you know what where do you

615
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,840
have

616
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,179
do you want to guard these assets and

617
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:54,640
they're not all classified the same then

618
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,510
we have three columns CIA we each of

619
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:03,159
those columns goes 125 okay 125 simple

620
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,080
you go through and you say okay web

621
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,640
server depending on what's on and of

622
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,770
course it's only sensitive data not

623
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,860
confidential so in confidentiality if I

624
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,559
was breached it would only be a medium

625
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,799
impact to the organization integrity ah

626
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,620
it has more impact of your organization

627
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,679
and of course availability we're at a

628
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,289
standstill if that thing's not available

629
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:28,270
to me you see these are decisions that

630
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,570
the business owner makes not me not a

631
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,820
security guy but generally the business

632
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,130
owner to product manager and this in

633
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,760
this case a simple average okay simple

634
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,419
rhythmic with net average and so so you

635
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:46,240
picture this inventory of assets this

636
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,399
helps you then say if I'm going to spend

637
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,470
money I think I want to zero in on the

638
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,230
online banking application because it's

639
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,570
a five versus a four versus a three you

640
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,149
with me and so in the process we would

641
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:01,840
then filter those and get all the higher

642
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,090
numbers to the top and that's where we

643
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,610
would start our analysis of threats and

644
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,640
vulnerabilities with me simple-minded

645
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,190
you know maybe mathematically it doesn't

646
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,919
make sense for to add and whatever maybe

647
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:17,230
we should multiply we can argue about

648
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,950
that I've seen I've seen both okay now

649
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,870
here is where the qualitative part comes

650
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,419
in 125 we make these up okay let's start

651
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:31,029
with five people always know what really

652
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,760
would hurt them so if I say that that

653
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,059
asset is rated as a 5-4 confidentiality

654
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,909
it means it's going to severely impact

655
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:41,559
my operation is going to be cetera et

656
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:43,929
cetera you can read that the one on the

657
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:47,020
bottom it's not really going to do much

658
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,700
to me and then of course we start

659
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,600
negotiating 3 4 3 2 3 & 4 you with me to

660
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,690
basically get varying degrees and so

661
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,070
we're attempting

662
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,429
asset value value area is to quality no

663
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:04,120
subjectively right qualitatively zero in

664
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,600
and rate each of those CIA makes sense

665
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,299
now we can make these anything we want

666
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,639
whatever is comfortable to you whatever

667
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,980
fits your business model best all right

668
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,559
these are your definitions so you can

669
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:20,080
rate them pretty well it's not trying to

670
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,730
understand what do I mean by this it's

671
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,120
what you mean by that makes sense okay

672
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,179
all right let's talk about threats now

673
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,070
there are dozens and dozens and dozens

674
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,169
of threats that we can come up with

675
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:34,330
here's just a quick spattering of

676
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,700
threats in fact I always like to use the

677
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,159
new to natural disasters hurricanes and

678
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:40,779
I'll use as an example here a little bit

679
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:43,210
but you can see these are things that

680
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,659
can possibly threaten the CIA of our

681
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:50,139
data and we wanted to determine whether

682
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:52,360
or not these have any potential impact

683
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,210
if master gets a vulnerability to a

684
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,019
particular asset okay make sense

685
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,009
organization may have a different list

686
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:03,639
or combination or others same thing here

687
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:06,220
now we have to determine the threat

688
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,669
likelihood of that particular threat

689
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:14,049
I'll use the easy example I'm living on

690
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,230
the coast of Florida so let's say the

691
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,149
threat is a hurricane hmmm the

692
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:24,179
likelihood of a hurricane impacting my

693
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:28,779
data center is probably very high right

694
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:31,299
certainly well maybe not it's like

695
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,129
likely to occur multiple times per week

696
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:35,679
that's not really the case it's more

697
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,320
likely turn depending on the time of the

698
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,019
year more like maybe monthly whatever so

699
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,629
you can zero in with real numbers that

700
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,629
you make up from very low to very high

701
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:49,600
and be able to use what that means the

702
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,509
likelihood of that threat occurring okay

703
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,340
now of course herrick aid the threat of

704
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,720
hurricane isn't going to have the same

705
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,419
likelihood of occurrence in Omaha but

706
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:00,580
they have different issues like

707
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,179
tornadoes what it floods whatever

708
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,159
with me and so we can kind of zero in on

709
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,899
the threat likelihood same way about

710
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:11,169
hacking or anything else all right now

711
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:14,200
this is easy one before you look at your

712
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,759
vulnerability you want to take inventory

713
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,619
are the controls that you have in place

714
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:21,279
so here I am a data center I'm on the

715
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,950
beach you know in jacksonville beach

716
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,559
with my data center and i'm thinking

717
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,799
about hurricanes what controls do i have

718
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,539
in place ah do I have concrete walls you

719
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:37,240
know do I have insurance what are the

720
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,970
things that I'm trying to reduce the

721
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,059
vulnerability and the list of controls

722
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:45,220
that you have in place need to be need

723
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,289
to be dressed now let's talk

724
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,299
vulnerability remember this it's a

725
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,460
weakness that might be exploited by a

726
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,879
threat right here are just a quick

727
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:57,460
sampling of these time from inadequate

728
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,450
fire prevention to insufficient training

729
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,740
security controls testing etc and again

730
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,069
here vulnerability exposure again I'm

731
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:12,030
making these up with the business owner

732
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,760
very low vulnerability exposure because

733
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,619
the vulnerability is very hard to

734
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,449
exploit or the security controls in

735
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,369
place to protect the ass that are very

736
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:24,819
strong okay so let's think about I'm on

737
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:27,609
the shore of the ocean I'm in my data

738
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,929
center I'm talking about hurricanes but

739
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,780
I have a concrete building right and all

740
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,969
my important stuff is on the second

741
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,639
floor with no windows ok so my

742
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,168
vulnerability exposure in that

743
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:42,879
particular scenario is a little

744
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,819
different than B&N a you know a wooden

745
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:47,829
structure at the end of the pier you're

746
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:49,329
assuming I'm saying so a very simple

747
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:55,239
example but that's how we can rate this

748
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,329
between I am highly vulnerable or I'm

749
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,339
not very vulnerable that makes sense

750
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:05,020
again same 125 that I make up that you

751
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,270
make up that you understand so that when

752
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,339
you do this risk assessment again next

753
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:12,190
year you can compare it to one you did

754
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,900
before because it's not something a

755
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,579
consultant told you that is what you

756
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:16,270
created

757
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,480
okay now let's look at this real fast

758
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,070
calculating the risk score remember the

759
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,000
my favorite formula is asset value x

760
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
threat likelihood vulnerability exposure

761
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,840
so here we go I asset ID because we're

762
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,370
going to get down to the assets within

763
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,680
the scope its brief description and

764
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,170
remember how we calculated the asset

765
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,630
value before right CIA and how is

766
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,030
exploited then week then we have the

767
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,390
threat likelihood 125 right then we

768
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,850
named a vulnerability and what its

769
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,550
exposure is and then of course we

770
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,050
multiply two three together and

771
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,460
underneath of that score we're going to

772
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,010
have a number right and that number is

773
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:02,320
going to be somewhere on a chart like

774
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,840
this right the maximum that it can be is

775
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,340
125 right 5 times 5 times 5 125 you can

776
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,080
make those numbers anything you want I

777
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,160
had a argument with a NCUA examiner one

778
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,410
time he said oh because you're only

779
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,320
going 125 on the value it's not the same

780
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,700
because you got 12 25 on the probability

781
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,970
again what so he wanted me to make the

782
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,200
125 on the value 1 225 so now my number

783
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,400
is 625 I love what okay whatever you

784
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,490
want but it's a relative thing to help

785
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,420
you segregate and prioritize ok now the

786
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,840
colors so let me ask you this well this

787
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,290
organization was yours what is your risk

788
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:57,130
appetite what number no but this is your

789
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,280
business and this this these this these

790
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,010
numbers and this legend over here they

791
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,840
tells you what your acceptable risk

792
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,180
level is so what's my risk appetite what

793
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,800
number 40 right because that's when at

794
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,480
the highest number

795
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,890
although I'm going to keep my eye on it

796
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,529
I'm going to accept it so in essence

797
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:24,059
management has concluded that anything

798
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:28,650
between 1 and 125 that's 40 or below I'm

799
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,670
going to accept that risk so my my job

800
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,059
is to anything above 40 I'm going to try

801
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,609
to implement a security control where

802
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:39,960
I'm going to avoid it right or I'm going

803
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,819
to transfer I'm going to try to lower

804
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:44,730
that to the acceptable risk level that

805
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,509
makes sense okay now let's see how we do

806
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:50,250
that and here's another example a little

807
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,250
more simplistic in nature instead of

808
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,069
using 125 we're just using low medium

809
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,470
and high a lot of organizations do this

810
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,359
low medium and high so you can see here

811
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,240
over on the threat likelihood is it's

812
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,160
low medium and high vulnerability

813
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,250
exposure low medium and high and then

814
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,829
asset value what we kept that is very

815
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:13,500
low of the very high so in essence what

816
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,539
we're trying to determine let's say my

817
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:18,180
threat likelihood is high my

818
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,099
vulnerability exposure we judge as

819
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,859
medium that and then of course the

820
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,319
impact of your organization is high that

821
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:28,289
says that my risk is high there are

822
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,240
organizations that use this some this

823
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,450
very simple non numbered approach to

824
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,390
figure out how to prioritize the risks

825
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,240
make sense you follow the flow i'm

826
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,789
trying to create here all right let's

827
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:44,160
talk about rich treatment plan what is a

828
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,349
rich treatment plan that always throws a

829
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,900
lot of people does that mean well if we

830
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,599
start with the risk calculation over

831
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,759
here and again that's that risk score

832
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,309
that came from the previous box and then

833
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,200
we decide what ours are treatment

834
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,339
remember those avoid transfer accept or

835
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,650
excuse me control and then we always

836
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,269
want to say if you're going to transfer

837
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:07,920
it or accept it you know what's your

838
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,009
rationale you know what did you Raju do

839
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,440
that and then if we're not going to

840
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,970
accept or transfer we're going to

841
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,339
control it what is the control you're

842
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,079
going to implement and when you

843
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,109
implement a control your vulnerability

844
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,589
exposure number changes right otherwise

845
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:27,690
why would you do it you want to reduce

846
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,509
your vulnerability exposure

847
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,699
by adding this control whether it's

848
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:34,939
training or firewall whatever it might

849
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:39,409
be that means you have a new risk score

850
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:41,659
right because now I've gone from a for

851
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,939
vulnerability I've gone baby down to a

852
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:47,089
three so three is the number that's

853
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:48,559
going to automatically by the

854
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,439
calculation lower your risk score is it

855
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:55,309
40 or below yeah not quite I have to

856
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,799
consider another control you with me

857
00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:00,619
we're trying to narrow that

858
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:03,889
vulnerability gap okay all right and

859
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:06,619
then of course over here which doesn't

860
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,569
show very well you have what is your

861
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:10,519
action going to be who's going to own it

862
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,139
and what's the target date to implement

863
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:16,309
okay all right all right so reviewing

864
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:18,049
residual risk it is management

865
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,599
responsibilities as a security

866
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,880
professional we need to work with

867
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,130
management to help them understand what

868
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,289
it is and what it means and help them to

869
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:29,209
define it and then of course each

870
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,309
company like the gentleman said I don't

871
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:32,509
know what's my company what do i do

872
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:35,719
right that's it depends on you know it

873
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,349
compliance responsibilities threats etc

874
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:41,539
okay quickly on the risk assessment

875
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,699
report I want to get to a couple of the

876
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:47,269
things and I'm running out of time basic

877
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:50,359
introduction the scope so when you when

878
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,399
you're turning in a report that some

879
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,779
thought external party is going to

880
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:54,949
review or even manager is going to

881
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:56,149
review you need to understand what the

882
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:58,009
scope is remember that characterization

883
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:01,699
part identify your approach which is

884
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:02,809
kind of what we just kind of went

885
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:05,259
through and then the various results

886
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:09,529
okay all right so implementing risk

887
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:11,689
treatment plans here are just three

888
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:14,689
quick examples say one of my tasks is

889
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,459
going to be the presentation to the

890
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:19,279
board about the results it has could a

891
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:20,389
big dick and I'm gonna probably need

892
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:23,929
money so we define who the owner is we

893
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:25,519
attempt to estimate how many man days

894
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,219
this is going to involve a priority one

895
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,689
two three we're still about those

896
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:31,459
priorities guys because we only have

897
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:34,009
limited resources and then obviously you

898
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:36,030
manage the percent complete and

899
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,300
so that kind of wraps that part up all

900
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,460
right so here's what I want to get to in

901
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,310
summary if I only have one slide to talk

902
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,690
to you about risk assessment this would

903
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,920
be it so bear with me here everybody

904
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,740
understand the formula here right asset

905
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,560
value threat likelihood vulnerability

906
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,710
exposure if you if you give me some

907
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,330
latitude and say that the multiplication

908
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,550
of that equals risk and risk is

909
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,170
represented by the area under the

910
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,320
triangle okay I have no idea if that

911
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,840
would be mathematically correct but let

912
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,920
this bear with me that that's

913
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,780
representing that what am I really

914
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,040
trying to do what can I do can I really

915
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,490
change the asset value maybe over time

916
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,520
things become less sensitive right but

917
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,320
right now I can't do anything about

918
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,170
asset value can I change the threat

919
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,090
likelihood of a hurricane in Florida I

920
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,780
do anything about that so what am I left

921
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,290
to do vulnerability exposure I've gotta

922
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,300
change my vulnerability exposure so I

923
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,030
implemented control and by implementing

924
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,300
that control I've changed the area under

925
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,500
the triangle now what I'm trying to

926
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,120
depict here is that the threat

927
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,980
likelihood line has remained the same

928
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,600
length okay I'm trying to just bend it

929
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,960
over I'm bending it over to reach this

930
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,540
line which now represents a shorter

931
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,900
vulnerability exposure make sense and

932
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,750
then of course I do it again and then

933
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,920
perhaps again and again and I'm down

934
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,260
here to a different risk but what about

935
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,830
that risk is it an acceptable level of

936
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,510
risk and of course you would do that

937
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,270
each time you add a control come up with

938
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,860
a new risk score and mi at or below my

939
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,020
vulnerability I'm sorry I except the

940
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,290
risk level to make sense this in essence

941
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,250
is what we're really trying to do

942
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,660
setting priorities and spending those

943
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,290
those those of limited resources okay

944
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,590
some lessons learned all businesses are

945
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,019
all processes do not have the same

946
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:52,199
impact right very much so critical

947
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,999
information assets include more than

948
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:57,149
just IT assets it's not just an IT deal

949
00:43:57,149 --> 00:44:00,539
it's a management deal information

950
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:03,899
assets are not valued the same risk

951
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:07,219
scores help us prioritize our decisions

952
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:10,169
lowering risk scores is a really a cost

953
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:13,799
benefit analysis or exercise because

954
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:16,759
these security controls don't come free

955
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:20,249
right they come with some level of cost

956
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:23,519
and it's important for business and IT

957
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:25,709
to acknowledge the responsibility of

958
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:27,509
risk ownership and you guys got that

959
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:30,689
question right is not the IT / security

960
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:33,119
guy or gal with responsibility to accept

961
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,239
risk to guide your organization of how

962
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,059
to change the exposure to lower the risk

963
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,039
but they are not in a position to say

964
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:43,199
well what's up there is no it's a

965
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,989
business owner right and then it does

966
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:48,869
require some consistent terminology and

967
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,569
it's really a foundation for decision

968
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:56,099
making all right so remember risk

969
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,429
assessment is more about heading in a

970
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:02,249
direction than it is perfection I've

971
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:04,139
talked to so many people who said you

972
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,939
never you would never be able to

973
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:07,739
determine the asset value of this system

974
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,299
this so therefore it's a waste of time

975
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:12,329
it's not true we're not coming up with a

976
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,539
value necessarily we're coming up with a

977
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:18,179
priority ranking of where this asset is

978
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:20,880
more important than this one does that

979
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,169
make sense okay and there's no perfect

980
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:28,829
risk assessment I'm just trying to do a

981
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:31,679
risk assessment and you you fumble with

982
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,619
every element here that's okay the level

983
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,619
of education and training communication

984
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,779
that was going to take place is going to

985
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:40,859
be phenomenal and your organization

986
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:43,529
you're better off and besides as soon as

987
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:44,759
you spend you know those three months

988
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:46,559
doing that risk assessment it's obsolete

989
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,649
anyway because emerging threats have

990
00:45:49,649 --> 00:45:51,119
occurred or

991
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,410
whatever so it's not about what they say

992
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,420
real estate its location location

993
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,279
location and if we're talking about it's

994
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:01,829
get going it's you're heading in the

995
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:03,390
right direction not worried about

996
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,859
perfection okay and that summarizes and

997
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:10,740
hey I got two minutes left so I

998
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,720

999

argue with me please trying to get

1001
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,390
educated and figure out a way to help

1002
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,549
