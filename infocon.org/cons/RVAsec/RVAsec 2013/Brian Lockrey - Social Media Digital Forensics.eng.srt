00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,200
good afternoon everyone my name's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan</font>

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,300
lockrey I'm with the international

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,339
association of digital forensics

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:39,010
investigators and this is social media

5
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,710
forensics and kinds of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

6
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:45,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">can look at on your social media sites</font>

7
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,699
and hopefully it in 45<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes you'll</font>

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,809
never use social media again because you

9
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,210
can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

10
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:53,440
investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you keep in mind</font>

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,839
everything that you put out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,750
public information so nothing that we

13
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:02,589
have in our databases are anything

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,800
confidential okay um<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this is a</font>

15
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:08,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">slideshow we use for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,789
presentation but later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of</font>

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,210
the show<font color="#E5E5E5"> remind me and I'll give you</font>

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,190
some links to some some Google+

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,759
communities that we have and also some

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,220
other gamer accounts and stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get on so okay why are</font>

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:27,548
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in social media forensics</font>

23
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:30,039
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of good reasons we my</font>

24
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:33,880
background tends to be more in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the area</font>

25
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:36,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> criminal investigations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not law</font>

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,740
enforcement but I do workshops and

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,460
seminars for law enforcement I've been

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,850
on both sides of the bench both from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

29
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:49,509
prosecutor side in on the defense side

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:53,139
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've you know I've seen different</font>

31
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,780
instances of how people both prosecuting

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,119
and try to defend cases I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved with missing persons cases</font>

34
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:05,930
where we've used social media to

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:08,600
track down<font color="#E5E5E5"> where people are or where we</font>

36
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:11,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they are where they've been it's</font>

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably a better analogy also</font>

38
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,490
maybe who some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their friends are so</font>

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they hooked up with some new you</font>

40
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:23,150
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cult somewhere out in Texas or</font>

41
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:27,850
someplace we can home in on where they

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:30,140
might be I've done cases for infidelity

43
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,760
obviously quite a bit of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

44
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,760
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet question</font>

45
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,890
oh really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we get the audio guy to</font>

46
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:45,030
crank up the audio a little bit too I'll

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak a little louder I'm sorry okay</font>

48
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,990
infidelity is a big thing we see a lot

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,200
of that across the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

50
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:56,920
especially with social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media Facebook</font>

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,940
Twitter even some instances on linkedin

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,920
believe it or not many of the other

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,050
speakers here are talking about malware

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,059
so I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a whole great</font>

55
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,030
deal about malware you're all know we're

56
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,000
experts already however we we do see

57
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,990
malware spreading through some of the

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,610
social networks and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been involved</font>

59
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:23,800
in both paid and unpaid performances of

60
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,470
actually capturing now we're off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,390
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media sites for investigation</font>

62
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:34,960
purposes I actually was lucky enough if

63
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:38,350
that's a word to to capture the very

64
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,030
first Twitter virus that they went out

65
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,030
several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago about four or five</font>

66
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where Twitter used to allow</font>

67
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:49,630
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have virtually anything in your</font>

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,880
profile page so somebody came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a</font>

69
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,630
creative little<font color="#E5E5E5"> script that would embed</font>

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,000
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> java app inside of your profile</font>

71
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,590
page<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would do is you</font>

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,870
would invite all you know you'd fight

73
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,540
all your friends to go look at your

74
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,550
profile page which would then infect

75
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,310
their profile page<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the thing went</font>

76
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,470
you know viral rather quickly so there

77
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:16,459
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some instances of malware that can</font>

78
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,680
can be traced as well certainly there's

79
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,260
a number of scams going on on the

80
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet I don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk much about</font>

a company the gentleman earlier alluded

86
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,890
to this that sometimes companies will

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,169
have insiders within the company that

88
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,729
are collecting information and

89
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:52,100
forwarding that information on to

90
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:57,890
competitors I had a case I did by four

91
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:01,280
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago where a person was</font>

93
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,200
a competing company and every time

94
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,180
become the company that he worked for

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,630
would get an RFQ to quote on some

96
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,600
project he would he would then forward

97
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,659
that information to his wife and her

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,970
company would then submit a you know

99
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,600
lower bid for the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of widgets</font>

of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic was done actually done</font>

102
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,840
through email although there were a few

get revealed and his wife get revealed

but all of his<font color="#CCCCCC"> girlfriends got revealed</font>

109
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:54,710
too so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only did he end up in jail</font>

110
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,110
but I think ended up divorced too so not

pornography obviously we we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:10,400
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that on Facebook or LinkedIn or</font>

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,950
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter for that regard a little</font>

bit on tumblr probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so much</font>

these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only social networks</font>

122
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,519
that are out there we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

123
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:30,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">database of over probably close to 400</font>

124
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,699
different social networks that we that

125
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:36,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a count on that we use for</font>

126
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:41,319
tracking different things and I

127
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:45,099
literally probably get an invite to a

128
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:47,709
new social network once or twice<font color="#CCCCCC"> a week</font>

129
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:50,498
I mean they they continued<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spring up</font>

130
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:52,839
for all kinds of you name it everybody's

131
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:54,909
got a social network I mean like you

132
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,579
know people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out of jobs people</font>

133
00:06:54,909 --> 00:07:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jobs people you</font>

134

everybody's got a social network there's

136
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:08,079
sites like Nang or sites like groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> com</font>

137
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,079
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different where you can</font>

138
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,929
actually create your own social<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

139
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:18,129
so there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we used in England</font>

140
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:19,869
for one of our networks actually now

141
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,179
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> towards yeah more</font>

142
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:23,919
which is it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> use Yammer here in your</font>

143
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:26,349

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bit of quite a bit of traffic that you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't necessarily agree with 140 million</font>

active users one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see on twitter</font>

192
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,650
is that you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people that</font>

193
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,160
sign up for it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll use it</font>

194
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you know like two weeks and then</font>

195
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,500
they never use it again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

196
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">they may have 140 million users but I</font>

197
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,330
wouldn't necessarily say<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're all</font>

198
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:20,029
active users and about half the world's

199
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:24,020
Twitter users or from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the USA which is</font>

200
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:26,110
not surprising and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty-five percent of</font>

201
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,050
the Twitter users or female so

202
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:34,300
interesting statistic there and the

203
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,219
average Twitter user has 27 followers

204
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,900
so I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be your average</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

205
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,550

what does a Twitter one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

209
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,880
the syntax if you will of some of these

210
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,280
URLs that are used for some of these

211
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,210
social networks and if this seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,980
you know old school stuff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you bear</font>

213
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,130
with me because when we start talking

214
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> investigation and when</font>

215
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,050
we're running scanners across machines

216
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,310
that have been collected as evidence you

217
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,370
know these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

218
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we set up you know grep expressions</font>

219
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,460
and rug expressions and things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

220
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,480
so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons why I'm</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spent a little bit of time on</font>

223
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:31,689
tokens that are used in such so this

224
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:35,440
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a typical Twitter URL syntax</font>

225
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:46,090
twitter.com slash user name or twitter

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:48,820
ID the my own slide to some of the thing

Twitter X by using that second URL where

if you search for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q equals twitpic it'll</font>

237
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:32,020
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with pretty much any URL that</font>

your geographical area or so to speak

242
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,580
you could set up an advanced search on

speak so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does is I get you a</font>

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people used instagram with</font>

don't see quite as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> instagram links</font>

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,670
would come up with a red<font color="#CCCCCC"> x expression</font>

sites that are out there and there's

283
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,620
early hundreds of them and so we we have

284
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,030
some software that will just

285
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,170
automatically go out there and start

286
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:05,120
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them all over</font>

287
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:07,719
place but smugmug is one prosti rias is

288
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,800
one mobile picture there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> flickr</font>

289
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,570
there's twit<font color="#CCCCCC"> goo twitter pics there's</font>

290
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,930
little like I centers a little literally

291
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:21,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundreds of them so again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for each of</font>

these different photo<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing sites you</font>

293
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:28,430
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you understand</font>

294
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:32,269
the syntax of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they use any</font>

295
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:35,209
kind of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know hash coding or any kind</font>

296
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:38,329
of embedding of usernames or user

297
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,969
numbers and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the user names and</font>

298
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,949
user numbers a little bit later but just

299
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep that in mind when you start you</font>

300
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:47,300
know searching a computer looking for

301
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,220
evidence that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just some of the</font>

302
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:56,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">keywords that you have to search for as</font>

303
00:15:49,220 --> 00:16:00,410
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for example if if Moshe</font>

304
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michelle Obama would post a photo using</font>

305
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:07,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter photo sharing service the</font>

306
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">the syntax of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URL that you would</font>

307
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:17,390
discover would look something pretty

308
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:19,939
similar to wine<font color="#CCCCCC"> three there and pay</font>

309
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:23,360
close attention to that number because

310
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that number will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key for other things</font>

311
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:31,160
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually trace this back to a</font>

312
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:37,000
status message or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can trace it back</font>

313
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,000
to two other artifacts as well

314
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,470
and

315
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,689
again you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a similar kind of</font>

316
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,649
instance on yfrog and

317
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,029
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have an exact</font>

318
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,070
number of that but if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go look</font>

319
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:59,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">at a yfrog accounts you can get one and</font>

320
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:06,569
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Instagram you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / p / hashcode</font>

321
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:09,220
and that the fat<font color="#E5E5E5"> / p means photo I</font>

322
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,159
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means profile one of the two</font>

323
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:16,150
and then you have the code for the photo

324
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so so in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any in any kind of</font>

325
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:22,329
Investigation we may have one or two

326
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:25,510
pieces of evidence for example we might

327
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:29,639
have a URL that's stored on a computer

328
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:33,549
out in a browser cache for example or

329
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:37,480
you may have the actual photograph

330
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:39,460
itself and what we want to be able to do

331
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,230
is now if we have the URL it's pretty

332
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,000
easy to go get the photo because we can

333
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,299
just go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet get the photo</font>

334
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,630
and match the two up if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have the</font>

335
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:51,429
photo and we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL then we</font>

336
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,260
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use some reverse techniques</font>

337
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:59,620
which i'll talk to you about a little

338
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:04,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit later okay twitter also has a new</font>

339
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,850
video network called vine dot co not c

340
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:13,059
om just not ce o--'s anybody ever you

341
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:15,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">hear use vine okay vine is a sort of</font>

342
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:18,428
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call the Twitter version of</font>

343
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:22,090
YouTube lets you bake what is it 1 1

344
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:25,419
minute or 30 seconds or it's a very

345
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:29,530
short video it's like limited something

346
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:32,910
like 60 seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something which you</font>

347
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,450
know so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say you know hey I'm at</font>

348
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,570
you know

349
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,190
RV a sack in Richmond<font color="#E5E5E5"> Virginia you know</font>

350
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,710
here's the crowd of people out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

351
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,780
that's the most you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is post you</font>

352
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,790
know one 60-second video and that's it

353
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:50,649
but you can post it through your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

354
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">stream it's I'm not sure if it's</font>

355
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,850
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> owned by Twitter or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter is</font>

356
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,980
an investor<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the company i think it</font>

357
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:00,010
was founded by a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the original</font>

358
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,200
founders of Twitter so if they don't own

359
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:07,810
it outright they are investors in that

360
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:11,110
company but you know like any photo or

361
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:13,480
video sharing service you know the it

362
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:16,000
immediately opens up the doors for all

363
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinds of interesting things to happen if</font>

364
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
you're an investigator watching somebody

365
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,460
also keep in mind that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what I'm</font>

366
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,889
talking about is things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

367
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,270
relative to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the desktop if you will to a</font>

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:36,220
desktop browser however<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

369
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,620
concepts and the same tools and the same

370
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,980
artifacts apply to mobile devices as

371
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:45,310
well cell phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you look at</font>

372
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the you know the sum of the databases</font>

373
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:51,340
that are left on cell phones when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,820
forensics on them you have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

375
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,340
of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

376
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,050
itself you might have a link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

377
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:05,290
image you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have one of these</font>

378
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:10,120
hash codes etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay twitter also</font>

379
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:12,670
has an RSS feed so if you are stalking

380
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,870
somebody keeping an eye on them watching

381
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:18,330
them whatever it is you do as an

382
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:21,189
investigator you can set up a reader

383
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,730
that will continuously monitor their

384
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter stream to extract their tweets</font>

385
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:32,780
twitter is doing away with the RSS feed

386
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:35,480
so in the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

387
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,580
I've seen it work on some of our systems

388
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,350
but other systems it doesn't work on and

389
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:44,030
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what they're doing is they're</font>

390
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:46,280
they limit it to just to certain IP

391
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,990
addresses that are registered<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

392
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,420
developers we're actually a registered

393
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter developer so we have we have</font>

394
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:56,180
some registered IP addresses but it may

395
00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:00,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">not necessarily work on your computer at</font>

396
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:05,030
home it has been an undocumented feature

397
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:07,130
but for the most part it it has worked

398
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,490
for the last four or five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spine</font>

399
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:13,340
the syntax<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that if you're using W get</font>

400
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,130
or any applications like that is that's

401
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:22,760
the syntax the middle the middle lines

402
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:30,020
there you can also sign up to get a

403
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:32,510
twitter api which is allows you to to

404
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,480
use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these services on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter</font>

405
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know normal not api people</font>

406
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,820
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to another thing</font>

407
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a twitter ID</font>

408
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:48,200
and this is important for forensics is

409
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:51,320
that what you see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen is a</font>

410
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,610
name for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see Michelle Obama</font>

411
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:59,149
as the name but within the databases

412
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,439
themselves Michelle Obama has assigned a

413
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,620
number

414
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:07,220
and that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually appears down</font>

415
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:12,110
below so each every user has a unique

416
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:14,570
number as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a screen name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why then</font>

417
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,899
is important to an investigator is

418
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:22,879
because if for some reason she would

419
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:24,860
change her name to you know mrs.

420
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,410
president or whatever to change her name

421
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:32,479
to her number remains the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now</font>

422
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously if she deletes her account and</font>

423
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,950
creates a new account she gets a new

424
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:40,330
number but if she just<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes her name</font>

425
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:43,820
or she just changes her profile image

426
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:46,639
that number still remains the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

427
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,070
so when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing any kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

428
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,730
investigation where you're you're

429
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:56,270
tracking somebody on Twitter make sure

430
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:58,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you you know you if that name no</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">longer shows up in your feed for example</font>

432
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,230
then you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and do some</font>

433
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,899
queries based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that number and see if</font>

434
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:09,170
they've changed that name along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

435
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:13,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you know quite honestly some of</font>

00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:16,910
the drug<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealers and you know porn</font>

437
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,380
purveyors that we follow you know they

438
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,000
change their name quite often they

439
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,370
change their profile picture is quite

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,460
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they may do that two</font>

441
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:30,379
or three times a week and but we track

442
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:32,330
them using those numbers you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

443
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,160
on other social networks as well and

444
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:41,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll point it out as we get to them okay</font>

445
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:46,130
another useful tool within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

446
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:48,140
domain useful tools is it used to be

447
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter would not give you the</font>

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">history</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of somebody for example Twitter</font>

449
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,470
would only reveal about the last two or

450
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">three weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their tweets if you did</font>

452
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay or use the API to do any kind of</font>

453
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,340
queries on them they have sense in the

454
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:13,530
last month or so open<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up to where</font>

455
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can get a much much much much longer</font>

456
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:19,000
tweet history on somebody than what you

457
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:22,420
could before so you can almost go back a

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,590
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years there's also some other</font>

459
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,170
sites many other sites probably 30 or 40

460
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:35,790
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out there that I know of that</font>

461
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:35,790
will actually store<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet histories and</font>

462
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:47,889
there's a site called topsy.com<font color="#E5E5E5"> t.o.p sy</font>

463
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">bcom that will store tweet histories but</font>

464
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,350
it only stores the more important things

465
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:58,330
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about so for example if</font>

466
00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">they say I'm at our VA sec you know 2013</font>

467
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:05,399
in Richmond Virginia and here's a link

468
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:09,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to my slideshow well that link has</font>

469
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,870
significance to it so it'll actually

470
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:15,439
explode that

471
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:19,639
short URL turn it into a long URL and

472
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">then post it with their with their tweet</font>

473
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,430
so you can get a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of back information</font>

474
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:30,230
on somebody by taking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at them</font>

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,470
interested in GPS information like where

494
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,940
do those tweets originate from things

495

00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:23,690
many you follow that particular hashtag

514
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:40,009

515
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:43,639
a whole history<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those of those</font>

516
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:47,509
hashtags so for example one case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

517
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:57,008
worked on it happened to be an

518
00:27:47,509 --> 00:28:00,429
infidelity case the the guy's wife

519
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:03,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">suspected that he was having an affair</font>

520
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:06,979
because he started<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to conventions</font>

521
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:08,958
like this one that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'd go to</font>

522
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:11,719
like one used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to one convention a</font>

523
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:14,239
year now he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know five or</font>

524
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:16,279
six seven different conventions it

525
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:18,529
wasn't information security it was like

526
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:24,529
a lawn care or something so don't get

527
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:27,619
excited but anyways anyways we came up

528
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:30,200
with a pattern of he was there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

529
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:33,289
was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all of these conventions</font>

530
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,539
and that was pretty much how we honed in

531
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:38,029
on not only the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was having</font>

532
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:40,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">an affair but who he was having an</font>

533
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:41,809
affair<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and of course the next</font>

534
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,559
question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her telephone number</font>

535
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:48,840
and

536
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:54,240
at any rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok Facebook we all of</font>

537
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:56,840
facebook and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit</font>

538
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,820
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook has of course</font>

539
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,639
profile information lots of it or as

540
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:06,120
much as you give us it has location

541
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:09,899
information it has photos I believe now

542
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,658
that Facebook is actually stripping out

543
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:14,489
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> photos the GPS information does they</font>

544
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,820
may know that I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've</font>

545
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,409
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to do that it used to be</font>

546
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,869
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could download somebody like</font>

547
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:24,869

549
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:30,658
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> google map it based on the GPS</font>

550
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:32,100
information that was in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> photo but I</font>

551
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:36,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there now stripping that out</font>

links and then you have check-ins which

562
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,869
is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like GPS information so if</font>

563

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're within the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same city or same</font>

704
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:40,410
area but some meetup groups are actually

705
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:42,810
statewide some are even national people

706
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,359
can upload photos to meet up just like

707
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:48,299
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can to Facebook and Twitter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

708
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:51,710
LinkedIn and everywhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have</font>

709
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,710
to keep track it out yep

710
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:00,360
um we have one that we make available

711
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,810
but I can't Americo stand up here insult

712
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:06,050
to you yeah okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you join our</font>

713
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:09,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization you get it for free so</font>

714
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:11,220
plugged it okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can use it you</font>

715
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,260
know you can use whatever grep you want

716
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,810
but most groups don't read binary files

717
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,410
or sequel databases and things like that

718
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:21,870
so if you if you want to find all all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

719
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:24,600
them you know you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with</font>

720
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:31,850
some pretty creative software to do that

721
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this would have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry i</font>

722
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably only got about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15</font>

723
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes it's okay so here's another</font>

724
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:44,850
network foursquare people can check in

725
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:46,920
so now we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS locations again I</font>

726
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:48,779
mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we see now</font>

727
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,880
most of the investigations we do now

728
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,950
ladies and gentlemen are on mobile

729
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,720
devices I mean looking at people's

730
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:59,480
windows machines for artifacts of datas

731
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,419
you know two years gone at this point

732
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay these mobile apps will keep track</font>

733
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,260
of where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been even on the</font>

734
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:12,990
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> even on the phones and stones</font>

735
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:17,040
foursquare<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good example gowalla is</font>

736
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:19,740

00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">GPS indicator so it knows exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

740
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:30,540
