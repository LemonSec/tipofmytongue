110
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,820
up to email assuming you know you have

111
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,200
access to me from the outside they don't

112

need IT to come over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey</font>

personally but Apple anyway has made it

119
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,979
very very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to adopt and</font>

120

use BYOD inside the enterprise and this

121
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,860
is why the BYOD it makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just easy</font>

the thing out right and what it happened

172
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,130
is I guess so dependent on these

173
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,409
applications that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> could go and</font>

180
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,010
productivity for end-users and we have

181
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out kind of how to adopt it</font>

182
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,460
because if somebody said it's already

183
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,290
there so give me another reason where

184
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,060
are the other reasons why some of you

185
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,450
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at BYOD other than it's</font>

186
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,070
already there any other reasons or does

187
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,370
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> come back to it's already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

188
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,890
productivity is that somebody say

189
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,230
something no nobody said something speak

190
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,849
out guys seriously I'm fully awake this

191
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,560
morning i'm on west coast time you guys

192
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,600
should weigh more weight than me at this

193
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,930
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

194
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,560
reasons that BYOD and mobile is staying

195
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,270
at the enterprise IT teams are scared of

196
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,940
mobile and scared of BYOD it's something

197
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">new it's a challenge right and so these</font>

198
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,550
are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stats that were put together by</font>

199
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,979
some analyst firms to basically say why

200
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,690
enterprises are scared about mobile what

201
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,910
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> security threat says it does it</font>

202
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,219
pose what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find is very interesting is</font>

203
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee owned I don't if you can</font>

204
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,580
read this subtext there but the employee

205
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,130
on tablets is what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all the way to</font>

206
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,219
the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee own smartphones is</font>

207
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,860
what's next to the right yeah to your

208
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,940
right there those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two that</font>

209
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,350
people are most concerned about they're

210
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">not concerned about the company own</font>

211
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,900
devices which is which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting so</font>

212
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,600
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you why does the</font>

213
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:30,210
employee-owned devices pose more risk to

214
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,210
the enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course for you guys</font>

215
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,900
there any other

216
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,860
it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data you can't</font>

217
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,860
control the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay very good right</font>

218
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,670
can't enforce security policies okay and

219
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,170
so let me ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the security</font>

220
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:59,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">policies what kind of security policies</font>

would you normally want to enforce okay

222
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the unknown what are some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

223
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:11,810

224
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,350

237
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,319
is the one that interestingly enough

238
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,400
when I talk to people so unknown

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,530
securities<font color="#CCCCCC"> in data those are three</font>

240
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,750
wholeheartedly I agree with that's why I

241
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,550
got into this space mobile malware is

242
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,010
one that comes up a lot there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

243
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,569
some new article<font color="#E5E5E5"> mad props</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the pr</font>

244
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,110

247
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,450
same investors so I did tread lightly

248
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,819
I'm told um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh always some report</font>

249
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:14,120
that comes out like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

250
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,680
from last year but it shows this huge

251
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,570
spike and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just saw enough when the</font>

252
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,150
other day it said mobile malware has

253
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,220
increased three hundred percent 3,000%

254
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,280
quarter-over-quarter but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went and</font>

255
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">pulled up the report it was like</font>

256
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,329
hundreds of samples like hundreds of

257
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,460
variance of the same couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

258
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,820
mobile malware it wasn't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

259
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,260
thousands or millions of new samples

260
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,430
again here this is uh so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

261
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,350
report from lookout that talks about the

262
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,410
different types of malware so we have a

263
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:46,310
toll fraud we the green<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

264
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,949
malware and then we have spyware and the

265
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,130
toll fraud stuff is the biggest is the

266
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,560
big

267
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,730
thing there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it was just instantly</font>

268
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,709
other day and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

toll fraud is my favorite thing right

270
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,540
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in malware his toll fraud is a</font>

271
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,610
throwback to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet dial-up days</font>

272
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,110
when you would get some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of virus on</font>

273
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,510
your computer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would then change</font>

274
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,940
your dial up internet settings and would

275
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,810
route your your your dial it for your

276
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,840
internet connection you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you were</font>

calling your<font color="#E5E5E5"> local AOL or whomever and</font>

you're dialing you know some total

279
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,990
number and your upper middle east or

280
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,640
wherever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're getting charged like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">$18 a minute while you're on the</font>

282
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,590
internet and now we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with</font>

283
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,240
malware on mobile phones where they're

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it with SMS or changing SMS</font>

total numbers or the rerouting some of

287
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,340
your calls and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely love this</font>

288
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,199
because a throwback to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old days so</font>

289
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,300
it's my is probably my<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite thing</font>

290
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,670
that's going on right now but here's a

291
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,609
list of some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear</font>

292
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,439
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are risk for mobile</font>

293
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,540
there was a stat that came out said

294
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,940
fifty five percent of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> send work</font>

295
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,319
email and documents from their mobile

296
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,300
device through their personal email so

297
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,470
that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data control and</font>

298
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,839
do you know that people are doing that

299
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most people</font>

300
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,520
will use insecure Wi-Fi networks you

301
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,230
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am one of those I travel quite a</font>

302
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,670
bit so when i'm here at conferences

303
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,800
actually I'd never used the conference

304
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,449
now are close to be home is one of it my

305
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,430
hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the best place to attack me</font>

306
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a coffee drinker but if I was</font>

307
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,060
i'm sure i would use it at starbucks or

308
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">peets or whatever you know or if i was</font>

309
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,099
here at a campus working you know um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

310
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,690
think one of my my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on</font>

311
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this slide though is this survey from</font>

312
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,220
IBM<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know why but i love to pick</font>

313
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,020
on IBM for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have no real</font>

314
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,480
reason why but they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have the</font>

315
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,860
best data for me to pick and this

316
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,080
basically just says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their</font>

317
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,270
employees were just completely unaware

<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk right this which is</font>

319
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,370
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> when the the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

320
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,800
CIO or the CSO<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't recall which from</font>

321
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,770
IBM came out a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months back and said</font>

322
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,209
you know we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing BYOD we have</font>

323
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,040
our reasons and we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

324
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,070
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rare cases we do it we lock</font>

325
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,290
it down they<font color="#CCCCCC"> back off that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> statement</font>

326
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,850
quite a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and they're they're</font>

327
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,620
really broadening it out and because

328
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,570
they're trying to sell solutions to

329
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,899
their customers so they can't say that

330
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,029
it's a bad thing they're trying to sell

331
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,670
illusions so uh but but I think that's

332
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">all one how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we survey</font>

333
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,699
because this last<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers always</font>

334
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:10,439
surprised me how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps you have</font>

335
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:11,790
installed on your mobile phone apps that

336
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,649
didn't ship with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone just</font>

337
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:20,939
yell out some numbers just ballpark 2350

338
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:23,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh crap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay alright so the average here</font>

339
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:25,290
is a 41 this is the stats about maybe

340
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,389
six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> old or so but the average is</font>

341
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,949
41 when i sold this stat when my

342
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,449
marketing guy came and my marketing guy

343
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,829
brings me all these stats and things

344
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,059
like you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to use this got to talk</font>

345
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,829
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's important i'm like i</font>

346
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,660
know i don't want sort of stats out

347
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,040
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought this one was interesting</font>

348
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,809
somewhat and surveyed the office and the

349
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,579
office was somewhere around 30 on

350
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:46,679
average I've 858 I do my entire workflow

351
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:48,649
my entire life with like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 apps on my</font>

352
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,670
phone and I'm quite happy with that I

353
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently am missing out on some</font>

354
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,998
goodness somebody's got 50 I got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

355
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:56,339
a list of that I gotta I gotta

356
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,980
understand what I'm missing all right so

357
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:02,339
anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a list a bunch of the</font>

358
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,929
BYOD risk this is the stuff that we hear

359
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,790
people talk about your journalists say

360
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:10,800
this is what vendors were pitching evil

361
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:12,209
vendor all that does this resonate it's

362
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,199
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more comprehensive than what we</font>

363
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,410
talked about earlier with some people

364
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,910
say so let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you what about um you</font>

365
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,230
know rooted or jailbroken phones are

366
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,389
those is concerning your enterprise

367
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,059
would you allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rooted jailbroken</font>

368
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:27,179
phone to connect to corporate email or

369
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:30,269
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> propia see some nose your nose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

370
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:32,850
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a non you know company or</font>

371
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,829
organization approved<font color="#CCCCCC"> root and fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

372
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,110
going to call that anybody would allow

373
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:39,449
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say straight up rooted device any</font>

374
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,800
end user to connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see anybody say</font>

375
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:46,079
yes so give me some of the guys that

376
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no why not don't know what's in it</font>

377
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we're back to the uncertainty</font>

378
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,350
thing okay very interesting yeah the

379
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:54,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">NSA's research is quite interesting so</font>

380
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,059
we work with we work the NSA quite a bit

381
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:59,249
in CI and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's sampling some of the</font>

382
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,959
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do and some other stuff is</font>

383
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:02,519
quite interesting their approach to it

384
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,618
and it some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their stuff only ever</font>

385
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,119
works in the government in that type of

386
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,559
security environment it won't work for

387
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:09,389
the rest of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world but it's</font>

388
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite awesome i like it quite a bit so</font>

389
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,439
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so the jailbroken</font>

390
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,640
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> at permissions you know this is</font>

391
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,020
AB copying your corporate day

392
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,250
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing whatever it supposedly does</font>

393
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,840
cloud storage your enterprise lack of

394
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,030
enterprise control<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that one a</font>

395
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,590
little bit device patching is always an

396
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,850
interesting one we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

397
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,070
patching servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

398
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,340
patching<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know laptops and</font>

399
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,590
applications I'm just now starting to

400
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,560
see discussions around patching mobile

401
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,050
devices does anybody in here have a

402
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,339
policy on patching mobile devices or you

403
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,760
know thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about one trying to</font>

404
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,770
develop something around that space ok

405
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's see much there so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

406
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,360
interesting because full devices tend to

407
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,420
roll versions much quicker and on<font color="#CCCCCC"> us the</font>

408
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,340
adoption rate of a new version is

409
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,709
ridiculously fast I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> users want that</font>

410
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,860
new version and so old versions roll out

411
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,840
pretty quickly so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk window is</font>

412
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,850
kind of small so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a Alex were</font>

413
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,150
there with risk and it's read learn from

414
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:12,030
Alex and on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android on the other hand</font>

415
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,770
because there's so much fragmentation in

416
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,060
the market and you have some devices are

417
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,640
that are at the lower end of the

418
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,430
spectrum we see the doctor is still

419
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,780
quick but much much slower so device

420
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,520
patching is something that I'm actually

421
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,079
seeing more and more companies concerned

422
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,920
about but how do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

423
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,630
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are getting it fixed because</font>

424
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,130
we're starting to see attacks against

425
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,770
mobile devices I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that on</font>

426
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,990
there was a on Twitter last night if you

427
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:38,240
follow the normal folks there was some

428
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:41,790
discussion around a DHS FBI bulletin

429
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,440
about attacks against mobile devices

430
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,819
they're starting to see that and there

431
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,310
were some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that countered it</font>

432
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,900
like Charlie Miller<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's brilliant</font>

433
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,280
brilliant researcher said you know we're

434
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">not really seeing it I got a discussion</font>

435
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,640
with Charlie and said Charlie<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you</font>

436
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,770
know I said you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from the</font>

437
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,610
spook world Charlie's former NSA I feel

438
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you come from the scoop or do you know</font>

439
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,750
how this game goes there's stuff that we

440
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,510
don't see or we can't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that we</font>

441
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,160
do know about on the vendor side that's

442
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,379
happening and this is why you know you

443
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,910
get these early advanced things so there

444
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some attacks that are happening but</font>

445
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,850
when I serve it most companies most

446
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,440
companies are unaware of any direct

447
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,770
mobile attacks right now trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

448
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,480
attack the operating system remotely but

449
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,490
infinitely enough it's starting to

450
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,040
become a topic everybody kind of agree

451
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">with these risk</font>

452
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:30,170
any that you would disagree with know

453
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,699
any that you would add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

454
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that must be doing awesome today this is</font>

455
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">good oh that's all hand right here legal</font>

456
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,960
discovery yes yes I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> legal</font>

457
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,020
discovery on here yeah so legal

458
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,630
discovery the big one um I was in the UK

459
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,480
about six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago and I was at this</font>

460
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,310
event and I got cornered by like 20

461
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,430
people afterwards talking about

462
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,429
ediscovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forensics and and which</font>

463
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,290
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked forensics here proper like</font>

464
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,780
chain of custody you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has to go</font>

465
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,580
to court that kind of thing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EU is</font>

466
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,580
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big they're trying to find</font>

467
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">solutions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for litigation support and</font>

468
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,090
forensic analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll hold up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

469
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">court on mobile and they're having</font>

470
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,320
difficulties from what I'm understand

471
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,850
from a lot of the banks so I take us I

472
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,879
take a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different approach to</font>

473
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,790
to some of the my entire career been

474
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,010
much more progressive I say let's find

475
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,040
the progressive solutions let's find how

476
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:28,340
we can solve problems while moving

477
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,830
everybody forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's get the</font>

478
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,409
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the unknown risk then</font>

479
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:36,649
evaluate what we have to do and so this

480
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">is my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is slide that my</font>

481
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,640
co-founder uses all the time he calls

482
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,450
his guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Guido I'd love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to just meet this</font>

483
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,590
guy get him to come one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

484
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,360
presentations because he's been in so

485
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,949
many of them at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point call this guy</font>

486
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,629
Guido<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the concept here is that</font>

487
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,070
there's old school security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and new</font>

488
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,020
school security<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old school security</font>

489
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,939
was lock it all down deal with the user

490
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,139
problems afterwards right I'm guilty dad

491
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,600
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business a very long</font>

492
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,640
time I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> guilty of doing that the new</font>

493
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,100
school says let's think about the users

494
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about the workflow let's address</font>

495
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,649
those things up front the reason why

496
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is so relevant today is BYOD we as</font>

497
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,870
the enterprise as the employer we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

498
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,510
own the device now in mobile security in

499
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,129
general we might on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device but we're</font>

500
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,750
seeing a big trend of many companies

501
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,550
moving away from owning very many

502
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,050
devices they might own a couple they

503
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,120
might own some test devices they might

504
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,740
own a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you know some employees</font>

505
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,370
here therefore key executives or

506
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,470
whatever but BYOD by large is the mass

507
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:34,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">mix of the mass of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

508
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,640
deployments so how many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more</font>

509
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,740
be why

510
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,760
the devices in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization then</font>

511
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,690
enterprise own devices ok how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of</font>

512
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,640
the Alpha said way around how do you

513
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more company owned than buiding</font>

514
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,420
okay a few more hands all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now let</font>

515
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,939
me ask somebody just put up your hands

516
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,290
on now and shout out an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do</font>

517
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have more company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own devices than</font>

518
00:19:51,290 --> 00:20:02,000
BYOD devices legacy and do you see that

519
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:03,860
eroding and going away yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

520
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,590
that's exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from most</font>

521
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,600
people is that we did a big investment

522
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,040
we bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> beds or we bought good or we</font>

523
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,260
bought whatever we have these devices

524
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,540
and so people just have them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

525
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,830
they're breaking as<font color="#CCCCCC"> their and as new</font>

526
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,230
devices are coming out people are saying

527
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,610
well I want this new fancy device<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT</font>

528
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">says we can't afford the cost on that we</font>

529
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,540
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but go buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and find</font>

530
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">will we'll hook it up we're seeing that</font>

531
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,950
that creeping in most organizations it's

532
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,510
also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very East Coast West Coast thing</font>

533
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,540
will throw this back to Big E and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a</font>

534
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,129
little bit here on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> East Coast we</font>

535
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,889
actually still see businesses more

536
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,360
conservative around technology more<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

537
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,000
the company owns as a company runs this

538
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,459
on the west coast west coast on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the west</font>

539
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,770
coast we have um that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i throw</font>

540
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,950
gang signs and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how we do so</font>

541
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:51,290
how the west coast because<font color="#E5E5E5"> so overrun</font>

542
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,240
with technology companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> right not to</font>

543
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,680
say companies on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the East Coast don't</font>

544
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">adopt technology but because so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

545
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,260
companies are technology focused their

546
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:03,560
early adopters and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their liberal hippies</font>

547
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,540
on so they that's just my political rant

548
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the air about San Francisco and they</font>

549
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,860
they tend to say oh do do as you want

550
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,020
you'll bring in whatever device you want

551
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,570
very interesting trend that I that I

552
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,070
watch and I have to remember which coast

553
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,110
on what I'm talking to customers about

554
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,820
that because I go yeah everybody brings

555
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,429
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own advice and like no no we're</font>

556
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">in New York bank we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allow that</font>

557
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up Midwest but there's</font>

558
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,280
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> midwest bank as a customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm hugely</font>

559
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,959
progressive all about BYOD in the

560
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,430
banking industry and amazes me they're

561
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,120
very very new school what i call new

562
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,890
school all right so um we talk about

563
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,719
trust and YB why would you skip to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

564
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,970
right so there there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

565
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,320
as we enter this market that we have to

566
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,790
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get rid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

567
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,119
these legacy devices they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

568
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,709
die users going to buy new devices

569
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,269
they're not be supporting or whatever it

and take over IT whatever whatever it is

573
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,009
right and so what we understand is that

574
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,529
there's certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

575
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:01,779
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do for the company to be able</font>

00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,239
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust BYOD first and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

577
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,609
comes around<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the visibility side of</font>

578
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:08,469
things who is accessing what where are

579
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:10,359
they accessing it from where is data

584
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:20,079
common use cases that i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

585
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:22,299

593
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:38,199
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do everything on one device</font>

that to whatever system accounting or

600
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,769
purchasing tells me you know where i

have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to send it</font>

you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it via</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email or</font>

604
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,999
wherever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> store those kind of things</font>

605
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:59,589
all that kind of stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

606
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:01,989
the problem of doing those kind of

607
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:03,729
things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before I have all these</font>

608
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,779
little fancy apps but then when company

609
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:06,489
started restricting what I could do on

610
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:08,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">my phone then I couldn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

611
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:09,549
all came back down to exactly what we

612
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,549
talked about earlier is the lack of

613
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:14,979
insight even I as the CF so what

614
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:18,158
basically sat down and said what I allow

615
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:20,019
anybody else to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hell no I get to</font>

616
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,699
do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's my privilege as its</font>

617
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:23,739
you know my title and job which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

618
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:25,299
fair but that's why I allow myself to do

619
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,529
it bro in law anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

620
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't figure out where that data was</font>

621
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,499
going I couldn't figure out what apps

622
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,539
they had installed were those apps bad

623
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:33,339
were they not with a copy my data did it

624
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:36,039
go to China Russia where was it I don't

625
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:38,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and so this whole visibility is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

626
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,029
big problem that we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts the</font>

627
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:41,829
conversation would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a BYOD in the</font>

628
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:43,659
enterprise and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mobile in general</font>

629
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:45,039
right and then the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

630
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:48,429
thing that we see there though is user

631
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,769
acceptance right so for fortune 500 um

632
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:53,499
you know we we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have user</font>

633
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:55,449
acceptance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this how many of you get</font>

634
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:57,219
yelled at probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a weekly basis but</font>

635
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:59,200
some irate employee within your

636
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:02,590
organization for something that

637
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,419
your security did yes I heard more

638
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,799
laughs than hands going up nobody wants

639
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:07,570
to admit that right it's the dirty

640
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:09,490
secret we all know it back in the day

641
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,350
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember closing out a ticket in</font>

642
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk system and I put that it</font>

643
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:17,620
was a problem between the keyboard in

644
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,690
the chair little did I know the help

645
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,549

648
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,928
with HR over that one but the fact is

649
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,070
that we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the user into</font>

650
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,720
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm the first one that's</font>

651
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,149
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like user i don't care i'm gonna</font>

652
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,260
see so it's how it goes oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

653
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:40,600
learned my lesson somewhere along the

654
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,158
way probably that day I got yelled at so

655
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,158
bad for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that</font>

656
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad either but whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so we</font>

657
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,090
have the other problem here of though

658
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:50,649
what is a user need so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the big</font>

659
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,658
concerns that we hear from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

660
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:55,120
right it is their privacy their impact

661
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:57,039
productivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> that single user experience</font>

and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a second any</font>

675
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:36,250
is that just the performance of the

676
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:39,699
device or of the workflow or both what

677
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,620
security slowing people down ever that

678

doesn't happen secured I didn't have

679
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,840

682
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,620

683
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,929
around with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my staff yesterday</font>

684
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,879
while I was traveling and I just kind of

685
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:00,980
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm oops</font>

686
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,630
like give you guys government<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

687
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,220
they're good so we have this policy and

688
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,290
house called eat your own dog food and

689
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,630
so we make everybody in the company use

690
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,190
our product and people will randomly get

691
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,900
moved between different groups and

692
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,070
configurations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our product and so</font>

693
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just randomly grab somebody and</font>

694
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,490
throw them in a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration and</font>

695
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,280
let that force down to them see what

696
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,600
that impact is to see how the product

697
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,680
works but also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really get their</font>

698
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,510
feedback right because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

699
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">in going to a customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and saying hey</font>

700
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,930
yeah everything's right users going to

701
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,219
love this unless I can see what the pain

702
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,980
points are and I allow them to do this

703
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,360
to me as well to be fair so anyway I

704
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">just threw some restrictions on</font>

705

yesterday and holy<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap you think I'd</font>

713
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:57,290
number one concern that I that I here um

714
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,530
sometimes it's not articulated very well

715
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:02,960
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> inner but you basically say this is</font>

716
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:05,840
my device I have a two-year contract and

717
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,670
I got a deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> from AT&T for you know 399</font>

718
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,129
or 299 over the current prices for an

719
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,690
iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why are you installing</font>

720
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,150
something on it why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing</font>

721
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,170
something with it what can you do are

722
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,420
you an autumn are you going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

723
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,820
accidentally erase my device all this

724
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,170
kind of stuff and it's a long

725
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,939
conversation ends up having a half of

726
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,990
the users the larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

727
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,310
the less you have to have this

728
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,990
conversation because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just begging</font>

729
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,669
you don't care and you say eat it and

730
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,380
whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

731
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,490
the more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it deal</font>

732
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,530
with it because they can come and find

733
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,910
you they know where your desk is and so

734
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:38,090
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually talk about this</font>

735
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,070
that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find um and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so a we have</font>

736
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:43,000
to we have to remember that it is the

737
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:47,000
end user's device it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian cats</font>

738
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,740
had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> article published on information</font>

739
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,570
world either yesterday or the day before

740
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days tend to blur together for me</font>

741
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,840
when I'm traveling but within the last

742
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,179
week he's had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> article published that</font>

743
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,949
was great and it said why everybody has

744
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,600
failed to BYOD or like basically hey

745
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:03,080
guys this is why we've all screwed up

746
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,909
and his whole point you can boil the two

747
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,100
page article down to one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

748
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,900
it's not the enterprise's advice it's

749
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,760
the user's device respect and this is

750
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,470
where the privacy comes in the features

751
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,390
all that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

752
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,090
interesting side note I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> determined</font>

753
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,250
that the cost of user privacy is 39

754
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:22,370
dollars a month that's the cost of it I

755
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,919
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple customers that have all</font>

756
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,510
come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me for advice you know because</font>

757
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,299
we we work with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of companies that</font>

758
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">were in early pilot program and they and</font>

759
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:32,510
they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

760
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,280
was sitting in one of their offices

761
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,390
actually the the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> day I name the</font>

764
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,500
director mobility for the company and he

765
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,840
said yeah my users are pushing<font color="#CCCCCC"> back on</font>

766
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,669
on you know enroll in their devices and

767
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,199
I said wine said privacy and I said well

768
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:50,000
how you gonna get around found that if i

769
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,190
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their data plane every month</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

770
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,409
see concerns go away someone's I cost

771
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,390
you forty nine dollars price of privacy

772
00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:00,500
forty nine dollars a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anyway use</font>

773
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,270
that all right so uh speeding through a

774
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple days here a little bit but um</font>

775
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,809
here's here's where we have an

776
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,789
interesting disconnect right now trying

777
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,928
to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> those enterprise requirements</font>

778
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,260
and the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> user requirements</font>

779
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:13,820
enterprises want to want users use these

780
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,799
enterprise great apps right so

781
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharepoint interlink citrix watch docs</font>

782
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,820
these sort of things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> love watching us</font>

783
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,100
by the way um but employees want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

784
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,928
you send it box drop its<font color="#CCCCCC"> sugarsync</font>

785
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,309
pretty much any one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fifty</font>

786
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,350
thousand apps that are out in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> App</font>

787
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Store's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these days they want to be able</font>

788
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,969
to use it interesting story about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

789
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:35,480
send it a buddy montse<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO of a big</font>

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,220
credit agency and they use one of the

791
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,330
container solutions and he said the

792
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,460
containers aren't working I said why

793
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,439
what's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey and he said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well we have</font>

802
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,770
active users we've had in the last 30

803
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,600
days with you know email address at our

804
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:05,330
domain sales guy falling all over

805
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,370
himself right huge huge customer he'd

806
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,230
see how many users he thinks is a sales

807
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,879
opportunity doesn't realize talking to

808
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,640
the sea so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's got to shut this down</font>

809
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,190
feel bad for the sales guy so sales guy

810
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,820
goes yeah you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 400 different users</font>

811
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,980
use our service in the last 30 days 400

812
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,020
so I asked my cell how much did you pay

813
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,100
for that container solution said<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

814
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> half million</font>

815
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,750
enterprise-wide very large enterprise

816
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but 20 million and just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font>

817
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,350
kind of context so you can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

818
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,539
terms of your own enterprise so how much

819
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">did you pay her devices on per device</font>

820
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:39,590
license how much you pay her device he

821
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,940
goes well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it lists for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 a device we</font>

822
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,870
had a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume discount at eight I</font>

823
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,700
didn't that was a huge volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> just now</font>

824
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,270
but I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey that's great twenty</font>

825
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:53,240
percent awesome no that's that um so

826
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:56,299
eight dollars per device right across

827
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,640
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a two million plus and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font>

828
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:00,320
and his data was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> around it I asked</font>

829
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,960
my said why our users going around the

830
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,720
container his answer because it didn't

831
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,980
work for them I said so now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

832
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,659
sense of security because you have this

833
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,890
container but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that you have</font>

834
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:13,280
this risk because data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

835
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:15,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reality you had a false sense</font>

836
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,020
of security so by implementing this

837
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:21,110
container you actually created another

838
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,460
security problem he goes yeah 2.5

839
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,770
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollar security problem awesome</font>

840
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,270
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we have the big</font>

841
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,740
disconnect is that the way we see the

842
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,570
world and waiting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the world</font>

843
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,159
is often very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different and we have</font>

844
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to bridge that gap and</font>

845
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:36,679
close them in all right with all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

846
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,049
risk and all the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

847
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,669
in the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Audi and mobile</font>

848
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,679
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Chinese and our mobile</font>

849
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:46,760
devices and baseband exploits and all

850
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,110
this good stuff I was worth it what

851
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,140
would you all say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could if you</font>

852
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,879
could turn back the clock and assume

853
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,669
that v y ou D is not already in your

854
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,289
interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it would go forward with</font>

855
00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:06,590
adopting a solution yes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> no anybody</font>

856
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:08,059
yes couple how many know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay almost no</font>

857
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,760
nose<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so a lot of you guys aren't</font>

858
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:15,379
voting on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good just check my</font>

859
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,919
math skills today I would do it I would

860
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,840
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I've learned that it does</font>

861
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,030
create so much more productivity for

862
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,918
myself for end users I would do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

863
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,678
would do it with the proper visibility

864
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,000
the proper controls the proper data

865
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,409
tracking and handling right but i would

866
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,890
i would definitely go<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward and do</font>

867
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:36,290
that so let's talk about so we talked

868
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:39,590
about the we talked about the

869
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:42,409
the enabling it and the benefits of it

870
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,449
no more kinkos how many guys do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

871
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,890
like when you're traveling where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

872
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and you have to go find like a</font>

873
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,760
kinkos or fedex<font color="#E5E5E5"> store or something and</font>

874
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,500
actually print something out sign it

875
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,360
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to scan it how to email</font>

876
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,790
that back to your work email get back to

877
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,020
your hotel room<font color="#CCCCCC"> login your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop email</font>

878
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,879
that's somebody's and save to the file

879
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,740
share does anybody else have similar

880
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,120
problems to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you I'm just</font>

881
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,460
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure there's not a first-world</font>

882
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,010
problem or as one of my friends calls it

883
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,720
a champagne problem they're like poor

884
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,650
you you're traveling in Europe and you

885
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,870
have to go figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to print a</font>

886
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:18,830
document shut up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean friends I've</font>

887
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:20,780
made friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is kind of the</font>

888
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mobile security landscape how many</font>

889
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys reckon recognize these</font>

890
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,520
acronyms at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least one or two of them on</font>

891
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:28,340
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right i got the 20-minute</font>

892
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,990
mark excellent<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um this kind</font>

893
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,220
of what the mobile security landscape

894
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,750
looks like so we're gonna we're gonna go

895
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this a little bit about strategy</font>

896
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,090
and what's good and what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> and where you</font>

897
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,740
will run into problems so MDM we all

898
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,360
know nvm right is the MobileIron or

899
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,620
watch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zen browser or citrix now</font>

900
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,169
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are great at what they do</font>

901
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,669
right there asset management they're

902
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,970
like your land ask your mobile devices

903
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,860
they say yep you have 500<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhones and</font>

904
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,980
you know 3,000 androids or whatever

905
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,330
usually it's always more iphones um and

906
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,760
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you put a passcode on</font>

907
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,919
there I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let you inventory a</font>

908
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,860
it so you know what apps are on there or

909
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">what or what you know version it's</font>

910
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,790
running etc right a lot of security and

911
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,380
it's got past come to remote wipe I

912
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,440
don't generally consider the security

913
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,510
myself but I consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> just general</font>

914
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,280
configuration features but you know

915
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,510
nothing to protect the data nothing to

916
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,700
protect applications or control

917
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,350
application behavior in pure play nvm

918
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,418
right but they're good at what they do

919
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,860
they're good at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a bunch of</font>

920
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:26,600
devices I need to be able to manage

921
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,830
those I need to be able to wipe those I

922
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,270
need to understand what's in my

923
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,159
environment that's very very important

924
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,239
in my opinion right so that's kind of

925
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:39,980
convenient play this is i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> call v2</font>

926
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:41,629
on a maturity of mobile v1 was we just

927
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of give them to actually I sorry</font>

928
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:45,890
I'm gonna call this<font color="#CCCCCC"> V 2 and a half v1</font>

929
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,940
was we just we give people mobile

930
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,460
devices and we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really think about</font>

931
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,589
it kind of v2 or count

932
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,909
be one and a half was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow some</font>

933
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,619
view ID let's lock it down via

934
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:55,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">activesync or whatever and then we kind</font>

935
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:57,200
of get a proper strategy in two ND

936
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,339
ambient that's where we started actually

937
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,868
paying attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we had these</font>

938
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:01,339
vendors out there the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> week</font>

939
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:03,650
container so these are the goods of the

940
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:05,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">world right the company that keeps</font>

941
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,150
reinventing itself and will never<font color="#E5E5E5"> die</font>

942
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,500
because of litigation because they have

943
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,680
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> pee in their parent company</font>

944
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,570
they're awesome IP attorneys just by the

945
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,009
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you ever get sued by good be</font>

946
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,240
careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> their parent company is just</font>

947
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,500
awesome it's where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make</font>

948
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,299
all their money it's quite interesting

949
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read if you see who they're suing</font>

950
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,580
these days so the in theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great</font>

951
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,140
thing about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it's a</font>

952
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,520
container you have your work email you

953
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,770
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your work calendar it's all this</font>

954
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,509
low container I can't get out at can't

955
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,150
escape but as we saw with the yousendit

956
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,520
example it does escape also a black hat

957
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Europe there was just a talk I felt bad</font>

958
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,390
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the container guys it was just a</font>

959
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:44,000
talk that basically destroyed all the

960
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,640
containers and showed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey look they</font>

961
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,500
the great other<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go as</font>

962
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,609
far as to say their security theater one

963
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,800
of those researchers might have said

964
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:54,109
that I'm so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to say it but</font>

965
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,849
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they they pretty much said hey</font>

966
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">look there's a problem here it's a naive</font>

967
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:59,540
state so that was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting but</font>

968
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,279
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> great in theory and they will</font>

969
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,770
improve and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of said it forget</font>

970
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,599
it but it doesn't allow the user to

971
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,270
maintain their workflow the apps they

972
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,690
need it still causes some problems this

973
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:13,430
is where we saw a very small interest in

974
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,960
the market called ma'am mobile

975
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,669
application management there was three

976
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,150
four companies that played in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this space</font>

977
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:21,320
and their idea was that instead of

978
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">controlling device control the</font>

979
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,740
applications cuz that's ideally where

980
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,540
the data is and why do you care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

981
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,549
the actual device<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tend to kind of</font>

982
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,380
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this strategy i think the the</font>

983
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,200
strategy depends on your organization

984
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,790
and your risk profile but for many

985
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations this does actually make</font>

986
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense the problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ma'am</font>

987
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,040
market never matured nocona and wraps

988
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,180
fear got acquired before they went big

989
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,820
actually before they launched app

990
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,950
central got acquired by another company

991
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,680
because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> stalling the market</font>

992
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:54,770
this market actually never<font color="#CCCCCC"> matured kind</font>

993
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,440
of unfortunate our IP in this is quite

994
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,270
mature we're not a man player so it's

995
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting that this market never</font>

996
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:03,009
really really evolved

997
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,140
to the potential everybody thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

998
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:07,990
it would have but the idea was taste

999
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:10,390
take an app from from a vendor go to go

1000
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:13,328
to since they<font color="#E5E5E5"> use box we want to secure</font>

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:15,098
it hit their unsigned binary put it in

00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:17,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">your custom app store tell your users to</font>

1003
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:19,119
download that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one if you integrate them</font>

1004
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,400
your single sign-on and you know sam'l

1005
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and whatever's right and it would have</font>

1006
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,089
security control policies around it

1007
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,640
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wrapper around around the</font>

1008
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:30,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">code and so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

1009

business scale problem you problem it

1010
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:35,380
rang kind of a month but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1011
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:37,630
one of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyped things in and BYOD</font>

1012
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,059
for a very very long and then the last

1013
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,700
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have is a private ation this</font>

1014
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:44,200
goes to to the malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and malicious</font>

1015
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,328
apps which most people here didn't seem

1016
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,700
to really think was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem kudos to</font>

1017
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,740
you because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

1018
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,029
right now it eventually will be just

1019
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,950
like anything else we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1020
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">the trend we can see devices becoming</font>

1021
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,740
more and more open<font color="#E5E5E5"> right people are</font>

1022
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:59,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">pushing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more more control their</font>

1023
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,970
devices as that as that progresses we'll

1024
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:03,369
see more and more malware and malicious

1025
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,129
apps progress as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not there</font>

1026
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,079
yet this is years off at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

1027
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,839
though it though it is starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

1028
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,210
so that's our landscape right now right

1029
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,259
but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need and what we need to</font>

1030
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that we're doing no matter</font>

1031
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:18,309
what spooked when we go with and whether

1032
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,379
we're docked in BYOD or really mobile in

1033
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:22,359
general in my opinion is that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1034
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,119
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're applying our</font>

1035
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:27,249
controls and our believe disability is

1036
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,489
is the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to hear because this</font>

1037
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:31,450
is a space where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have no visibility</font>

1038
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:33,549
you know we have these vendor lock

1039
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,379
devices and we get no visibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1040
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:37,930
we need to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wherever data</font>

1041
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,910
is whether it's on the device crossing

1042
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,919
the network going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an appt out of an</font>

1043
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,930
app to a cloud service back and forth

1044
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,239
that we're able to track that we can

1045
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually understand what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a user is doing</font>

1046
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,190
who that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what device that is what</font>

1047
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:52,839
data the context of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data right now</font>

1048
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,239
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just corporate data because as</font>

1049
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,499
we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our failed dlp</font>

1050
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,430
implementations because you know there's

1051
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:59,769
a cup of you that did the same thing

1052
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,288
we're like dlp let's buy it let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1053
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:04,238
throw it at everything holy crap this is

1054
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:06,430
a flood of information let's back it

1055
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,039
down and restart right we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all did that</font>

1056
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:11,649
not all corporate data is equal right

1057
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,299
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jpeg is attached to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your email</font>

1058
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,460
signature you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

1059
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:16,660
securing but the word file that will

1060
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,180
attached there that had the new

1061
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,160
company's strategy or had your audit

1062
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:25,060
findings that you care about right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1063
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,250
so not all data is is equal so we need

1064
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,049
to apply a risk-based approach just like

1065
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,510
we do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other areas of our business</font>

1066
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,460
right now so understanding all of that

1067
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,800
across wherever the data is wherever the

1068
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,840
applications are ever the device is

1069
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,610
being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log on portal mat so that</font>

1070
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,790
we can understand it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then obviously</font>

1071
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,650
the the user empowerment empower the

1072
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,810
users<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to use the applications</font>

1073
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need that make them productive</font>

1074
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,920
and actually honestly make as easier

1075
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,240
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the let the more users can</font>

1076
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,670
do for themselves unless we ever have to

1077
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,830
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my goal I don't</font>

1078
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,720
want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this</font>

1079
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,880
is something I solved from pwc a while

1080
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,230
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just put in here and</font>

1081
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,600
basically just says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know from</font>

1082
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,130
mobile you need to have a an approach

1083
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,630
that works on any device across

1084
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,330
everything and it's great there was

1085
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,160
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> PwC quote that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

1086
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes because I thought it was</font>

1087
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,220
complete another<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullsh the first time I</font>

1088
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,689
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then it was probably out a</font>

1089
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,129
week later that I sat down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just</font>

1090
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened to see it pop up in an article</font>

1091
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,940
somewhere and I go actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

1092
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:23,529
true and it basically said that mobile

1093
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,060
and BYOD is one of the biggest

1094
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:30,100
fundamental shifts in enterprise IT that

1095
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,310
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in many years and they put it</font>

1096
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the way back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to personal computers</font>

1097
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,450
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I'm ready to say that quite</font>

1098
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,100
yet but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a huge huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shift with the</font>

1099
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,680
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring your own device bring your</font>

1100
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:44,710
own technology the consumerization of IT

1101
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,899
and corporate data makes this a very

1102
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,760
very interesting time an interesting

1103
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,830
space where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually have to start to</font>

1104
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,960
think differently because the game has

1105
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,700
really changed like we have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1106
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,100
different approach neck because we can't

1107
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,270
lock down a device that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> own up</font>

1108
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,500
and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out though how to</font>

1109
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,090
understand the unknown how to protect

1110
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,860
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how to apply our controls</font>

1111
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,420
I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys three all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three of</font>

1112
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,070
them said those because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that</font>

1113
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,410
rolls really well into my presentation

1114
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so we're coming up close to</font>

1115
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of time but I want to leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1116
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,760
time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some questions you guys are not</font>

1117
