57
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,800
our own views do not express the views

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,359
of I guess our company my company you

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,830
know we like to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma work i guess</font>

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,209
and we still may want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> on doing</font>

61
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for at least the next couple years</font>

62
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:53,900
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna try not to excuse me it</font>

63
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:55,280
fisma does pay the bills but we'll talk

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,870
a little bit about that as well does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,280
pay it as well as it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay the</font>

66
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">bills this is me CTO of senate</font>

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,660
international I do know more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma</font>

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,220
and cna than I tend to like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> omit you</font>

69
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,420
know if you've done this type of work

70
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure you got drawn into these</font>

71
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,069
conversations about what control does

72
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,160
this vulnerability map up to as a CM six

73
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,750
as a cm7 you know and I can't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

74
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,340
how many hours I've wasted arguing with

75
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,510
people about that in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind is really</font>

76
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">not important the important thing is</font>

77
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,359
that you discover a born bill you've

78
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,940
mapped it back to specific control but

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those you know</font>

80
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,870
if you want to give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a file on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,329
I appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I mainly tweet about the</font>

82
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:37,970
security issues and and online gambling

83
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:41,510
so then we have Andrew here<font color="#CCCCCC"> say Oh up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

84
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,650
his Andruw too so my backgrounds a

85
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,959
little bit different than Gus's i'm

86
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,940
actually a former software developer so

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,410
i'll be sort of giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview</font>

88
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,859
from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementers</font>

89
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,709
perspective on what it took to to

90
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,320
certify a federal application<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

91
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,140
shared infrastructure so um that's

92
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,840
that's a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it's it's a it's a</font>

93
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:06,500
lot more intricate than it sounds so

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,780
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so what so we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

95
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,600
basically certify a major application

96
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:15,290
over not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> shared infrastructure but</font>

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,108
actually having to deal with a mixed

98
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:22,789
codebase nested applications and so on

99
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,409
so it's my best advice and if you if

100
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,789
your if your encounter with something

101
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,400
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is just too</font>

102
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,490
just to have a lot of faith and don't be

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,450
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks and answer is</font>

104
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch into some of those</font>

105
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,539
concepts that he talked about during his

106
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,000
portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so why this talk no one's</font>

107
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,130
from a department<font color="#E5E5E5"> commerce here right</font>

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay good I'm not going you know this is</font>

109
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not going to be a Jack Daniels</font>

110
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,340
get up here and bash on pci or some

111
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,620
regulatory standard talk at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope</font>

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,000
not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do think and we'll talk</font>

113
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,220
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> phys most good points i think it</font>

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,590
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of good points there's</font>

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,870
some negative points as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and we'll</font>

116
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,190
touch on those but really you know this

117
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,720
third<font color="#CCCCCC"> bowl i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's important</font>

118
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,750
because even if you're not directly

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,370
dealing with bhisma right now you might

120
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,020
meet be down the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just give you</font>

132
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might be like Andrew down the road</font>

133
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,700
where your organization company

134
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,250
eventually ends up hosting a federal

135
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,510
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then has to comply with this</font>

142
00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:00,530
sometimes but I so<font color="#E5E5E5"> FISMA a brief history</font>

143
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,810
of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure most of you are aware of</font>

144
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:07,380
police heard of it and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA is but</font>

145
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,150
the core piece dates back to 2002 with

146
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the federal Information Security</font>

147
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,609
Management Act<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that really defined</font>

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,679
the state of<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA as we know it now of</font>

149
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">course before then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you had OMB circular</font>

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,690
a 139 teen 85 and was updated a couple

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">times which really started this whole</font>

152
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,760
mess and really started the term

153
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,810
certification accreditation and causing

154
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,240
government systems to have to go through

155
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through a year cycle and become</font>

156
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,290

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,179
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the term certification accreditation</font>

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,390
know of these 800 series of documents

167
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,479
which give you guidance in various areas

on how to implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma and a</font>

172
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,280
just real quick there's a difference

173
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,930
between Phipps and special publications

174
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,150
if you're not aware Phipps are of course

175

<font color="#E5E5E5">mandatory you have to follow those</font>

special publications 800 series our

177
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,290
guidance and we'll touch on a couple of

178
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,850
these 800 series documentation as they

179
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,770
relate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certification</font>

180
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,280

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you're not dealing with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">fisma this has some really good guidance</font>

183
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,310
on their site for example we recently

184
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,780
had to do an assessment on a random

185
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,750
number generator for one of our gaming

186
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,669
clients and this has you know as 800

187
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,130
series document that talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to</font>

188
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,870
go about assessing that even has a tool

189
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,210
suite that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use in order to do</font>

190
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,880
that so they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than just</font>

certification accreditation

all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> different standards and</font>

compliance regulations what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

203
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,490
about these really have you ever closely

204
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:28,120
looked from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> regulation to the other</font>

205

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,570
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference in my opinion you</font>

probably may not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sivas very well</font>

208
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,990
but was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crosswalk between pci and</font>

209
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:40,600
the 853 series in my opinion security is

210
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,940
security compliance as compliance a lot

211
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">of times you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see these all these</font>

212
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">different standards and it may differ</font>

213
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,790
slightly between the industry that

214
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're in but they all have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">station you know configuration</font>

218
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,000

224
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,180
test it properly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> document the</font>

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,399
of the the core nist special

228
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,599
publications out there and we'll touch

229
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,190
on just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these we're not</font>

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,510
going to talk on on all these you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

231
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,709
look at them at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your own leisure</font>

232
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,080
if you're not familiar with one but

233
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,760
these are basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building</font>

234
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,980
blocks of a certification accreditation

235
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,020
process when you get into the various

236
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,029
publications like 837 where you have a

237
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,439
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> management framework when 833 which</font>

238
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,649
tells you which security controls need

239
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,600
to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place so there's a lot of good</font>

240
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">information in this stock in these</font>

241
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,180
documents that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go through and</font>

242
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,550
learn what you need in order to

243
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,370
successfully implement a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma program</font>

244
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,620
in my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned 837 in the</font>

245
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,140
risk management framework process and

246
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:06,110
this is red one which was released in

247
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:08,529
two thousand or no<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 dot 2000-2010 and</font>

248
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,430
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fundamentally changed the</font>

249
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:13,970
process of certification accreditation

250
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,140
to what it was prior to rev one where

251
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,880
you have this risk management framework

252
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,829
if you look at it it's all sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

253
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,540
sense from a security perspective but i

254
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:23,239
guess it was you know pretty

255
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,670
revolutionary or they thought it was to

256
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,860
introduce it so now you have sort of a

257
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,649
different way to think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this</font>

258
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really the way that a mature security</font>

259
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:35,839
organization should be operating anyways

260
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:37,850
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocket science to us especially</font>

261
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">the part about the ongoing security</font>

262
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,440
monitoring which we'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

263
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:44,149
little bit but 837 is really the gospel

264
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,279
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bible but you want to follow when</font>

265
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process and of course</font>

266
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,570
in my opinion one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most critical</font>

267
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,310
components is 853 we all know this this

268
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,529
gives you the list of security controls

269
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,119
that need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> placed by family so you</font>

270
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,760
have your management operational and

271
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,709
technical controls and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

272
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,350
these compare them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI compared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

274
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,699

overlap I

276
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,419
even compared some of the gaming

277

standards that were released<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Nevada</font>

279
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:15,059
honestly fizz was doing a better job

than they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their</font>

285
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,730
dealing with continuous monitoring and

286
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:31,319
just like the other buzzwords that we

287
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,319
hear all the time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

288
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,819
conferences apt big data etc etc I think

289
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,160
continuous monitoring its other one of

290
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:39,959
these buzzwords that gets thrown around

291
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,480
and that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve all our</font>

292
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,729
problems now we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">three-year accreditation cycle we're</font>

294
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,839
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing continuous monitoring</font>

295
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:51,899
and really if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this in detail</font>

296
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,779
and how different organizations agencies

297
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,429
are attempting to implement a continuous

298
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,169
monitoring they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not getting</font>

00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:00,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">the complete picture of its really</font>

300
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:01,290
focusing on those easy components to

301
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,358
implement which are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

302
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,639
technical standards when we talk about s

00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:09,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">cap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see some of that as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:19,229
to DHS the other cyber scope but what I

307
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">find interesting is that now every</font>

00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,699
impact of course security they all have

311
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:31,169
some type of continuous monitoring slant

312
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:32,969
on their product because they realize

313
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:34,169
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sells in the federal government and</font>

314
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,269
that's what they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show how</font>

315
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:39,329
they can help you comply with continuous

316
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,709
monitoring but obviously I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

317
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,449
continuous monitoring is something that

318
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,888
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in place and should be in</font>

319
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:45,599
place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be doing but</font>

320
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to solve all our problems</font>

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,639
from a certification accreditation

322
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:53,999
standpoint so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully that was a quick</font>

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,529
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> brief overview of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma I think we</font>

all understand what bhisma is I don't

325
00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:02,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to give a you know our long talk on</font>

on the history of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bhisma but FISMA does</font>

327
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,680
have some good points and I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

328
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,350
come across as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit negative on</font>

329
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,508
compliance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA but I think there</font>

330
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,130
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us good</font>

331
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:14,230
points are we know like any compliance

332
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,810
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI etc it's better than</font>

333
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,519
nothing you know it forces organizations

334
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,589
that probably wouldn't implement

335
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:24,190
security to actually go ahead and

336
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:27,360
implement something you know a lot of

337
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,740
very smart people went into developing

338
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,660
this guidance and documentation if you

339
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,040
look at in this special publications you

340
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,630
look at all the authors and the

341
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,480
different organizations I contributed to

342
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,819
it I mean it runs the gambit from NSA to

343
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,019
defense to commercial I mean you have a

344
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,959
lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who provide</font>

345
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:47,319
feedback so you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot smarter</font>

346
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:49,569
people than than me so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I that</font>

347
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:52,209
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good thing of course raises</font>

348
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:54,399
the level of attention within your your

349
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,949
organization all sudden you know now

350
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,779
Andrew his company you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they care</font>

351
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,819
cared about security even<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they</font>

352
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,540
had to deal with bhisma but it helps

353
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:06,130
drive dollars it that way so it it helps

354
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">with funding it helps raises the</font>

355
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,880
attention and bar and visibility of

356
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:11,920
security with your organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

357
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">course as we saw on that one side of 853</font>

358
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,880
controls they do cover a wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> range of</font>

359
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,350
areas we can argue about perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> or some</font>

360
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that are missing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that should be</font>

361
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,750
there and other ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't is</font>

362
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:24,430
quite as important but it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

363
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,139
starting point and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course a</font>

364
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,540
lot of flexibility on how you go about

365
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:31,630
implementing it within your organization

366
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,849
so you know what Andrew does it for his

367
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,380
size organization and mission purpose

368
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,120
may not be suitable for someone else you

369
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">can help Taylor Bros controls and mold</font>

370
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,170
them into what fits for your

371
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,480
organization so it's not a hard and fast

372
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,939
rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this needs to be there you can</font>

373
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:50,319
somewhat manipulate those controls as

374
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:51,099
long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you know document which is</font>

375
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,689
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems all this</font>

376
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,100
documentation that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

377
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:55,930
bhisma but what is wrong with bhisma

378
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,480
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just a starting</font>

379
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:01,750
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you go just to comply</font>

380
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,269
with bhisma your you still can be

381
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,029
insecure we know that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we we</font>

382
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,670
see plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI companies have been</font>

383
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:12,189
certified that suffer credit breaches so

384
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,238
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that just a starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

385
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">organisations comply with FISMA for the</font>

386
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:18,410
wrong reasons going on with the first

387
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,910
bullet there just a check box and this

388
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point where it</font>

389
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,368
pays the bills because unfortunately in

390
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,499
my experience and we do do a lot of

391
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:29,089
bhisma cna work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

392
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:31,519
less of it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

393
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:34,819
exciting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a big</font>

394
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,100
future in it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a from a service</font>

395
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:39,799
provider standpoint it's become a

396
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,079
commodity organizations just want to

397
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:44,869
check boxes now because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> begun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

398
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,359
realize that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a joke in its</font>

399
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:50,239
current incarnation and that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

400
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,499
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep your scorecard green so if</font>

401
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:53,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can get someone knows how to check</font>

402
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:56,149
boxes and i's and cross tease I'd rather

403
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:57,529
pay them a lower amount of money when

404
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,769
someone that really knows security to

405
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,610
come in and do a holistic approach so

406
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,170
unfortunately some organizations are

407
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,049
complying with it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong reason</font>

408
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,238
these controls why they're well written

409
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:10,339
and documented they're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

410
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:11,480
confuse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> misinterpret I mean if I'm</font>

411
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how many people have looked at</font>

412
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,239
all the different control enhancements

413
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,980
that have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for like a</font>

414
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,689
moderate or high system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get into</font>

415
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,639
all the different sub bullets for a

416
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:21,709
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> control but it can be</font>

417
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,049
confusing and that's really why you need

418
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:27,079
some skilled personnel who understand it

419
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:29,059
to help implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> it correctly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

420
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,339
sometimes it does focus money attention

421
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:33,949
on them on the wrong security areas if

422
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,170
you have a vendor who's providing

423
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:38,569
certification accreditation services and

424
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,849
they you know focus on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

425
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:42,709
non-technical you know maybe management

426
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,959
control areas and you have a long list

427
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,479
of poem findings plans of actions and

428
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,008
milestones that you need to fix funding

429
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,170
make it diverted to those where you

430
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,759
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know gaping holes in your</font>

431
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,259
application like I'm a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

432
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,639
perspective that you now you don't have

433
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,339
funding to look at because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

434
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,839
close these poem items and it of course

435
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,480
has become somewhat of a paper drill I

436
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,380
don't think anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can can argue with</font>

437
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,669
that statement so we talked a little bit

438
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,020
about what the mistakes are but I want

439
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:12,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it what in my opinion</font>

440
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,970
what some of the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 mistakes are and</font>

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,610
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you who have implemented</font>

444
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,240
couple of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of the top</font>

445
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,039
mistakes are besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paperwork</font>

446
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,550
Joe any any things mistakes that you've

447
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,440
seen may

448
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,590
throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course of doing this type</font>

449
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,590
of work

450
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:39,220
perfect yep i actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have system</font>

451
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:44,049
categorization and there's a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

452
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,519
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants somebody else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll go</font>

453
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:47,649
through and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure you're thinking of</font>

454
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,620
some of the ones this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the ones</font>

455
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:52,418
I see all the time copying the control

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,508
requirements and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then restating them as</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you how many times I seen this it's just</font>

460
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:03,459
just don't understand so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I think everybody can pretty</font>

462

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,490
the information statement the compliance

<font color="#E5E5E5">mistakes I see and sometimes it's not</font>

478
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,189
you don't adequately describe it there's

479
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:41,470
no way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an independent third party to</font>

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,789
come and assess that control according

same time value to PL 24 system security

485
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,230
plan because your system secure plan is

486
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,909
not adequate on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right level so in my</font>

487
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,379
opinion this is something we see see a

488
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:04,269
lot and maybe it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes down to cost when</font>

489
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:06,070
we get to this budget issue as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

490
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,440
companies looking and government looking

491
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,360
to spend less and less money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this you</font>

492
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,249
know if it's vista system still gets

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,959
passed to cares of it has a you know

494

incorrect you know its compliance

495
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,789
statement you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they should but in my</font>

496
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,850
experience you know we see several like

497
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:25,059
this mistake number two inheriting

498
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,860
controls that you really can't or having

499
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,720
you know controls listed as common when

500
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,369
they are really hybrid and just real

501
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,799
quick not to bore everybody because you

502
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">know people discuss common</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

503
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,730
inherited you know and get confused and

504
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:38,409
argue about what's the difference but

505
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you know in a concept of</font>

506
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:43,419
certification accreditation you can

507
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:45,220
inherit controls from a from another

508
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,230
system so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a major application I</font>

509
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,090
sit on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a GSS I really shouldn't be</font>

510
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,070
caring about the

training or physical security i inherit

513
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,190
goes from another system but what you

514
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">see sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is UC systems like this</font>

515
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:03,179
we're here SI<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten dealing with data</font>

516
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:05,370
information validation and data input

517
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,049
and they're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a major</font>

518
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,820
application that is inheriting this

519
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,889
control there's no way inheritance going

520
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,960
to this is a web application<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

521
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,659
know you're entering in information into

522
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,520
it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people try to inherit</font>

523
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:19,740
controls where they really shouldn't or

524
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,970
say controls are common just so they

525
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,980
don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss the implementation</font>

526
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,020
status which of course when it comes to

527
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,240
security you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not doing your</font>

528
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,679
your system justice so that's another

529
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,929
common mistake that we do see incorrect

530
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,120
security categorizations everybody

531
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:37,710
thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system is a high because</font>

532
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,658
they think there's at least initially oh

533
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,700
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems yeah it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

534
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm important it's a high but<font color="#E5E5E5"> until they</font>

535
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,929
realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much time and money they</font>

536
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,610
need to invest in actually implementing

537
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,010
all the controls of a high-security

538
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,928
category system versus a moderate and

539
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,419
it's a big difference and of course

540
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,549
sometimes you have opposite of you know

541
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,010
so what I have PII and credit card

542
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,929
information but you know I'm a low only

543
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know 10 people my organization use</font>

544
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,770
it or something like that and but if you

545
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,360
do your data categorization correctly

546
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,760
using phipps one and nine and eight

547
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,320
hundred sixty it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear where your</font>

548
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,629
system should fall and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

549
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,100
tailor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that based on need but you know</font>

550
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,720
you should least be following that

551
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,850
initially and that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

552
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,610
mistakes that we very often see and we

553
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,020
counsel our clients you know to wreak a

554
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,789
tiger eyes your system we don't think it

555
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a high you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

556
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:28,529
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes you know they don't</font>

557
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,649
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make changes incorrect system</font>

558
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:33,690
boundaries is another and you know you

559
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:36,178
really sort of like PCI you know PCI's

560
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,070
got a habit of we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scope only</font>

561
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,110
those systems that deal with the credit

562
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">card transactions into the PCI boundary</font>

563
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,168
to make it as small as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible so you</font>

564
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to waste as much time and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">money investing on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pc i it's</font>

566
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:51,000
somewhat the same theory with with

567
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,879
bhisma<font color="#CCCCCC"> and where I really see this</font>

568
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,190
problem is typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in government</font>

569
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,470
organizations that host their own system

570
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,510
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do because they end up</font>

571
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,530
lumping GSS components in with their

572
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,300
major application

573
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,100
it really should be separate but at

574
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,280
commercial organizations like Andrews

575
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,480
where they have to host a

576
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,820
government-owned system it's on their

577
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,380
network how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you draw that boundary so</font>

578
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,490
you isolated from the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

579
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,230
corporate network from there are other

580
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,930
clients that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma</font>

581
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,700
compliance you know it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

582
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,960
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe that accurately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

583
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,190
system security planning also

584
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">technically you have to have isolation</font>

585
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,120
so you don't have to worry about testing

586
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:36,120
other components that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to</font>

587
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">or need to the fifth mistake not keeping</font>

588
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,929
up to date with the documentation and

589
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,429
and you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update this on</font>

590
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,200
they say an annual basis it really

591
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,850
should be more often<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that because</font>

592
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,830
what if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you run into the</font>

593
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,100
problem like I've seen we go through to

594
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,080
do a recertification of a system and

595
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,639
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> save a contingency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan</font>

596
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,649
testing portion and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

597
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tabletop test and we're like and</font>

598
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,610
they're like well we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have</font>

599
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative processing society</font>

600
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,120
anymore we move to another one well why

601
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,320
isn't your documentation updated not

602
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,639
just one example but if you're not

603
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,649
updating your documentation on a regular

604
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,320
basis it's gonna cause problems down the

605
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:13,980
road and unfortunately everyone does not

606
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">like documentation we know that time is</font>

607
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,310
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> six mistake waiting too long</font>

608
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process this is both in</font>

609
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,879
from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization waiting</font>

610
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,340
then you know they know their system ato

611
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,560
expires in six months but they wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

612
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">month until it expires it's like oh gosh</font>

613
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need to get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system recertified you</font>

614
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,110
know obviously corners are gonna be cut

615
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,980
mistakes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be made and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

616
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,689
also applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the integrators who are</font>

617
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,790
designing systems are going to have to

618
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,440
beef is more compliant not integrating

619
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,200
those security controls those<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA</font>

620
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,640
controls early in SD LLC process so they

621
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,720
get implemented correctly from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a start</font>

622
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,430
so it's at both places the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventh</font>

623
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,830
mistake not having<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough skilled</font>

624
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,080
personnel this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for doing the you know</font>

625
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,610
the initiation phase of a documentation

626
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,460
developing your system security planned

627
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,649
initial risk assessment CP etc and also

628
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are doing the assessments</font>

629
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,370
which I think directly relates to the

630
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,429
fact that certification accreditation

631
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,489
has become a commodity you know if if

632
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,059
it's so competitive to win contracts now

633
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,529
organizations are going to

634
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,600
cut their prices and to cut their prices

635
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,940
they can't have some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Oh SCP</font>

636
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,620
coming in to do the testing portion of

637
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,330
the penetration test you know they're

638
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna have some somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrist running</font>

639
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,389
Nessus you know against a web

640
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,850
application and say hey I did my

641
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:31,289
penetration testing so it goes both ways

642
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the side of developing the</font>

643
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:35,249
documentation and also doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the testing</font>

644
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,970
you know you need to have both if it's

645
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:41,129
done correctly the eighth making the

646
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:46,200
mistake that just because you have an

647
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:47,158
atl your system is secure this you know

648
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,049
don't you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say anything more</font>

649
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,720
about this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't tell you how many</font>

650
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:53,580
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard it you know when we're</font>

651
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,049
trying to maybe sell additional services

652
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,519
or provide some additional function

653
00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:00,059
they're like oh well my system<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

654
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:02,159
secure it has an ATO you know I'm pci

655
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,668
certified I'm secure we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font>

656
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,200
that type of testing you know usually

657
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,700
the security folks that you deal with

658
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,110
understand that this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case but</font>

659
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,619
unfortunately management still need to

660
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:16,199
be educated another buzzword with cloud

661
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,119
computing you know moving to the cloud

662
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,799
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all our problems you know</font>

663
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,049
it's gonna solve everything from you

664
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,658
know every security issue to your cna

665
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,519
issues to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your performance issues and I</font>

666
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big myth and you know</font>

667
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,360
with FedRAMP is trying to solve some of

668
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,899
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and yes you can move your</font>

669
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,008
applications to the cloud you're still

670
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,809
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have certain components that</font>

671
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:39,299
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for even if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font>

672

a to a system that is FedRAMP certified

673
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:44,309
and we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get more more CSPs</font>

674
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:48,059
that are federally certified<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw</font>

675
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,590
amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> just got theirs so we're moving</font>

676
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that right direction it is helpful</font>

677
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,830
that you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do as much work</font>

678
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,179
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to have to</font>

679
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,320
ensure about your piece that you're

680
00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:00,960
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there and of course</font>

681
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake similar to paperwork</font>

682
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,799
drill is treating the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cna process you</font>

683
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,909
know such as building a Potemkin village

684
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,710
and for those of you have heard the term

685
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:13,259
Potemkin village it dates back to the

686
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,480
late 1700s with Catherine the Great and

687
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Russia and she was doing a visit and her</font>

688
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,710
prime minister Potemkin you know just

689
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,320
built you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a facade of</font>

690
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,820
walls along the river so when she

691
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,039
cruised on their boat there it looked

692
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a very prosperous you know village</font>

693
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,720
when really it was just you know

694
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,580
a bunch of walls and I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

695
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,140
similar process you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes place</font>

696
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,790
and certification accreditation you just

697
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,260
have people building these nice fancy

698
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,990
system security plans and doing the

699
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,640
testing but where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meat to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

700
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">are they really complying with security</font>

701
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,840
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases you know they're not</font>

702
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,060
and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn it over to Andrew</font>

703
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,939
right now so he can talk about give some

704
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,580
examples from his organization on how

705
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,560
they went about and implemented security

706
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,649
he'll touch on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things from SCLC</font>

707
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:06,600
process and some lessons learned from

708
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:08,520
from his experience all right I'm hoping

709
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,469
this interesting for you so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it</font>

710
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,330
give you know to use some something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

711
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,690
take away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and without boring</font>

712
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:18,300
on governance um so um I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

713
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,830

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,640
but whether you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know what your</font>

722
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,810
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really not that bad I mean I know</font>

723
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:45,390
it's having in my case having two

724
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:48,780
segments out a legacy application that's

725

you know that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh I mean every</font>

729
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,790
growth of the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start small</font>

730
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:02,390
you you scale up one of the things to

731
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:05,040
not be shocked about when you start the

732
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:08,250
your cna<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and we're running SSP</font>

733
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:11,490
as is don't actually seriously don't

734
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:16,140
freak out you don't need so for instance

735
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:19,140
um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to to buy you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

738
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know break the bank it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

739
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,310
it's it's really running a business it's

740
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">running a little miniature business it's</font>

741
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,110
you have to stay profitable you scale

742
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,090
here your controls correctly but don't

743
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,770
omit it entirely so don't skip you know

744
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,020
static static application testing

745
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,580
entirely do it but then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know both</font>

746
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,389
start with open source tools or you know

747
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font>

748
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:51,240
don't skip entirely scale it correctly

749
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:54,390
so with that I'll start with some some

750
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,090
examples of how we how you can actually

751
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,610
really comply so some of these are

752
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my scenario so feel free</font>

753
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:04,169
to to stop and ask questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime</font>

754
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,510
there's actually a lot of stuff for for

755
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:09,810
my slides are kind of dense so each one

756
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these are it can go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a little</font>

757
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of sprawl so I'll just start the top</font>

758
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:19,380
so first first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you have a</font>

759
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,450
parent agency to start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

760
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,830
inheriting from to that will they might

761
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,250
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you bass lines as a</font>

762
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:30,570
start usually um oh I hate is that

763
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:32,220
usually but it's typically if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

764
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,139
inheriting controls from parent agency

765
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,670
they're going to be way off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bat</font>

766
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,310
there's just it's just going to be some

767
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">um it's a good place to start I wouldn't</font>

768
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just do that and be done with it um I</font>

769
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,390
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want also stress that you know you</font>

770
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,990
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be realistic about this again</font>

771
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:51,240
it's it is like running a business you

772
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,800
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go overboard and you want</font>

773
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,530
to stay compliant you don't want to just

774
00:29:52,800 --> 00:30:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">be compliant you want to manage risk</font>

775
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:02,940
which turns to a lot of dollars the next

776
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:06,060
thing is of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course contrast um if you</font>

777
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,490
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any if you're if you have a written</font>

778
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,370
contract that that's your meeting for

779
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,290
for water services you're offering your

780
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,939
lips what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I not impact level might be</font>

781
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,700
predetermined so that makes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

782
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,650
either for you hopefully it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

783
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,880
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> high but if it is high then you're</font>

784
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,290
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something to fall back on</font>

785
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,030
but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was contract written</font>

786
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,690
then it's tied to federal dollars and

787
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:29,610
you really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a choice you might</font>

788
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,140
have written in SL lays you might have

789
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,260
to comply with HIPAA you might have

790
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,850
incentives to go hl7 not sure if

791
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:41,940
anyone's here and having to work with

792
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:44,250
that next one is so it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a</font>

793
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:49,590
periodic internal security certification

794
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:53,970
program what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by that is so you</font>

795
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:55,530
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistically you want a way to</font>

796
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,950
built-in Jack security throughout the

797
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,080
ordinance

798
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:03,299
asian you don't want so you're not just

799
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,330
you know security<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't some you know</font>

800
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:08,940
some add-on service that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kasal</font>

801
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:12,178
periodically when something needs to

802
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,440
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's safe for production it's</font>

803
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's that should be at the</font>

804
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,889
organizational level which so this ties

805
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:23,279
to hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would a sound</font>

806
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:25,620
organizational security program that is

807
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,580
adopted and accepted by all the

808
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,260
directors and and implemented throughout

809
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:36,960
the organization as a whole and not just

810
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:39,779
for IT or r instance so the internal

811
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,940
security cert there's a there's a couple

812
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:44,399
ways to do that so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fame ones</font>

813
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,279
technical or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know so what do you</font>

814
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,989
basically do is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can you can</font>

815
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,179
write some scripts have it automatically

816
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,850
discover and audit your your system

817
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:56,279
engineers that way or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can</font>

818
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:58,620
say for instance write it into your

819
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,139
deployment program that's you'll have

820
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,239
soon you know establish a create a

821
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:06,600
quarterly reassessment program that you

822
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,559
must rerun these you know said you know

823
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:15,980
we run a set of set scripts or something

824
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:15,980
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> so next one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PHP iph I assessments</font>

825
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:23,940
data usage agreements<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have you</font>

826
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:28,080
might interact with other agencies so

827
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,510
there's in my case we do do so you'll

828
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,120
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want to look into any</font>

829
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:35,510
kind of information usage agreements<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

830
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,739
might have with them and then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

831
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:42,720
deliverables you might have to meet with

832
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:45,539
those also so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so</font>

833
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,250
so separating a level is why but the

834
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:50,340
partitioning or system this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font>

835
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:54,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you are a software developer</font>

836
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:57,870
around if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone tears if you so system</font>

837
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:59,760
separation is is um is it's critical

838
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,439
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that really has to</font>

839
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,559
start from the bottom up going

840
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,000
afterwards is it's not easy it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

841
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">just separating the majorette it's not</font>

842
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,280
just a bleep sub<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing the application</font>

843
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,760
the code

844
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,830
the servers it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's really best</font>

845
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,680
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground up from from</font>

the network infrastructure servers the

within the application and into the data

850
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,610

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">with virtualization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's yeah I've seen</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's pretty easy for from a cost</font>

853
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:36,149
perspective to say let's buy one you

it all on there that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and so</font>

856
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,439
next a review<font color="#E5E5E5"> of externally thought</font>

857
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:50,730
authenticated resources so periodically

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh you know I don't know if we talk</font>

859
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,070
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> more just and there's there's some</font>

860
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,780
things that could some really

861
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,659
interesting things that I probably can't

862
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:00,330
share if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have threats</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> threats</font>

863
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:04,020
periodically you might want to

864
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">periodically you might want to seriously</font>

865
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,659
just identify the types of externally

866
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,370
authenticated content you have exposed

867
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,679
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perimeter so just anything</font>

868
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:17,040
basically an inventory of any place that

869
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,530
are basically in the tat enough

870
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,320
indicated attack surface I mean this

871
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:27,149
sounds like common sense but it's not

872
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,919
really it's not really done often<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

873
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">you type resource permitting and for</font>

874
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:35,279
whatever other reasons um corporate

875
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:37,530
security policy is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> important it's I</font>

876
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,899
mean everyone has a hopefully you have a

877
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,030
corporate security policy but it's

878
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:47,179
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fallback mechanism for</font>

879
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:51,570

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:56,668

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually it's the result of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font>

888
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:21,180
continuous work of tenuous improvement

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,780
it's a lot of there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> documented thurs</font>

890
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,190
and this

891
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,360
I line special publication for

892
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:28,740
everything it is you know and and not

893
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,050
only is there a document for everything

894
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,120
but there's versions of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything so it's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of collective</font>

00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have too often you know there's</font>

902
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,580
there's uh there's there's legacy or

903
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,620
there's there's fire walls with with

904
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,930
rules with comments that you know that

905
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,480
the roles that no one has has any idea

906
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:19,080
what you know what it does so I as a

907
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:22,590
starting point um i would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh we</font>

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">i wrote a custom application that that</font>

909
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,890
basically creates an approval process

910
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,980
within the organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ties into</font>

911
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:31,140
it basically creates it in tracks<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

912
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,150
creates work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their it tracks work</font>

913
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,240
for the organization but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's based off</font>

914
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,580
of its<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's based off of anorexic risk</font>

915
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,609
acceptance process that ties to inform

916
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,890
directors automatically and additional

917
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,200
that it's we've incorporated a scoring

918
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:50,190
system internally so that ties into a

919
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,259
vulnerability a ranking system so it's

920
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,670
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something similar to that</font>

921
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,770
but definitely have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some place to</font>

922
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,830
identify and track those risks so that

923
00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,120
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just lost somewhere and</font>

924
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:05,340
those firewall rules aren't just sitting

925
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:06,810
there aging<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

926
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,590
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep going because uh</font>

927
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,590
anyway

928
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,500
so I'm gonna run through this probably

929
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,920
faster than intended so budgeting

930
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,390
definitely have an allocated<font color="#CCCCCC"> sound</font>

931
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">budgeting as course that's critical for</font>

932
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:29,210
for for any federal system it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

933
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:32,640
a given have an incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> response team</font>

934
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:34,410
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one so have a prototyping lab</font>

935
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not one that you might think</font>

936
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:39,930
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in a course you know so</font>

937
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,210
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i go i would</font>

938
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:46,109
recommend having a prototyping lab for

939
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:48,450
authorizing technologies because you

940
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:52,650
mean so so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the deficiencies many</font>

941
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:54,299
vulnerabilities so many think too many

942
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">times when running baselines and</font>

943
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:00,390
procedures um you know it's really you

944
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,040
know you need a place to test that

945
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,080
theory I'm not much of a theoretical

946
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,120
person you really need a place to

947
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,640
validate something before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it</font>

948
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,339
in one of the main differences between

949
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,650
my history at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer is that I've</font>

950
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,470
gone from from writing code being a code

951
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,720
monkey to a lot of writing procedures

952
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,970
and documentation but it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

953
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:27,029
it's it's there it's there for a purpose

954
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:29,310
it served 24 for others to use PMO

955
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,980
integration basically sdlc integration

956

going external risk acceptance process

958
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,200
yeah basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> where that's basically</font>

959
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:43,100
establishing you want to be able to

963
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:55,950
waiting acid ranking designation what's

964
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:59,700
cool about that is once you have that in

965
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:02,580
place you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually do what I did</font>

00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually I've automated it I've actually</font>

967
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,500
have traceability to specific to all of

00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,450

00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar so once you have some</font>

975
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,230
standardized you have to have some kind

976
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">of baseline to start otherwise you can't</font>

977
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,090
say something changed

978
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,320
and like because I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep on going</font>

979
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,450
forever on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it goes into</font>

980
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,710
configuration management so again

981
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:34,759
finally building in the architecture is

982
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:39,050
owning the architecture is critical well

983
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:43,550
I should probably really pick it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

984
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:47,870
I'm see let me any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I can</font>

985
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:49,130
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later so defend the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Enver</font>

986
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:52,910
sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned this a little bit</font>

987
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,140
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so I'm going over the the</font>

988
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,870
major categories so start with

989
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:59,450
management's at the highest level you do

990
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:02,720
want you have to have an information

991
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,890
security program to start dedicated

992
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,089
budgeting where that vulnerability

993
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:09,500
scanning schedule so when you're

994
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:12,740
specifying your vulnerability scanning

995
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,180
be realistic about it is so if you're if

996
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,959
you're certifying a major application<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

997
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:20,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">an application like us don't just don't</font>

998
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,510
you don't just include the server

999
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,129
infrastructure definitely going to the

1000

1002
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:36,830
another dimension that Scott commonly

1003
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:38,919
missed I'm see you know I'll go into the

1004
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:42,080
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to just cut it down to</font>

1006
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:49,670
so operational examples baselining

1007
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:52,880
disaster recovery is big one these are

1008
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">all really large items so you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually real example when how to work</font>

1013
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:10,340
on a case where a manager left a laptop

1014
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,730
on a cab in New York had some you know

1015
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:16,600
critical sensitive information on it the

1016
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:19,400
cost is astronomical when that happens

1017
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,759
yeah the potential loss is astronomical

1018
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,650
so a solution if you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> had this</font>

1019
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,900

or I can give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice on that right</font>

1044

documentation sucks i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is yes</font>

1047
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:04,339
whatever but if it if it's not

00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:14,359
additionally it creates uncategorised

right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gus thanks to android definitely</font>

1058
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,549
sis Andrews very good talk on 101

1059
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,920
afterwards if he has some specific

1060
00:43:31,549 --> 00:43:35,538
advice on what he's doing he ran through

1061
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,130
that very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly because he had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1062
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:38,960
first time we gave him this together so

1063
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,760
it's a timing may be a little bit off

1064
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,960
real quick I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys out here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

big line Jay told me that

1068
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:50,819
um how do these controls get assessed of

00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,650
course your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bibles</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 853 a which basically</font>

tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how to about go go about doing</font>

1071
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,769
it as a lot of interviews allow

1072
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:57,599
examinations you see that last bullet

1073
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:59,669
testing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of course is the</font>

1074
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,829
most important but of course is I think

1075
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a phase that suffers most currently</font>

1076
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:06,329
in the climate day or how you actually

1077
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:08,519
go about testing it some tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

actually perform 833 compliance and

1079
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:11,578
these aren't actually tools that we use

1080
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:14,578
for testing but these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more GRC</font>

00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:18,150
related tools that organizations are

00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:21,029
using and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the major</font>

1083
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,369
ones supposed to automate workflow if

1084
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:25,739
you've used any of these you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very painful it takes all it takes a lot</font>

1086
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:29,819
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it there's still a lot of</font>

writing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still have to do but</font>

1088
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:33,839
these are the major players out there

1089
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,519
that that we've experienced and that

1090
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,400
different government organizations use

1091
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,868
as far as tools s<font color="#E5E5E5"> cap you know when it</font>

1092
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes to an assessment perspective and</font>

1093
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:44,430
typical scanning you know you need to

1094
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:46,410
have a tool that is s<font color="#E5E5E5"> cap compliant you</font>

1095
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:49,259
know which is a protocol has a lot of

<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> components CVE cpe oval etc</font>

1097
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:54,569
etc but good news is most all your tools

1098
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:56,069
are already s cap compliant because just

1099
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:57,719
like continuous monitoring you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

1100
00:44:56,069 --> 00:45:00,569
government vendors realize they have to

1101
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:04,499
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if they want to sell so all</font>

1102
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:05,999
their tools meet this protocol from how

1103
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go about assessing management and</font>

1104
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:10,229
really a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the management process</font>

1105
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,910
is a lot of interviews and examinations

1106
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:13,649
and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we typically develop a</font>

1107
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,660
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IE spreadsheet where we</font>

1108

have a control who we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to</font>

1109
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:22,739
evidence required you know real fun

1110
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:24,690
stuff often assessing these are easy and

1111
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward but you really have to</font>

1112
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,589
read the control implementation

1113
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,180
statement carefully because sometimes

1114
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:31,229
they have some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good writers and</font>

1115
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,269
they'll try to make it sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

1116
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,769
really implemented when it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1117
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:36,328
like if you read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one closely later</font>

1118
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:37,499
you'll see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's does not really</font>

00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:40,469
meet the requirements of continuous

1120
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:42,959
monitoring operational one of the

00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">largest control classes but summit</font>

1122
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:47,578
definitely deal with directly impact the

1123
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:49,289
security of an organization i'm thinking

1124
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">about configuration management and</font>

1125
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:52,589
system integrity controls during a lot

1126
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,630
of your technical scans a lot of

1127
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:56,549
findings you can easily map back to

1128
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">either like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cm6 for configuration</font>

settings or si tu for flawed remediation

1130
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,259
so there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of non-technical</font>

1131
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,090
findings and operational but you'll come

1132
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,890
from from your interview examination

services listening technical so

1145
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,330
technical controls are typically what we

00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,110
find where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most fun</font>

County of interviews and examinations

1154
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,410
you still have to do i'm not sure if you

1155

ever looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> AC to for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

bullets each that have to be met it

1160

1166
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">do your web testing and find</font>

1167
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,520
vulnerabilities like sequel<font color="#E5E5E5"> injection</font>

1168
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,080
yes so what just a sequel injection

1169
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,750
vulnerability why is this important in

1170
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,610
the context of this presentation well

1171
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,110
it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SSP for Miss system</font>

1172
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,030
says that you know they do data

1173
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:26,700
validation and they strip out you know

1174
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,440
dangerous characters etc etc well why is

1175
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,839
this in place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also in this</font>

1176
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,000
particular system it's funny because the

1177
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,040
system had received an ATO from another

1178
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,200
government organization so they're like

1179
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,820
they were very surprised when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended</font>

1183
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:48,300
show you that whole ATO does not equal

fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA you know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards but even more</font>

1190
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,649
specifically with with bhisma and we

have some recent some recent laws that

00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:23,029
the problems of current<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA you have</font>

1200
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:24,319
or other organizations like sands who

1201
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:25,909
really aren't the biggest fan of a

<font color="#CCCCCC">allen polar you know and maybe other</font>

1204
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:32,569
ideas maybe we need to require

1205
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:34,880
organizations that provide services on

1206
00:48:32,569 --> 00:48:36,589

1207
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that's had much luck with the PCI</font>

1208

industry and the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue SAS and</font>

1209
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:42,099
everything you still get plenty of

00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:45,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who don't know what they're doing</font>

1211
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:47,479
so in conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I got a if you're</font>

1212
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:49,999
right on time so it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comply</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma you know it's harder to do it</font>

1214
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:53,178
right and build real security into your

1215
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:55,069
organization i think until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move away</font>

1216
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:56,989
from his paperwork mentality that

00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:58,489
affects all<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance standards we're</font>

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to move to real security and</font>

real increase of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your overall security</font>

1220
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:04,819

are moving into the right direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1222
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:08,749
think you as people who provide business

services or deal with information

security and compliance that that you

1225
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:16,880
helped educate system owners management

1226
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:19,759
on why real security needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be built</font>

1227
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the security awareness process with</font>

that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to two questions and</font>
