1
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,119
oh it's an area so

2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,990
thanks for coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to our talk and</font>

3
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,119
thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our VA second all the</font>

4
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,339
organizers volunteers I think it's been

5
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:35,170
a great conference so far so glad glad

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:37,059
they had us so our topic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day or</font>

7
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,699
for the next hour is so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchased</font>

8
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:44,349
this a stool and the implied question

9
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,849
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what now I think you know</font>

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,530
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people out there buying SAS</font>

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,480
tools and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to figure</font>

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,339
out you know maybe check a box or get

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,589
moving and they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep on looking at</font>

14
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:55,629
these HP fortifies and these check marks

15
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:57,339
and these apps can source and they buck

16
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:59,920
the status on a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> far oh I'm sorry</font>

17
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:02,320
yeah here Jake why don't you talk about

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,330
SAS a little bit so yeah why don't we we

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,479
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a quick introduction to to</font>

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,270
what we mean by sassed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gartner I mean</font>

21
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,729
the industry have kind of come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,929
couple naming conventions and just to

23
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure everyone's on the same page</font>

24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,140
when we talk about sassed and dashed and

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,640
says when we talk about SAS we're

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,280
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know static</font>

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,530
application security testing so it's

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">also you'll hear it as source could</font>

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,030
review you'll hear it as static analysis

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:35,520
for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things we're talking</font>

31
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:37,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">about looking at an application from</font>

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,679
static perspective so it's not running

33
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:43,840
you're just looking at usually the code

34
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:45,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone every company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there for the</font>

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,670
most part is doing some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dynamic</font>

36
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,679
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dash side of the house and</font>

37
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,469
for that that's your pen test that's

38
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,899
what you know security<font color="#CCCCCC"> is got a really</font>

39
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:58,990
good at for very long we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing</font>

40
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:01,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">this for a very long time but sassed and</font>

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">desks are going to find to kind of two</font>

42
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:08,109
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they can both be used</font>

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,239
to find your OS top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 type</font>

44
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,940
vulnerabilities so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,390
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Venn diagram which</font>

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,390
is huge cool you look at the center of

47
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,000
it the OS top 10 type vulnerabilities

48
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,679
like sequel injection cross-site

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,069
scripting both static and dynamic

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,780
analysis will find but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>

51
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,019
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that static analysis</font>

52
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,460
will will find a lot easier than you'll

53
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,430
find in a dynamic

54
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:39,580
so if you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like crypto issues</font>

55
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,770
if you're looking at cryptography inside

56
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,270
of static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can easily see</font>

57
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,160
when someone's role in their own crypto

58
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,160
when you're looking at from a dynamic

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,570
perspective you see a bunch of base64

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,710
encoded variables and you're like I

61
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,420
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if they're doing it right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

62
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:57,790
not static you can tell and so some

63
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,309
other issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can find our hard</font>

64
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,829
coded secrets password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the config</font>

65
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,550
files we still see all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place we</font>

66
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,830
have HSM guys so there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

67
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:12,100
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can find in static</font>

68
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,540
so it's important to kind of look at

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,190
both of those when you're actually

70
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,470
looking for vulnerabilities in your

71
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,750
environment if we have anyone from IBM

72
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,230
here who thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this looks familiar</font>

73
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,230
we do call credit out at the very bottom

74
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,730
the very bottom in the fine print in the

75
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,310
fight for<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything yeah we pulled this</font>

76
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,170
graph but we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recreate it but it</font>

77
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,930
does properly capture kind of the

78
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,109
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two methodologies</font>

79
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,360
but the next question kind of becomes

80
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,700
who's doing it I mean you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,990
these methodologies but the who out

82
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,869
there in the industry is actually doing

83
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,310
static analysis or static application

84
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,540
security testing you'll hear us use

85
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,510
these terms interchangeably throughout

86
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,160
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never use the same one but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

87
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,670
order to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to who's doing it I</font>

88
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,799
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce another topic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

89
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,070
will kind of get to some data so at

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,870
sigil we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing called the besom</font>

91
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,910
it's the building<font color="#E5E5E5"> security in maturity</font>

92
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,620
model and it's a model we established a

93
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,060
couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago back in around two</font>

94
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,130
thousand eight when the industry was

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,100
starting to really tell people how they

96
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,540
should do things they were it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

97
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,469
of a very prescriptive world there

98
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,820
there's different things and they're

99
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,230
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should do this to solve your</font>

100
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,570
security problems you should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

101
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,070
right we took a<font color="#CCCCCC"> step back and we're like</font>

102
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,020
well let's actually look at companies

103
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,840
and see what they're actually doing and

104
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,070
come up with data around it and and kind

105
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,109
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a model off of what's actually</font>

106
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,550
happening in the industry we had a lot

107
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good relationships with some banks</font>

108
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,500
and tech firms and we kind of study

109
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,810
their organizations through that study

110
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,500
and the study over the past six or seven

111
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were up to a besom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six now we've</font>

112
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of see the industry</font>

113
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,340
shift

114
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,320
watch for some trends in this data it's

115
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,190
all available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> free you know the</font>

116
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,980
model that is on BCM calm and this

117
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,920
spider chart is meant to kind of show

118
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:05,090
the different domains the the model is

119
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,660
broken into<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 practice areas and four</font>

120
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,630
domains the four domains are governance

121
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:15,920
intelligence secure sdlc<font color="#E5E5E5"> and deployment</font>

122
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:19,430
of software right there's actually 78

123
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,930
firms in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> b 76 and they performed</font>

124
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,220
over 200 some measurements of their

125
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,780
firms trying to see what they're all

126
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,020
doing sometimes they'll do it of

127
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,700
individual be use it'll do it for

128
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,229
different development groups things like

129
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,479
that to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really get a cut across</font>

130
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,980
their organization but these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

131
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">different practice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> series probably in</font>

132
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the back I can imagine you can't see</font>

133
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,890
them all but I'll just name a couple it

134
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,120
is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm this is not</font>

135
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the focus of the talk but I want to</font>

136
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce it strategy and metrics</font>

137
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,150
compliance and policy kind of going

138
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">around down to the three o'clock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

139
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,669
like attack models standards and

140
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,640
requirements but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real focus of this</font>

141
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,560
talk is let's see what's at seven

142
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,570
o'clock position which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is code review</font>

143
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,970
and it's in the same as sassed so we

144
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,020
have I break this out into the actual

145
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,600
activities that are part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

146
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,150
there's these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are let's see maybe about</font>

147
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,130
15 activities that are listed here for

148
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,729
performing code review and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

149
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,560
people are doing in the industry so to

150
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,030
go like go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a couple of these</font>

151
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,070
like at the very top it's like a level

152
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">one activity that's not meant to say</font>

153
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,500
it's easy it just means more people are

154
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,980
doing it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a lighter touch</font>

155
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,780
activity it's not super crazy difficult

156
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,850
like maybe some of the lower ones but

157
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,909
it's not a linear like the way you might

158
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,530
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CMMI type model for maturity it's</font>

159
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually kind of more we see a lot of</font>

160
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">people doing the level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one activities</font>

161
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,810
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three seems to be harder because</font>

162
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,790
not as many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do them or not as</font>

163
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,530
many groups are actually performing so

164
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,970
don't take the levels to mean like it's

165
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to do those level three</font>

166
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,790
activities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top is like</font>

167
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like use a top-end bugs list</font>

168
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,890
that simply means

169
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,030
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know all the</font>

170
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,700
vulnerabilities that are being seen

171
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,650
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization and picking like</font>

172
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,150
five of them that you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

173
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,640
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization rather than using</font>

174
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,739
like OS top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten you're going to say well</font>

175
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,510
these five or what we actually see in

176
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,890
our organization and these are the ones

177
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">we care about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we want to drive</font>

178
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:24,130
change you know throughout organization

179
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:28,360
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one dot five is mandatory code</font>

180
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,610
review so take a tool and require that

181
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,910
people scan their code and review the

182
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,310
code for security vulnerabilities

183
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:39,700
getting to like a level<font color="#CCCCCC"> two activity we</font>

184
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:42,580
have enforced coding standards that

185
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,500
might mean taking like some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know an</font>

186
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,440
external like an OAuth coding standards

187
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,480
or maybe building<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own internal</font>

188
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,350
coding standards and enforcing those

189
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,750
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool getting into let's see</font>

190
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">two dot six is like customizing the rule</font>

191
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,840
so you know a lot of people out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

192
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,960
buying the tool but then actually

193
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,840
customizing that tool and you know

194
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,520
trying to drive change via tool via the

195
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,349
customization of the rules and what

196
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,549
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for in particular if you</font>

197
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,350
can tie it to like you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

198
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">five bug list that could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font>

199
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:16,960
interesting story but you know looking

200
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I highlighted the most common</font>

201
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,789
activity and it is use an automated tool

202
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,050
so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean that means</font>

203
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:29,710
everybody well at least 55 of 78 are

204
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,420
buying static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis tools yeah that's</font>

205
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,770
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we saw as we and</font>

206
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,880
that's kind of been consistent also

207
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,130
across the different versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

208
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,309
besom over the years everybody buys a

209
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,780
tool everybody maybe puts it on there on

210
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,209
the shelf and it becomes shelf where I

211
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,920
don't know it they plop it in the

212
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,170
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hey we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check the box we</font>

213
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,449
have static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> capability are we</font>

214
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,250
actually using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Beason doesn't</font>

215
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,860
actually say are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it well it</font>

216
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">just says whether you did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an activity or</font>

217
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,900
not so all this means is they have an

218
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,790
automated tool and they scanned some

219
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,870
code doesn't mean anything about they

220
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,939
got good coverage across the

221
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:09,400
organization or they're driving change

222
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:11,950
with the tool so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that why do why</font>

223
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,640
does the industry just<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy tools I might</font>

224
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,780
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys that question at</font>

225
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,180
the fact if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to come talk to me</font>

226
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:20,660
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a few theories I think it's</font>

227
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,569
easy to buy a tool most people you know

228
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,980
you can bet the technology you can get

229
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,330
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and kind of understand the</font>

230
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,370
different the ins and outs of the tools

231
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,650
you know you you know your frameworks

232
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,950
you know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> codebase you know your IDs</font>

233
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,630
perhaps so it's relatively easy to vet

234
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,790
the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe get through the</font>

235
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,960
budgeting process I don't know maybe

236
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,300
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to the budgeting</font>

237
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,610
process but for you know people get the

238
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,709
tools in the end and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens but</font>

239
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,560
then they got to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll out the</font>

240
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,480
tool in it within the organization and

241
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,920
people tend to hit a wall there you know

242
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,810
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> people they have to drive change</font>

243
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,610
you have to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to actually use</font>

244
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,040
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where there's a</font>

245
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:01,630
wall we tend to hear a couple of

246
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,760
different complaints the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> is noisy</font>

247
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,580
is a very common one you know there's a

248
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,040
ton of false positives or this tool

249
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,940
slows down my developer workflow those

250
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,980
are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> common walls that people run</font>

251
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,210
into when they after they bought a tool

252
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,280
so they got through the easy step

253
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:23,240
they're ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build out a program and</font>

254
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,430
then no one does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because it's so slow</font>

255
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,050
it's hurting my developers we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

256
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,810
to market you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason</font>

257
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,579
is you're starting to bum me out man I

258
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,140
know it's a bummer there are good things

259
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,540
about static<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis that they're</font>

260
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,510
absolutely some benefits because like I

261
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,520
said 55 firms that we measure or the 78

262
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,990
or doing it so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some benefits</font>

263
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,329
well if you see at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom we have I</font>

264
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:50,080
we have the SS DLC so you're secure

265
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:53,200
software development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle and</font>

266
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,780
historically when when firms start

267
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,710
testing they<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually do the test from my</font>

268
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:04,430
assurance perspective so running dynamic

269
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:05,750
penetration tests at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> far end so just</font>

270
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,189
before you're going to feedback from the

271
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,760
field is when you're starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

272
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,590
your software by starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do static</font>

273
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,319
analysis you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually move it to the</font>

274
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,450
left and start to start to find them

275
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,660
easier we did save you from seeing the

276
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:23,690
slide that every bug presentation i'm

277
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,610
pretty sure has shown of overtime the

278
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,760
longer it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes you to find</font>

279
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,440
the more expensive it is everyone's I'm

280
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,029
getting some nods everyone seen this

281
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,579
slide time and time you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

282
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:38,360
in here so you're welcome we'll just

283
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:40,219
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but so when you when you</font>

284
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,260
start to do static analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

285
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,250
you're actually moving further to the

286
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,700
left and it's in an insurance model you

287
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,230
can still do static analysis at that

288
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">rightmost phase but you can move it to</font>

289
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the left and as code is being developed</font>

290
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:58,959
perform testing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big benefit to</font>

291
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,860
this the one of the single most

292
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,750
important benefits is that you're

293
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,360
helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change developer behavior</font>

294
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,339
you're no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolting on security</font>

295
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,019
once you've finished your project once

296
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:10,850
you've gotten a feature complete you're

297
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,220
not then going oh wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> now how do we</font>

298
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,170
secure it you're moving to the left and

299
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,940
actually changing developer behavior so

300
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're building secure code from</font>

301
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the start and not waiting until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

302
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,440
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it secure and you can change</font>

303
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,769
developer behavior in a number of ways

304
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,620
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the easiest ways is providing</font>

305
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,329
code specific feedback so instead of

306
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,339
saying you have sequel injection and

307
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:36,260
it's on this page I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

308
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,740
where in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your code it happens you can</font>

309
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:42,800
say on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> line in this file you are</font>

310
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,110
you are introducing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an untrusted input</font>

311
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,079
and flushing it right back to the user

312
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to do sanitization you can give</font>

313
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:55,969
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the spot very accurate</font>

314
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,680
remediation advice and one of the really

315
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,079
cool things that you can do as well in

316
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,099
your organization is use static analysis

317
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,019
to start enforcing coding standards

318
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,680
that's not specific to security either

319
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:12,140
if you have standards of you must use X

320
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,819
wires that framework you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put that in</font>

321
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">a static analysis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tool and actually</font>

322
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:22,399
check and tell them about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but there</font>

323
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some some truths that we hold to be</font>

324
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,720
self-evident and in the first is that

325
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">out-of-the-box static</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis tools are</font>

326
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,120
noisy there are a lot of false positives

327
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:41,010
and there are a lot of false negatives

328
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:43,490
I think yeah yeah so out of the box or a

329
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,350
lot that's actually by design though

330
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,810
they want to report as much as possible

331
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,360
to you as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security person you have the</font>

332
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,900
knowledge to filter down and actually

333
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,400
trim out but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this there's if</font>

334
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,410
there's one thing you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

335
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,170
this talk and I would be so happy if you

336
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,800
did stop asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your false positive</font>

337
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,089
ratio is it's a bad question they're all

338
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,829
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of false positives</font>

339
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,900
unless they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not telling you</font>

340
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,089
everything you need in which case you're

341
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at more false negatives now yeah</font>

342
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,610
we'll talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about tuning that in a</font>

343
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,529
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's the way they're</font>

344
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,360
designed the tools are meant to find a

345
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,640
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different things for coverage</font>

346
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,920
purposes so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit in a</font>

347
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,589
few slides about like how you can take

348
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that noisy engine that creates tons and</font>

349
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,950
tons maybe thousands of findings and

350
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,960
pare that down something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

351
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,480
take action<font color="#CCCCCC"> on yeah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

352
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,790
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that regardless of what tool</font>

353
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,040
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploying way when we're talking</font>

354
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,839
about static analysis tool there are a

355
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple other things that always always</font>

356
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,310
are true and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

357
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,300
deployment model matters and we'll talk

358
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,609
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about deployment models here but</font>

359
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,959
really we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about how is the</font>

360
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,560
tool deployed inside of your

361
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:58,109
organization and it's not a simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

362
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,329
of you just install it on a server you

363
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,100
walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away and you're done there are</font>

364
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,290
models for how your<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and your</font>

365
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,000
process have to align around the

366
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,520
technology at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day it's</font>

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,630
people process technology over and over

368
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:15,779
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and technology but when</font>

369
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,459
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at these it's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

370
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,500
select the right technology but then

371
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:23,430
it's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important to build the</font>

372
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,170
right capabilities around that and to

373
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point one thing that's that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

374
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,900
important is the cost of a static

375
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis tool isn't just in licensing</font>

376
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,100
because every every static analysis tool

377
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,170
is going to take an investment in terms

378
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:43,020
of training your people in the process

379
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in the technology and also the time</font>

380
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,220
cost and actually rolling out and

381
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,560
deploying static analysis tools because

382
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,750
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a again it's not a flip the</font>

383
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,239
switch and you now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have static analysis</font>

384
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we'll talk more about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

385
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:03,460
boarding but when we actually look at

386
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:06,970
what are what are the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of</font>

387
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,340
static analysis I again there's there's

388
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,490
kind of a shift moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the right to</font>

389
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,830
the left of the SS<font color="#CCCCCC"> dlc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and normally when</font>

390
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,690
you when when companies start doing

391
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,910
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis they start at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

392
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,590
right with assurance testing they wait

393
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,900
for the code to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be complete and then</font>

394
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,940
they have a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert going we're</font>

395
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,569
on a scan of the code do some manual

396
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,540
probing and doing essentially an

397
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:35,590
assurance test so you're you're assuring

398
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,240
that nothing is inside of your code but

399
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is after the codes already been</font>

400
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed you can actually start to</font>

401
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">shift left on that one the SS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DLC and</font>

402
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,890
start to detect things earlier and with

403
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,390
the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> detection mode we're</font>

404
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,510
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that that second tier</font>

405
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,949
where you have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> static analysis</font>

406
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,930
when the build server so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

407
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,640
now that developers are starting to lean

408
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,429
more heavily to continuous integration

409
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,819
continuous deployment we're seeing this

410
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:12,070
is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more common model of</font>

411
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,960
installing on the build server a static

412
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">analysis tool so that when you run your</font>

413
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,010
nightly or your weekly builds you can

414
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,939
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan your code at that point</font>

415
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,250
and get back to the developers

416
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,950
vulnerabilities that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified</font>

417
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,780
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a mostly automated process</font>

418
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,060
that just kicks off Intel's your

419
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,800
developers you know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on as</font>

420
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,740
they're just doing their business as

421
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,830
usual and then to move the furthest left

422
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,620
the the newest trend that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting</font>

423
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,629
to see in a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations is</font>

424
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,840
more of a prevention model and that's

425
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,050
running static analysis inside of your

426
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,230
IDE inside of a developer's IDE running

427
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:56,080
quick checks just things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

428
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,240
flag to developers instantly so that

429
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,159
they know they're introducing a security

430
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,900
vulnerability before that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes into</font>

431
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,220
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

432
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:07,740
satori so some easy examples of this

433
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,720
would be again the basic easy ones are

434
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,570
always sequel injection right you can

435
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,470
all you can check inside of the IDE if a

436
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,659
developer has has used<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dynamic query</font>

437
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,340
and you can say hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't do</font>

438
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should use parameterize queries</font>

439
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,090
here's how you do it and then they save

440
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,800
they check in their code without that

441
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,760
vulnerability and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've saved a</font>

442
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,590
tremendous amount of headaches yeah so

443
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,240
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is heavily about the</font>

444
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,100
technology but we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't talked</font>

445
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,840
about really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and process so</font>

446
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,629
let's talk a little bit about deployment

447
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,100
models we have we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into</font>

448
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">each one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these so if you can't quite</font>

449
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,850
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> although it actually is larger</font>

450
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,840
than I expected we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

451
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,000
about each to one of the different

452
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,340
models<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the whole model at the bottom</font>

453
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,740
is moving from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decentralized model</font>

454
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,840
towards a more centralized model of you

455
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,840
know who's actually doing the code

456
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,250
review and the running<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tools the</font>

457
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,050
interesting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted to point</font>

458
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">out here was actually the trend we tend</font>

459
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,840
to see across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country so on the East</font>

460
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Coast we tend to see people having a</font>

461
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,020
central service bureau we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

462
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,919
talk about what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means but that keep</font>

463
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,200
that in mind as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

464
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,850
deployment models they it's just kind of

465
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">something we've observed the East Coast</font>

466
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,830
tends to have central service bureaus

467
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,750
the Midwest<font color="#E5E5E5"> tends to have security as a</font>

468
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,760
service where they like to you may have

469
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,250
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party do it or some sort of on</font>

470
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,710
demand service and then on the west

471
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,090
coast you see more the automation the

472
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">build integration and continuous</font>

473
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:37,560
integration aspect of it yeah so that's

474
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,659
just just a trend we've observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

475
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,600
we work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> really organizations across</font>

476
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,700
the country so an interesting trend but

477
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we if we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the</font>

478
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,430
different ways that static analysis

479
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools are deployed we inserted that at</font>

480
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:55,710
the leftmost and the more of the self

481
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,590
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> model and this is the build</font>

482
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,210
integration piece and in this piece you

483
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">have sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the build server that</font>

484
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,090
developments working on the static

485
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,460
analysis tool will run there and give

486
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,770
give the feedback directly to the

487
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,320
developers this is really the fastest

488
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,168
model because the only person involved

489
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,230
with

490
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:19,239
scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the triage is the developer and</font>

491
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,460
then they can reach out to security as

492
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:23,259
they have questions but this is this is

493
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,619
getting the results to them as<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

494
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:28,899
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and you can integrate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

495
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:32,320
inside of their workflow so that it

496
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:35,469
becomes part of their BAU the cons

497
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,129
because it is being run by a developer

498
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:42,399
and not necessarily securities to me

499
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:45,219
there's a heavy upfront cost to setting

500
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:48,008
up the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to customizing it in</font>

501
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,970
such a way that it actually makes the

502
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:54,429
developers life more easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it doesn't</font>

503
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,100
overly complicate and make them hunt

504
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:59,950
through google foo for hours about what

505
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,738
a specific vulnerability is so that

506
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,950
upfront cost is a lot higher for belt

507
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:08,980
integration but it's less noisy and a

508
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:11,859
little easier when the developers when

509
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,070
you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up correctly one of the risks</font>

510
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:17,379
with it is typically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

511
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,840
self-reporting model because security

512
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:21,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't necessarily go through and prune</font>

513
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,399
the results they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily</font>

514
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,720
keeping track of what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

515
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:28,238
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just waiting for developers to</font>

516
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,149
tell them what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've identified from</font>

517
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:32,830
there static analysis and on the

518
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,168
developers getting the results directly

519
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,658
that can be a problem however<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in</font>

520
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:40,059
this model will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about customizing</font>

521
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:41,470
rules such that this might be a little

522
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,178
bit easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> because in this one if they</font>

523
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,639
get those results directly from the tool

524
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:47,619
the number one thing we hear is oh so

525
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,889
many findings like what do I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

526
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:52,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know huge report of 30,000</font>

527
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:54,699
vulnerabilities maybe more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like code</font>

528
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,840
coverage issues or something but I'll

529
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little bit about pruning that</font>

530
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,488
down but go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> venner abilities with</font>

531
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:04,119
?<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gulnar abilities you know issues</font>

532
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:06,100
something so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move if we move a</font>

533
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:08,529
little further to the right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more</font>

534
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,840
centralized model another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

535
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:15,489
see very often is a scanning factory

536
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">where in a scanning factory the</font>

537
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:19,840
developer will upload their code have it

538
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,490
or on it'll come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they'll</font>

539
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,510
prune out what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

540
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,970
and send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the security team</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

541
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,350
review the final result and that way

542
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,179
you've you fix some of the

543
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,850
self-reporting although there is a

544
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:37,900
component of that the security experts

545
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:40,449
arguing involved more and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this does</font>

546
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,210
help scale out because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know an</font>

547
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,309
organization that has as many security

548
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,170
people as they have developers I don't

549
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:50,440
know an organization that has a security

550
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">person for every 20 developers the besom</font>

551
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">date is something like 2 / 2 or 3 per</font>

552
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,170
100 developers security people so so so

553
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,879
this way you're not fully centralized

554
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,980
and you're not you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

555
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,720
your security<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources for just static</font>

556
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,550
analysis so this does help scale out but

557
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">again some of the cons means you have to</font>

558
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">have security expertise and house to to</font>

559
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,850
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to really help the developers</font>

560
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,980
and there is a licensing costs issue

561
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,419
with this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it tends to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of</font>

562
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,309
expensive and require a number of

563
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,290
licenses again that depends on the tool

564
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:28,809
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we've we've</font>

565
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,879
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a number of places but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're</font>

566
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,129
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> shift further right on that</font>

567
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,860
scale and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the last of the the</font>

568
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,740
main models that we see for deployment

569
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,689
and that's the the service bureau so

570
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,350
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self-service you can</font>

571
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,820
get this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has your your developers will</font>

572
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,120
supply their source code to this

573
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,760
security sm8 who will go through and go

574
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,250
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and run static analysis will prune</font>

575
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,020
and do all of the triage required and

576
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,500
give back actionable results to the

577
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,850
developer the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pro here is that</font>

578
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,850
your developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting what they</font>

579
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to fix they're not getting a list</font>

580
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bugs that they are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to research</font>

581
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,040
if they should be worrying about but you

582
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,890
can get you have your essentially your

583
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,420
security people are doing a lot of the

584
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,490
lifting for your developers so that

585
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,179
developers can focus on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need</font>

586
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,340
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing it turns to be a fairly low</font>

587
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:27,010
licensing costs model because you're

588
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">just buying licenses for your security</font>

589
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,900
folks as opposed to every built server

590
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,949
you have out there or every developer

591
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,620
where every developer

592
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,420
yeah and then the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> con here is</font>

593
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,929
that it does tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the slowest</font>

594
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,700
model and require a lot of upkeep to

595
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,710
make sure that the security person is

596
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,810
getting everything they need and we'll

597
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:49,150
talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the some of the pains</font>

598
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,610
that that security people will have as

599
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,970
they start to own board applications and

600
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:57,280
scan applications well yeah so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

601
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,840
far we've kind of talked about people in

602
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process now with deployment models</font>

603
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,669
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really hope you get</font>

604
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">started so we thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good to</font>

605
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,600
kind of hit on some themes that we think

606
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,650
are important when people really

607
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,820
purchase the tool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're ready to</font>

608
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:14,230
roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the program you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

609
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,909
the for the most part across the

610
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,190
industry like I said earlier you

611
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,080
qualifying and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what tool</font>

612
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,930
you need is something we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well</font>

613
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,179
so looking at things like the language

614
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,070
support or exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you think it'll</font>

615
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,750
roll out best in the organization people

616
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,270
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that pretty well ask the</font>

617
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,750
right questions but when it comes to

618
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:37,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next challenge is coming to</font>

619
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,220
onboarding the applications so what the

620
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,320
main thing here is don't bite off more

621
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,200
than you can chew like try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

622
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,950
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of applications ready to go and</font>

623
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,840
and bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you know one or two primary</font>

624
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,460
applications and do some scanning and

625
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
triaging with the security group<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

626
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,030
that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to teach your security</font>

627
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,520
group the things that are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up most</font>

628
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,170
often by the static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis tools so</font>

629
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can start to say well we're going to</font>

630
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,420
bring in a couple applications really

631
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,250
get their buy-in to the program and then

632
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually they'll help probably even</font>

633
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,640
evangelize it across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization to</font>

634
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,719
get other groups in it like hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

635
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,700
security actually really helped us out

636
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,120
on this one versus being a blocker which

637
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the other message and we're</font>

638
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about customizing</font>

639
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,340
rule packs but the important thing here

640
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,899
is then maturing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program that does</font>

641
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,480
not mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to be like immediately</font>

642
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,680
right off the bat<font color="#E5E5E5"> but over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next you</font>

643
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">know once you purchase a tool over the</font>

644
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,910
next couple of years mature the program

645
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,260
at by customizing rule packs and really

646
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,890
starting to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on nation in there</font>

647
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:37,530
to help you know drive it quicker and

648
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:40,600
and cut down on the noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

649
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,950
everyone always wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about so</font>

650
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,240
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about onboarding a</font>

651
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,410
little bit more yeah before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go too</font>

652
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,720
far into the mature

653
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,080
the one boarding is a huge piece of

654
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:54,340
having a successful deployment of a vast

655
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,620
attic analysis tool so the overall flow

656
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,360
for how onboarding works first

657
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,300
absolutely starts with setting the

658
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,250
expectations correctly with every

659
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:07,350
security deployment you have to set

660
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:10,450
expectations and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

661
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:14,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone in the process knows what's</font>

662
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,960
going on if you select no matter what

663
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,389
deployment model you select it will

664
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,340
require some training for your either

665
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,400
your developers or security people are

666
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,500
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's important to set</font>

667
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,570
expectations up front of what people's

668
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,300
roles are and to start the training

669
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:35,139
process early as opposed to you know

670
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:41,440
when you've started to mandate static

671
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:43,030
analysis a big suggestion to save a lot

672
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,160
of hassle is to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an</font>

673
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,370
application that<font color="#E5E5E5"> either you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

674
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">best or one of the most responsive</font>

675
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,360
development teams if there's a

676
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,260
development team that you know you can

677
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:00,100
bribe with pizza and beer go for them

678
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:02,560
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important to to make</font>

679
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,240
sure that when you're one born in these

680
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,460
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a team that will</font>

681
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,790
go above and beyond to help make it

682
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,440
successful so some of the problems that

683
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:14,909
will see when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start when you start</font>

684
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:19,210
scanning as you'll get some source code

685
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:21,970
some not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all rarely do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

686
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,860
project your first time of asking so

687
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,360
it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the development</font>

688
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">team realize that they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

689
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

690
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,290
have the complete project that you're

691
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,620
scanning and then once you go to build

692
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:37,600
it make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it actually builds</font>

693
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,189
there are a number of tools out there

694
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,919
that that say they work without

695
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,570
requiring a full build<font color="#E5E5E5"> because after all</font>

696
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,840
they're just looking at code they can

697
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,580
make assumptions and guesses but we find

698
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,970
that when you do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results aren't</font>

699
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,370
nearly as good and it

700
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,640
becomes even noisy for security person

701
00:28:52,370 --> 00:29:00,260
to go through and see what they figure

702
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">is trusted or untrusted frameworks and</font>

703
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:07,640
if you just work up front with your

704
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:09,650
development team to fully build the

705
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,710
fully build the application you'll get

706
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:15,910
much better static analysis results so

707
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:18,650
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> then triaging the results and</font>

708
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,880
you know there's a there's an activity

709
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,310
there in when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing</font>

710
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,220
application in and ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start doing</font>

00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security testing the static security</font>

712
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,670
testing on it where you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

713
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,380
through the results that you found on

<font color="#E5E5E5">that specific application but we to in</font>

715
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,490
order to mature the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program then the</font>

716
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,560
next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> is starting to pull some of</font>

717
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,230
the themes from what you found and

718
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,250
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how you're going to</font>

719
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,380
customize the rules because that's

720
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,610
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

721
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,230
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most important part of it</font>

722
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you're going to head off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

723
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,870
issues of we find too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with</font>

724
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,220
static analysis it's too soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> nosy if</font>

725
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,560
you start customizing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule pack and</font>

726
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,300
you learn from the triaging step which

727
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,340
is when that security person is helping

728
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">bringing that application in and they</font>

729
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,300
get that first scan done they triage

730
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,520
they start to find some of the themes or

731
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,280
the main vulnerabilities you can now

732
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,639
start to drive that into custom rule

733
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,280
packs so Jake wouldn't let me put it's

734
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,600
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here I think this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

735
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,700
important part at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very least i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

736
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,149
know if it's easy all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools have a</font>

737
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:25,040
way for you to customize rule packs they

738
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,960
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their own specific formats for</font>

739
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,139
doing it things some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font>

740
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">xml markup language type thing some of</font>

741
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,520
them are actually their own like query

742
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:37,280
language for reviewing the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> however</font>

743
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,670
it does it figure out how it does it and

744
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,930
then customize rules it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

745
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,990
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's most important part because</font>

746
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:48,020
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really accomplish all three</font>

747
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:50,180
tiers that that Jake presented on

748
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:53,000
prevention detection and assurance with

749
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:56,180
different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rollbacks so the way</font>

750
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,280
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do this I take that rule pack</font>

751
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,590
that's default or that comes with the

752
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,629
product and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep that as my</font>

753
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,270
assurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll back I want the noisiest</font>

754
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,770
thing

755
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,930
you can possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> find I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

756
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,879
coverage and as a security guy I'm like

757
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,710
give me the false positives I'll review

758
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,870
them i'll let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where the real</font>

759
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,520
issues are so I want that noisy rule

760
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,550
pack that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tier 3 assurance side</font>

761
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,810
and as a I guess this me I don't know if

762
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,600
I miss me but I you know I know a little

763
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit about code I will go through those</font>

764
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,980
things and I will find of all this noise

765
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll probably prune out some and give</font>

766
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,460
you the real results but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep that</font>

767
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,419
rule pack around because you want the

768
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,710
coverage throughout all the application

769
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,940
and then what I'm going to do is I'm

770
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to triage that out and give the</font>

771
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,690
ones that really matter whether it's

772
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,040
through bug tracking or directly in a

773
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,900
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give the ones that</font>

774
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,250
matter to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development team now I'm</font>

775
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get in the tier 2 i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

776
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,910
build my own separate rule pack this

777
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,290
whoever is working in tier 2 will never

778
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,960
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the other ones if i had to</font>

779
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,760
control this where i'm going to you know

780
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,290
maybe tees down on some of those noisier

781
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,500
rules cut those out and really focus on

782
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:05,639
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess the less noisy ones and</font>

783
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,420
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more critical rules or some</font>

784
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the ones that are a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

785
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,160
accurate and what they find so that that

786
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:14,370
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the build if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did this in a build</font>

787
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,470
integration type model when it scans it

788
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,030
every night the developers getting a

789
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,590
little bit more targeted results there

790
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,639
might still be some noise but they're

791
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,669
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get something that they can</font>

792
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">take action on most likely and we can</font>

793
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,310
have a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the rest of</font>

794
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,760
them you know like but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

795
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:32,340
get some top findings the tier 1 pack

796
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,129
what i would do is make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like five</font>

797
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,810
issues you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 that out that I</font>

798
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">would find in tier 1 which is going to</font>

799
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">be in that prevention something either</font>

800
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,010
in the IDE or something that's automatic

801
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,389
or as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they build it type a model</font>

802
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,940
because what that's going to do you get

803
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,770
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe the five rules that your</font>

804
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,760
organization's trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the five</font>

805
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,040
vulnerabilities that your organization

806
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,420
is trying to eradicate and get rid of

807
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a problem with any more</font>

808
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,890
going to get those as early as I can so

809
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,930
that you can head off those issues and

810
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,610
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> later you know you find some of</font>

811
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:06,480
them may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more subtle vulnerabilities</font>

812
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,740
right the tools have those and some of

813
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,440
them are particularly well-liked sequel

814
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,620
injection can be found by every tool so

815
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,240
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one into the Tier one type</font>

816
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,559
model and

817
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,679
you're going to head off those issues

818
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,420
early but something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an input</font>

819
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,640
validation rule which is common in a

820
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,190
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis tool that those are</font>

821
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,929
particularly noisy and I may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> want my</font>

822
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,490
developer to get that on their desktop

823
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:30,720
all the time because they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

824
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,040
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with this</font>

825
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,500
it's a false positive well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

826
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,260
necessarily a false positive so i'll

827
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">leave that triage to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the central</font>

828
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,830
group the security group and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll give</font>

829
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,570
them the ones that i really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

830
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:45,960
rid of and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll write some custom rules</font>

831
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:49,050
that I that I know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about as an</font>

832
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:52,380
organization the nice thing about that

833
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:54,210
is it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will tag well to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

834
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">sent program or the be sent model</font>

835
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,040
because just by talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and</font>

836
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:02,730
I'll go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of the levels we</font>

837
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,920
have code review 1 dot 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 3 3 being</font>

838
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,590
accomplished one not one is use a top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

839
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,330
list or a top endless whatever you

840
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,830
prefer maybe even a top one we're going

841
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:14,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to eliminate this vulnerability this</font>

842
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:16,590
year you can put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that role</font>

843
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,379
pack that's on every developers you know

844
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:21,510
light rule pack and then hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

845
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:25,020
can eradicate it which is a code review

846
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,700
33 so if you take those two just doing

847
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,100
this type of a model<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the Rope X you</font>

848
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,330
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock out to be some activities if</font>

849
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,779
that's what you're driving towards I

850
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,759
know everyone is or you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

851
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,359
actually can start to say we have

852
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,330
eliminated top 5 from the OS top 10

853
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we got it immediately feeding</font>

854
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,929
back into the developers workflow and

855
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:50,129
that's just via the Tier one type of a

856
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">rule pack I know like check marks is</font>

857
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,449
another static analysis tool secure

858
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:56,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">assists as a static analysis tool they</font>

859
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:58,169
check marks has a programmatic way to do

860
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,180
it it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a query language that they</font>

861
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:03,690
use to write custom rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure Issus</font>

862
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,640
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an XML markup so once you kind of get</font>

863
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,590
in there and see like okay this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I</font>

864
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,730
write a custom rule from that part it's

865
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,470
easy which is why I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to leave</font>

866
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,210
it's easy in there because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think once</font>

867
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,609
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does it a certain way</font>

868
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can just create rules create</font>

869
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:17,369
different rule packs you can have

870
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,470
different ones to solve different jobs

871
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:21,390
and you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to the people that are</font>

872
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,640
doing certain things perhaps there's a

873
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,250
development group that has specific

874
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,839
framework that they're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and</font>

875
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,530
that has a certain vulnerability tied to

876
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,660
it

877
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:33,210
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it in a certain way that's a</font>

878
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,080
custom rule type scenario and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm only</font>

879
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the development</font>

880
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,049
teams that I know are working with that

881
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,010
framework I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to give it to</font>

882
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,200
everyone because everyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

883
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:45,690
like why did this rule fire it's not

884
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">related to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

885
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,960
know with if you pick the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

886
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,300
process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the deployment</font>

887
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,310
models you start to drive custom rules

888
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,130
we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've accomplished some</font>

889
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:59,330
decent activities so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back into</font>

890
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,620
this we started off at just one not for

891
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:03,900
which is use automated tool that's what

892
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:07,859
everybody does everybody buys a tool and

893
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,330
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> consent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scans some code but if</font>

894
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,360
you take all the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we</font>

895
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,549
just talked about and you drive them we

896
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:18,360
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this I</font>

897
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:20,280
can show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a full program because</font>

898
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,590
we have level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three good coverage in a</font>

899
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,840
level two and a level one and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

900
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:28,740
can get a little farther because like a

901
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">32 which is build a factory that might</font>

902
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,790
be there depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which deployment</font>

903
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,340
model you choose so I left it unchecked

904
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,920
because it kind of depends but something

905
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,200
like eradicate a bug or customizing the

906
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,570
rule pack well we've already checked

907
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:47,060
those as activities that will do as a

908
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:50,220
part of just editing the rules right or

909
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:53,790
let's see mandatory code reviews well if

910
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,609
it's happening in the IDE or in the

911
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,650
build you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the mandatory</font>

912
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,750
part check so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could check that box</font>

913
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,670
and the top end bugs list that's how

914
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,500
you're driving that down any way into

915
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:07,850
the custom rule so we check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one so</font>

916
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have good solid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BCM focused program</font>

917
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:13,319
and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that is oh we</font>

918
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,390
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> out centralized reporting out of</font>

919
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,230
all of this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there is obviously</font>

920
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,520
everyone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a track data on what</font>

921
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,840
you're actually finding and showing

922
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,370
return on investment and all that we

923
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,830
left that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of out of out of the</font>

924
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:28,350
scope of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk but you know with all</font>

925
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,730
these different ones the the results

926
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,770
feeding back into some sort of central

927
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,240
reporting you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more</font>

928
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,890
targeted results you're going to see

929
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,740
better data in your central reporting

930
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,330
system if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the custom rules the</font>

931
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,160
way we kind of laid out there with those

932
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,140
different tiers

933
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,270
so is that going from zero to rocket

934
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,549
science yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is 0-2 rocket</font>

935
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:48,780
science we said it's easy right but

936
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:50,099
there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you got to get in there</font>

937
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,049
and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of learn a little bit about the</font>

938
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,730
custom rule development but once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

939
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:58,829
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and it's like i said it's</font>

940
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:02,190
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml you know we can handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

941
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:04,950
really a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

942
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,140
kind of concluding thoughts really the

943
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:11,819
big static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools out there the</font>

944
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:14,460
HP fortify the the IBM apps can source

945
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:15,710
check marks secure assist these tools

946
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,240
that are out there are very powerful

947
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're going to find a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

948
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,160
vulnerabilities and we really have to

949
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,660
customize and build out with them

950
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,029
because they're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the box they are</font>

951
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,779
that noisy tool a lot of findings and

952
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:33,089
we've talked about static analysis

953
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,770
exclusively and this talk but but really

954
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:37,440
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important to note</font>

955
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,750
despite what marketing will tell you

956
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,599
there is no silver bullet there is

957
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:45,299
there's no if you buy this tool you have

958
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,460
now solved your security problem I know

959
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:49,380
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis of lenders love to say</font>

960
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's just not the truth a</font>

961
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,380
holistic approach is required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

962
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you're looking for bugs and flaws</font>

963
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,240
throughout your organization and really

964
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:02,250
working to build secure code from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

965
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,450
beginning yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was</font>

966
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,500
interesting because we were over in one

967
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,049
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other talks and they were talking</font>

968
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,670
about dynamic pen testing and running

969
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,710
tools where they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of false</font>

970
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,599
positives it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same message</font>

971
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,329
for the two different application

972
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,940
security testing models or methodologies

973
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:19,559
where you're saying it you know just

974
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,510
purchasing the tool isn't going to solve

975
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,390
the problem necessarily but building the

976
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,559
program and people and process<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

977
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:28,680
that technology is what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

978
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know get you the next level we</font>

979
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to always remember that the cost to</font>

980
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:35,098
remediate is always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go higher</font>

981
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:39,149
the longer the bug remains undiscovered

982
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:40,230
right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's so with static analysis</font>

983
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,970
you're going to find those things

984
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,440
earlier in particular with the custom

985
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,649
role pack in the tier 1 I think you're

986
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see that that kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of metric</font>

987
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,190
show up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better because you're</font>

988
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:51,869
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see things getting solved</font>

989
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,839
you're not going to see a sequel

990
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,059
injection in a pen

991
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:57,489
because you found a custom rule pack

992
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,469
that is going to really drive that out

993
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:01,299
of the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets to a dynamic</font>

994
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:03,460
pen test and you found it something else

995
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:05,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">went wrong right you found a sequel</font>

996
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,829
injection but you have a good rule set

997
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:10,719
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else went wrong paper into one</font>

998
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:12,880
of three parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> to roll in now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

999
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:17,739
aesthetic analysis qualify implemented

1000
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,479
mature now so the key thing from from

1001
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:22,450
our perspective is it's all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1002
