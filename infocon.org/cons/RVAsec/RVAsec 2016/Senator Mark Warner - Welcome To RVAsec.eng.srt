00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:27,800
hi I want to welcome everyone to the RV

2
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,770
a security conference I wish I could be

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,599
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in person but you all know that</font>

4
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a world of enormous</font>

5
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:38,540
challenges I<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely agree with FBI</font>

6
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,980
director Comey that virtually every

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,530
American company falls into either one

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,949
of two categories either a company that

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">no they been hacked by the Chinese in</font>

10
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:49,610
terms of cyber crime or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company that</font>

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,040
may not know they've been hacked by the

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,989
Chinese but chances are they have as a

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,989
member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Senate Committee on</font>

14
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:59,468
Intelligence I see evidence every day of

15
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,358
the enormous threat that cyber security

16
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,530
confronts public sector private sector

17
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,660
and all aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our national economy</font>

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,060
but with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that challenge also comes</font>

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,950
opportunity you know there's over a

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,610
hundred and twenty billion dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,450
loss this year due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybercrime</font>

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,360
unfortunately that's going to be a

23
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing number it also though presents</font>

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,050
an opportunity there are over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200,000</font>

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,839
unfilled cyber security jobs in America

26
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,970
in Virginia with close that close to

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,759
eighteen thousand of those unfilled jobs

28
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,369
jobs that start on average about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 88,000</font>

29
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,830
dollars is an enormous opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

30
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:44,509
in in Virginia we are uniquely situated

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,489
we have enormous<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel opportunities we</font>

32
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,349
have enormous capacity in terms of the

33
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:51,289
federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> government we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots and lots</font>

34
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:54,050
of the private sector cyber companies we

35
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,610
obviously from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> port and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Navy</font>

39
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:05,440
Blacksburg Virginia Tech we could make

40
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,449
Virginia the leader in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,190
in cyber renovation how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that</font>

42
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,619
well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking forward to some of the</font>

43
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,020
work from this conference but I believe

44
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work in two areas one we need</font>

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure that we have that cyber</font>

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,230
workforce so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been working with the</font>

47
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,180
McAuliffe administration as we make try

48
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,920
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that from community</font>

49
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,920
colleges to our four-year institutions

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,319
we have each of those institutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font>

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,149
certified because quite honestly many of

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,280
these jobs in cyber don't require

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,100
graduate degrees or even 40

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,140
degrees but you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entry into</font>

55
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,370
this growing field even with a two-year

56
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,829
degree we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all our</font>

57
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,319
schools have that cyber certifications

58
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,690
of excellence second we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,269
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work with DoD the Intel</font>

60
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,890
community and others and say that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

61
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,770
the innovation that's taking place in

cyber isn't taking place only in the

63
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,150
Silicon Valley we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

64
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we continue to promote Northern</font>

65
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,470
Virginia Hampton Roads Richmond there's

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,630
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cyber innovation a lot of cyber</font>

67
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,850
entrepreneurs in the Commonwealth of

68
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,859
Virginia and part of my job is making

69
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,500
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these new entrepreneurial</font>

70
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,450
companies get opportunities to get

71
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">access to business with the federal</font>

72
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,760
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then third we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

73
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,370
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do a better job</font>

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,840
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our unique proximity to the</font>

75
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,640
federal government<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having our</font>

76

workforce being able to move from the

78
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,079
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth that means making sure</font>

79
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,550
that we work on security clearances and

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,459
greater collaboration from the public

81
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,500
sector and the private sector this is a

82
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,810
great area of concern I personally

83
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we think about our</font>

84
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,350
nation's defense cyber security needs to

85
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">be elevated to a higher command</font>

86
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,060
structure and quite honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

87
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,070
forward our defense capabilities are not

88
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,739
going to have to simply be in the land

89
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,799
on the air and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the sea but also a</font>

90
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,470
fourth domain in terms of cyber this is

91
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,660
a issue of national security it's an

92
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,690
issue of personal security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

93
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,040
it's an issue of economic security with

94
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that challenge though comes the</font>

95
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,230
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my hope is that Virginia</font>

96
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:18,440
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> known</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the cyber capital for</font>

97
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,209
America I look forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the results of</font>

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">your conference and look forward to</font>

99
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,970
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you to make that happen</font>

100
