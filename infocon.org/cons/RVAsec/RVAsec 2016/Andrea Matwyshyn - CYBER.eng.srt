of a paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm currently completing</font>

called cyber all caps ! ironic title so

00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,670
Who am I I am a law professor and a

with rolling computer scientists and

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,810
also Stanford's Center for Internet and

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,420
speaking at hacker cons since 2003 black

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,830
hat 2003 is my first chalk and it's been

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,440
a privilege to be part of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to observe the interesting changes</font>

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know one of the major changes</font>

26
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,780
that's happened is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy world</font>

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,770
and the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> world have become</font>

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,390
increasingly interested in the security

29
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,630
issues that this community has been

30
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,550
thinking about talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

31
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:48,020
researching for 20-plus years now but as

32
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:52,490
you know from specially living in the DC

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:55,848
area cyber is the cat's pajamas and the

34
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,580
hotness of the last few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and and</font>

35
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,500
it's partially because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

36
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,950
might be called kind of moral panic

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,080
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> security that I've opted for the</font>

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,119
stylistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice of Comic Sans for this</font>

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,919

40
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:15,530
bit of critical distance from the issues

41
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:19,369
and so this is really a critique of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

42
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,959
conversation from an outsider's view not

43
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,260
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this community but about the</font>

44
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,660
dynamic between my world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy and</font>

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">law and the research that's going on</font>

46
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,020
and the other piece of this that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

47
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,940
should share with you apart from having

48
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the privilege of talking to groups like</font>

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,140
this and legal groups I started my

50
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,100
career as a corporate lawyer in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90s</font>

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,239
representing tech startups and

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,570
multinationals as well as they tried to

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,210
first engage with the emerging body of

54
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,290
law in the late 90s around the internet

55
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,060
and it was a wild and<font color="#CCCCCC"> woolly time some</font>

56
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,850
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conflicts we've never resolved</font>

57
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,830
and that's part of what's making the

58
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,049
conversation around security today<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

59
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,150
challenging from a legal standpoint and

60
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other item that I'll tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

61
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,510
about myself so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have a sense of</font>

62
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,850
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> my perspectives coming from I</font>

63
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,130
served as the Federal Trade Commission

64
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,980
senior policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisor on security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

65
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,200
privacy for a year and so that gave me

66
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,829
the privilege of interacting with some

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,810
of the enforcers as well and as many of

68
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you undoubtedly know the FTC is probably</font>

69
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,690
the leading agency<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's most engaged</font>

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,380
with security enforcement to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> extent</font>

71
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,180
that an FTC<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commissioner is going to</font>

72
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,359
defcon for the third year in a row this

73
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,340
year and the FTC has even run contests

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,860
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON so that is a very high level</font>

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of engagement for a federal agency and</font>

76
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,540
so it's with that backdrop that I'd like

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share some thoughts with you about</font>

78
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,230
the way that the security conversation

79
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,250
is happening and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my plea for</font>

80
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,600
leadership from this Community and

81
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:06,180
definitional specificity and in

82
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,350
self-governing standards to help guide

83
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policymakers in a collaborative way</font>

84
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:17,100
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys that</font>

85
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,459
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> our ecosystem is still</font>

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,820
rife with vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> zand the things</font>

87
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,919
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only becoming more dramatic in many</font>

88
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,480
ways so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just at privacy law</font>

89
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,460
scholars in DC there's a law professor

90
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,040
conference going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at the same time and</font>

91
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,260
yesterday I presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> a draft paper of</font>

92
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,820
mine called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of bodies and</font>

93
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:42,849
i introduced the ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the extent</font>

94
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,140
of medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices and other enhancement</font>

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,450
devices that are being connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">body and through bluetooth and through</font>

97
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:55,030
the internet cetera exposing consumers

98
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,349
people to new security risks and how

99
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,909
that interplays with our traditional

100
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,310
legal frameworks you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> punch line</font>

101
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,490
poorly right there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot to be done</font>

102
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,170
but bringing in that medical device

103
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,710
vulnerability conversation that has been

104
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,050
robust in this community forever into a

105
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,989
different audience that's part of the

106
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:18,370
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we face the grand we as</font>

107
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:21,010
we nudge this whole security bundle of

108
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,230
issues forward and so when I give this

109
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,510
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to legal audiences I use this</font>

110
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,310
slide to bring them into the fold of it

111
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:33,580
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce two movies i introduce</font>

112
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,310
the interview of course and talk with

113
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,370
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can try to connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them</font>

114
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:42,940
with respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the conversation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

115
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,780
attribution for that series of incidents

116
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,910
the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about good</font>

117
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,049
vulnerability practices on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sony end</font>

118
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:56,260
as well and how those two play together

119
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,690
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also tell them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

120
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,890
the movie black hat which fewer of them

121
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:06,430
have seen but nevertheless<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned</font>

122
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,140
that there was a group of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

123
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,030
shmoocon where I happen to be when black

124
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,590
hat was premiering<font color="#CCCCCC"> it went to see the</font>

125
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,719
movie and so I share some of the

126
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,119
observations of that audience and part

127
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,830
of the challenge for me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for</font>

128
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,920
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us is to create those</font>

129
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:25,240
communication bridges so with that let

130
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,650
me take you to kind of the next step in

131
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,600
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll only speak</font>

132
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,979
for about 30 minutes and I really would

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,280
prefer to open it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to questions that</font>

134
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,290
we engage together on this so basically

135
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,539
legally speaking there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two dominant</font>

136
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,090
legal paradigms that are pervading the

137
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,340
DC conversation from my perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

138
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,739
first is information sharing which is

139
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,479
useful but as you all know we still

140
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,120
have some building blocks that are

141
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">missing to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to construct the</font>

142
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,940
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> around information sharing</font>

143
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,560
in a robust way<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the experts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

144

audience are in a better position<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

145
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,979

emerging new categories of threats those

kinds of scaling and other challenges

false perception that just information

sharing on existing things as people are

163
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,460
compromised is somehow enough we all

<font color="#E5E5E5">the metrics that we still need to build</font>

169
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,569
to a greater extent and why we need

170
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:17,520
government funding and help in

171
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,630

organizational collaborative

173
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,690
relationships as a precursor to

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,550
information sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something</font>

175
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,500
we're currently missing the second

176
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,399
paradigm is deterrence and this is

177
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,309
old-school criminal law criminal law is

178
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,559
predicated perhaps on more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than any</font>

179
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,078
other paradigm<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notion of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deterrence</font>

180
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,728
so every first-year law student will

181
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:45,989
tell you there are for purposes of

182
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:48,060
criminal law<font color="#E5E5E5"> and depending on with whom</font>

183
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,180
you speak you'll get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind of</font>

184
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,359
supremacy of which of these purposes is

185
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,120
most integral to the functionality of

186
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,850
our society so deterrence obviously is

187
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,880
the idea of scaring people into not

188
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,519
doing the thing that you're identifying

189
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,610
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also values in some</font>

190
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,259
criminal laws in non-internet contexts

191
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,630

construct of the rules and to help them

197
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,350
evolve to conform their conduct to the

198
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">rules right now with respect to security</font>

199
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,889
we have the attempt of the deterrence

200
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,729
paradigm being supreme so when you look

201
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,529
at the conversations around hacker

202
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,600
prosecutions we have the rhetoric of

203
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:47,850
deterrence happening but as we know

204
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,829
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a square peg</font>

205
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,319
round hole because of the way that

206
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:55,439
security threads<font color="#E5E5E5"> emerge in the way that</font>

207
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:57,389
information criminality happens and so

208
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that framing is also presenting a</font>

209
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:03,500
challenge because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that different</font>

210
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:06,300
agencies are approaching security is

211
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,240
varying partially because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

212
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,160
paradigm that's being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,720
used and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to deterrence and</font>

214
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:18,269
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit more about this</font>

215
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,600
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to flesh this out I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

216
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:24,839
identify for flaws that I see in the

217
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,040
conversation around policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security</font>

218
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,439
and the goal here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to share these</font>

219
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,040
observations with you partially to help

220
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:36,719
you as technical experts in this area

221
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,699
engage meaningfully with people who are

222
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,600
not technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> experts in this area and</font>

223
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:44,910
to connect with some of what lives in

224
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,279
their head or they've read or they've

225
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:54,660
seen around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security</font>

226
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:57,600
so the first flaw is the fault of my

227
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,750
world so particularly among lawyers and

228
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,850
among law professors the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> flood all</font>

229
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:08,329
identify is something i call privacy

230
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:11,070
conflation the field of cyber law as

231
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:14,160
internet law was called in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine</font>

232
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:17,330
es was followed up in popularity by

233
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,120
privacy laws so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet privacy law</font>

234
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:26,970
security with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception of a few of</font>

235
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:29,460
us who kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> were may be ahead of the</font>

236
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,720
game<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fun of hanging out</font>

237
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,060
with you guys are learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you guys</font>

238
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,430
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception of a few weirdos like</font>

239
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,319
me at the majority of law professors who

240
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,569
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security now came to it</font>

241
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,230
through intellectual property law or

242
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:46,370
through privacy law and so as a result

243
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:50,690
the default framing for many of them is

244
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:55,070
trying to frame security as some

245
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:59,400
subfield subsection how it relates to

246
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:03,420
privacy but that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fit security is</font>

247
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,579
a different thing so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that I try</font>

248
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to draw this line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's what this</font>

249
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">paper is primarily doing is to try to</font>

250
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,100
articulate some of the division that

251
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,320
exists within<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer science so in</font>

252
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,760
privacy and even if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

253
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,610
way privacy policies are constructed

254
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,710
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about individual</font>

255
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-to-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships where people</font>

are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transmit information in</font>

257
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,560
the way that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular individual</font>

258
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">wants to another particular individual</font>

259
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,810
endpoint so it's about the relationship

260
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,200
of individuals to the information

261
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">transit and each other security as I</font>

264
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,770

privacy policy may be negotiated mushy

266
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,960

<font color="#E5E5E5">company and the consumers for example</font>

270
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:08,459
available or it is not now we can talk

271
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:12,140
about the degrees of acceptable problems

272
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:15,270
in security but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the</font>

273
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,750
objectively testable reality of whether

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> as whether a system and code</font>

possesses these characteristics that

276
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,220
demonstrate state-of-the-art security is

277
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,370
objectively testable proposition by

278
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,740
third parties privacy questions or not

279
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,560
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> inherently situated within a</font>

280
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,350
social conversation construct and

281
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,469
contract security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

282
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,940
and by splitting those apart we can

283
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,070
start to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more robust</font>

284
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,540
conversation on a policy level with

perhaps this field is somehow

contrary<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the way that attackers work</font>

354

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,290
it's all embedded within a bigger

387
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,620
would be bacon in this talk here's the

388
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">bacon so and many of you are undoubtedly</font>

391
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:39,700
of the challenge in the conversation is

392
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,380
that sometimes there's a presumption

393
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,200
that more technology is better

394
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,940
technology that the shiny or the gadget

395
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,809
the more buttons there are to push the

396
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:52,600
more complicated the code the newer more

397

398
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,510
this technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

399
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:01,000
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really take a step back</font>

400
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and realize that that's not always the</font>

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,210
case and and it's important for

402
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,030
policymakers and to help policymakers

403
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,549
recognize this so the same way that

404
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,889
while for a highly carnivorous

405
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,620

of bacon on top of your meal may be a

408
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:26,559
joyful bonus but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say that that</font>

409
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:28,658
eater is a vegetarian who chose that

410
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,539
meal specifically because there was no

411
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:33,789
disclosed bacon on it right so it's a

412
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,440
question of whether the technology is

413
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:38,379
optimally suited for the purpose for

414

00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of shifted paradigm that I'm sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

440
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:50,529
into law world and policy world and

441
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,149
maybe it'll resonate with someone I hope

442
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:54,009
it'll resonate with someone but it's a

443
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:56,889
bit of a refrain from what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

444
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:59,710
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so I call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this approach a new</font>

445
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:05,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">security paradigm of reciprocal security</font>

446
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:07,629
inducement so this approach from my

447
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,429
standpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was in town I</font>

448
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:13,509
encountered the philosophy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and science</font>

449
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:17,529
theory of this philosopher of science

450
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:20,739
who was also a scientist himself and he

451
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:22,509
was sort of a multi-talented guy though

452
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:24,909
his older brother is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more famous than he</font>

453
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:26,559
is his older brother as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Karl Polanyi but</font>

454
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,960
this is Michael Polanyi and Michael

455
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,259
Polanyi wrote a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really</font>

456
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting texts about how to help</font>

457
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,669
scientific advancement intersect and

458
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,980
function within social constructs and

459
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:40,960
legal construct with economic concerns

460
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:46,649
so he tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create frameworks that</font>

461
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:52,899
blended all of these dynamics so from

00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:55,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">palani the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take away is there</font>

463
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:57,668
are a few a few sub points so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

464
00:21:55,269 --> 00:22:02,399
is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> palani this is all like working</font>

465
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:05,139
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 piece puzzle in a team</font>

466
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:08,018
you're not creating a hierarchy of

467
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:10,299
conduct you're creating a group of

468
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:13,650
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working together in a</font>

469
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,870
loosely coordinated manner each

470
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,490
piece of that puzzle each group of

471
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:21,090
pieces each section that's being worked

472
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:23,760
on is needed for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> completion of this</font>

473
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,490
puzzle and if one group Falls

474
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,810
dramatically behind the puzzle is not

475
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,690

476
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,790
done wrong so what needs to happen is

477
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,740
that each as each group works on each

478
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,860
corner of this puzzle they need to

479
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,450
loosely coordinate across groups to make

480
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,790
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is working together</font>

481
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:48,630
as a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he used this kind of a</font>

482
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:51,090
multi-faceted problem as the typical

483
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,970
kind of structure that we see in

484
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:57,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated science technology economic</font>

485
00:22:53,970 --> 00:23:00,180
interwoven problems so that's point one

486
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,460
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a giant puzzle where we</font>

487
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,530
need to help loosely coordinate help

488
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,550
each other to get all of the corners

489
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:11,190
built correctly now the second piece

490
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:15,210
that he highlights in particular because

491
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:18,980
he paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to judges and lawyers</font>

492

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> his scholarship and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">memory source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what he highlighted</font>

495
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,260
was that Tecna both technical

496

communities and legal communities have

497
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,970
deep structures of tacit knowledge

498
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,149
implicit communications structures

499
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:46,680
definitions terms that they understand

among each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> within their group but</font>

that a lost in translation feature can

happen across those groups because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

knowledge communities of lawyers versus

technologists for example have different

505
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:06,030
structures of tacit knowledge if you've

506
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:09,110
ever heard a two first-year law students

507
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,670
geeking out about Civil Procedure jokes

508
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,290
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> special you'll you'll know</font>

509
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,050
what I mean right<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're referencing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">obscure rules with obscure twists and</font>

511
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,430
making an inside joke about some case

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:23,490
you know if for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if I throw out</font>

the word<font color="#CCCCCC"> pennoyer it would you know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

randomly throughout that world<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word in</font>

515
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,200
the middle of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot talk I would</font>

516
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,610
I would make the whole room kind of look

517
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,370
at me like what and then burst out into

518
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:36,070
hysterics but but that's a it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

519
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,139
inside reference right the same way that

520
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,659
in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a common language</font>

521
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,700
and so trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bridge those tacit</font>

522
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,680
knowledge gaps that's part of the

523
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,770
challenge of the puzzle building so

524
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:51,540
those two notions let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that from</font>

525
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:55,720
Hawaii the third one is just a simple

526
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:58,389
paradigm shift in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of viewing the</font>

527
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,130
adversaries perspective versus your own

528
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,660
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this community this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

529
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,070
no-brainer obviously you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

530
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,470
adversary it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way you can</font>

531
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:07,810
anticipate right but this is something

532
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,510
that's novel to people who are outside

533
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:13,450
this community because they're not used

534
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,820
to necessarily putting themselves in the

535
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,350
position of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the adversary in the way</font>

536
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,889
that they're building their structures

537
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:24,459
they're optimistic and hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the best</font>

538
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:26,560
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone plays nicely kumbaya but</font>

539
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,380
as we know that's unfortunately not the

540
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,120
world we live in so one way to think

541
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,890
about this the Monty Hall problem is

542
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure most of you know it it's this</font>

543
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,850
thought experiment where there's Monty

544
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,690
Hall who was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game show</font>

545
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:42,850
host and you're asked to pick one of

546
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,380
three doors and behind one of the doors

547
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,270
as a car behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other two doors</font>

548
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,540
there are goats no you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> foot knows</font>

549
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:51,010
this assumes that you want the car more

550
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">than you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go which wouldn't</font>

551
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,940
necessarily be true for me but let's not

552
00:25:52,750 --> 00:26:01,990
go there so let's assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want the</font>

553
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:04,900
car so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pick well you pick your door</font>

554
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,930
and then money reveals one of the goats

555
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:12,880
and then money gives you the chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

556
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:14,440
change your door so for most people they

557
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">think well you can change you could not</font>

558
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,070
change its 5050 but the map indicates

559
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,379
that that's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in fact</font>

560
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:25,510
you should absolutely change so the math

561
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:27,910
there is very it's a trust oriented

562
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:31,570
exercise especially for<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy people in</font>

563
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:36,659
lawyers so for me another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

564
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:40,080
about this and to help reframe the

565
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,549
a view into an adversarial mindset which

566
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,189
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we obviously need for</font>

567
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:49,429
security is to help people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

568
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:53,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Monty's perspective so money is</font>

569
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:56,039
choosing to reveal a door knowing which

570
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,789
door you picked and knowing where the

571
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:03,389
car is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monty is an Oracle and Monty</font>

572
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:06,809
may not necessarily but may be steering

573
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:09,389
you away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the door that has the car</font>

574
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:11,849
so Monty may be transmitting additional

575
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:14,008
information and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case then</font>

576
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:16,289
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should switch doors right</font>

577
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,720
so by viewing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exchange for Monty's</font>

578
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:21,269
perspective instead of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> contestants</font>

579
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,889
the world looks different and so it's

580
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:24,690
that adversarial<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective taking</font>

581
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:29,389
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that policy has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

582
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:33,989
always engaged with the last point

583
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:37,439
undoubtedly you've you remember and

584
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:39,529
still encounter instances where members

585
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of Congress might say bring in the Nerds</font>

586
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:46,889
or you know get a nerd consult and and

587
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:49,379
so a small group of technologists will

588
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:53,928
be brought in and they'll be heard out

589
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:58,709
and then they may or may not be ignored

590
00:27:53,929 --> 00:28:03,239
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pieces that's critical to</font>

591
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:07,049
this puzzle is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> policy</font>

592
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:09,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">makers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to embrace the realities of the</font>

593
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:12,840
scientific<font color="#E5E5E5"> community for insecurity but</font>

594
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:15,330
also the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> way around to help from</font>

595
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,988
the perspective of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policymakers for</font>

596
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:21,960
the security expert community to know

597
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:24,479
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy makers are coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

598
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,450
and help to build those bridges in a

599
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:30,139
shared discourse and recognizing that

600
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:32,509
each group has tacit knowledge that is

601
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:35,189
equally valid but very different and

602
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:40,679
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be harmonized in order to move</font>

603
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:42,389
forward ok so the punchline of the

604
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,690
reciprocal security inducement paradigm

605
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:48,740
is precisely this kind of a

606
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:52,100
self-reinforcing virtuous circle

607
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,980
security is ultimately not that

608
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,000
dissimilar across the private sector in

609
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,830
the public sector right there are

610
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,480
security basics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in place</font>

611
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,760
regardless of whether you're a public or

612
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,460
private sector entity highlighting those

613
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,379
security basics and making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

614
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:11,200
OPM breach doesn't happen again for

615
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:15,770
example or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a Sony breach is</font>

618
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,320
right so helping to create a

619
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,780
conversation and across both the public

620
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,000
and private sector of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the underpinnings</font>

621
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,490
of what good security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way that's</font>

622
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,340
mutually understandable and everyone's

on the same page<font color="#E5E5E5"> technically speaking</font>

624
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:41,199

that actually work and so the point is

<font color="#CCCCCC">to help induce in practice good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

all as one big puzzle and cooperative

coordination while working independently

634
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:12,500
helps us potentially to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

635
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,050
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the current information</font>

reframe this as building a security

vigilance infrastructure think about

639

those underpinnings those building

get meaningful metrics in place to help

about precise security challenges that

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:40,580
exist with the ability to determine what

645
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,340
really is a more serious challenge but

646
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,530
for example when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have large portions</font>

Batman we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem right we have</font>

problems on the ground that are plainly

obvious to this community but helping to

identify those absent building blocks is

662

something that I would ask you guys to
