1
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:27,650
okay well thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming it looks</font>

2
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we'd probably split about half and</font>

3
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:35,149
half between this one and the and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

4
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:37,760
other session over there you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

5
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:41,660
a cloud expert you're probably not going

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,089
to learn a whole lot today but most of

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">my time these days is talking with CEOs</font>

8
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:49,309
and CIOs and board members about this

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,399
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the cloud that they have</font>

10
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:54,890
they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no idea what that means</font>

11
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,149
it's just a five letter word to them

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:02,210
that they're spending a lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

13
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:05,660
so I try to take this you know raise the

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,340
conversation up a little bit and we'll

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,270
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and end a little</font>

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of detail here but really my when I</font>

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,860
try to have this conversation it is

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,910
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud whether you</font>

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,410
realize it or not so buckle up and and I

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,360
just kind of walk through<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

21
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,158
reasons why so from a business

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,900
perspective and from a technical

23
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,890
perspective why it's important to them

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:34,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actually there's a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CIS OS</font>

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:40,399
that don't get as well that don't

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:45,220
recognize the inability of the cloud so

27
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:49,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll start with a little bit of humor</font>

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:55,219
this is mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> Weatherford notice the</font>

29
00:01:49,759 --> 00:02:00,290
resemblance this mark Weatherford was

30
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:03,199
arrested in 2006 for building a bomb to

31
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:07,700
blow up his<font color="#CCCCCC"> City Hall at some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,970
town in Minnesota at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I was</font>

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,120
traveling a lot and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine the</font>

34
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,150
fun TSA had with me every time I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,310
an airport because for some reason my

36
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,489
name got flagged and and I got the

37
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,870
special treatment<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it died away and</font>

38
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:28,110
then about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a month ago I got pulled</font>

39
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,230
aside again and

40
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,420
and ran through the drill and and I've

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,549
had been stopped three times in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,799
month I'm like what the heck is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,720
here this wasn't this was a decade<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,430
but anyway I just thought i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would throw</font>

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,690
it up there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of it's kind of</font>

46
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:55,590
interesting that you never<font color="#CCCCCC"> die on the</font>

47
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet so so in 2009</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was the CISO</font>

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,300
for the state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> california with</font>

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,050
Governor Schwarzenegger and I gave a

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,730
speech to all of the sis owes in the

51
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,500
state of California and state government

52
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,070
in California California<font color="#CCCCCC"> we added a</font>

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:15,180
hundred and sixty two boards commissions

54
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:17,519
departments agencies etc etc etc and

55
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,860
each of them have either a SISO or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,860
director of<font color="#CCCCCC"> security or something and I</font>

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,630
got all these folks in a room and I gave

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,780
a talk and one of the components of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

59
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,060
talk was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said this cloud thing is</font>

60
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a big deal and we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,230
we as security professionals need to be

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,000
paying attention to it because it's

63
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to impact our lives and our</font>

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,080
professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives and a couple of after</font>

65
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,200
my talk a couple of systems literally

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,120
ran I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually ready to hide duck</font>

67
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,980
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hide they ran up front and basically</font>

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,769
chastising me and said over my dead body

69
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,510
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of my data go into a cloud and</font>

70
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,160
so I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decade later or</font>

71
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,130
seven or eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> years later I'm</font>

72
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,079
vindicated and they were wrong but then

73
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,650
I saw this piece to this note here from

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,160
Andrew McAfee I in 2011 he<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

75
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:17,220
says that the switch from from to the

76
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,500
cloud is inevitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

77
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,989
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sets the landscape for</font>

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,910
where we are today with the cloud and

79
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,520
any of you going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the process</font>

80
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:30,690
today know what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,020
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is truly probably one of</font>

82
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,610
the biggest infrastructure

83
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,310
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've gone through in my</font>

84
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifetime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this all</font>

85
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:45,289
my life been in this business so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

86
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:47,750
then in in December Cisco put out their

87
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:49,639
cloud index survey and it said<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighteen</font>

88
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">eighty six percent of all workloads</font>

89
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,099
would be processed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the cloud in by</font>

90
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,289
2019 that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal not a</font>

91
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:59,210
granted Cisco probably has a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> skin</font>

92
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:04,568
in the game there so the number may be

93
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:07,849
skewed a little bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it's</font>

94
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:10,849
only partially right that's a big ding

95
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:13,520
deal it's a big dang deal when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

96
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:19,580
about where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are today when we have we</font>

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,979
think about our our our our data centers

98
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,280
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> purim data centers that are you know</font>

99
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:26,840
still racked and stacked with physical

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,210
servers that are moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the virtual</font>

101
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,409
environment this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

102
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:36,169
deal and because of that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

103
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier the whole the IT world is</font>

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,039
shifting<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this physical</font>

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,020
infrastructure to a digital and software

106
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,800
to find infrastructure and it's having

107
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">tremendous tremendous impact on what the</font>

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,300
court at core infrastructure of our data

109
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:57,289
centers in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud are back in 1998</font>

110
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,050
VMware came on on the scene with a with

111
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:04,180
a virtualized product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then over the</font>

112
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">years we've seen that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> migrate from from</font>

113
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,380
compute to storage the networking and

114
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,319
now security security is the next piece

115
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,830
of software defined everything there's a

116
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,020
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of unbelievable products coming out</font>

117
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,859
that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of unbelievable research</font>

118
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,419
being done at various places around the

119
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:31,099
world that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine in my</font>

120
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind what the the cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to look</font>

121
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:36,979
like in five years but good<font color="#E5E5E5"> news for us</font>

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,009
security is going to be a big part of

123
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:42,620
that I think the cloud gives us an

124
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:45,229
opportunity and I'll talk a little bit

125
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,980
more later about why i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud</font>

126
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:51,969
can be

127
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:55,370
for better security for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us so as</font>

128
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with even though I'm with a</font>

129
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,050
with a product company now spent the

130
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,320
last several years as a consultant

131
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,450
working with Fortune 100 s and the thing

132
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,000
that became obvious to me more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

133
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,610
anything else is you know Marc

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,890
Andreessen said it back in 2011 the

135
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:16,220
software is eating the world but the

136
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:19,159
reality is is that every industry is

137
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,710
being affected by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud today being</font>

138
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,030
affected by technology today and I

139
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,440
challenge anybody to think of an

140
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:33,080
industry that is not being

141
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,330
revolutionized by not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> by technology</font>

142
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,669
but by the services<font color="#CCCCCC"> and opportunities of</font>

143
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:46,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cloud I think one of the greatest</font>

144
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:48,860
set the sector having having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a impact</font>

145
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,950
that you may not recognize is

146
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,670
agriculture and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you know</font>

147
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:59,690
from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> irrigation to livestock and</font>

148
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:03,430
farming to fertilizing to growing stuff

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean the cloud is is revolutionising</font>

150
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,720
agriculture but it's revolutionising

151
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,170
everything else to manufacturing

152
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,580
certainly automobiles everything is

153
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,350
being impacted by the cloud and we're

154
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,260
seeing this transition now this is

155
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:24,010
another by the way if anybody has not

156
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,300
seen this Wikibon<font color="#E5E5E5"> North grid ventures</font>

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixty two slides and it is unbelievable</font>

159
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,590
a bit of data in there but talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

160
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">public versus hybrid cloud strategies</font>

161
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,330
use of public clouds up forty three

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,120
percent use of hybrid cloud up nineteen

163
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,040
percent use of private clouds down

164
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,500
forty-eight percent as actually

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,990
surprised by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last number there I</font>

166
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,790
think it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue go down but</font>

167
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,370
the number is down a lot farther<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I</font>

168
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,370
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is just since 2011</font>

169
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:03,910
obviously SAS is the most deployed cloud

170
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,069
service and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the growth</font>

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,870
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the projected growth of this</font>

172
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:12,340
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is mind-boggling this is why not</font>

173
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,170
just from a technology and from a

174
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,220
security perspective but from a business

175
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,930
perspective CEOs and boards are

176
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,330
absolutely paying attention to what's

177
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening with the cloud because this is</font>

178
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,830
changing the way they're spending money

179
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,020
this is changing the way their their

180
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,780
capital expenditures for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs. their</font>

181
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,410
operational expenditures are happening

182
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,670
every year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're a SISO and i'll</font>

183
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,520
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this in a minute if you're a</font>

SISO you are having this conversation

185
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,890
with your CEO today probably certainly I

186
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,760
guarantee if you're a fortune 500<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so</font>

187
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,560
you're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> this conversation itn</font>

188
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,710
business operations are moving to the

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,449
cloud eighty-five percent of web content

management eighty-two percent of

191
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,480
communications etc etc etc I really get

192
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,209
excited about the business part of this

193
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,700

everything is moving to the cloud and

198
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:21,069
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that the reason is</font>

199
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:25,360
that it's more efficient and it's less

200

about the tail of that I have to worry

about the maintenance I have to worry

about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> training of my people I have</font>

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,080
to worry about the contracts going to

come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> again next year and if I move if</font>

211
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,140
I take advantage of the cloud I by the

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,439
same service in the cloud I can adjust I

213

can I can if I if I have greater demand

in different periods of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the year I can</font>

buy more by less I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

216
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,860
have to worry about training

217
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:16,470
people to at least to the level that

218
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:19,600
that I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> too if I owned the the</font>

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">capacity that you need and we're talking</font>

221
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:28,300
about insurance cyber security insurance

222
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:31,210
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier with someone i can</font>

223
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,339
transfer some of my risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't</font>

224
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,800
ramp not not all of my risk and I can't

225
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,660
transfer but the responsibility but i

226
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,140
can transfer some of my risk to the

227
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:46,689
cloud provider when i move my services

228
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:48,160
to the cloud so we live today in this

229
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,100
multi-cloud world and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

230
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,050
we're ever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get away from from</font>

231
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this multi cloud environment you know</font>

232
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've moved away basically from from a</font>

233
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,450
physical opera physical data center with

234
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,580
physical servers and racks and racks as

235
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:07,600
far as you can see if servers and we

236
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,100
moved gone through this transition for

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,140
the virtual and cloud in this

238
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,360
multi-cloud world where your

239
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:19,540
organization your everybody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

240
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain I believe some capacity on prim</font>

241
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,990
I mean you're never going to move

242
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,910
everything to the cloud that's not true

243
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,440
there are some small companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

244
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,490
don't know anything they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't they</font>

245
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,460
don't have a date<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have a</font>

246
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,140
closet any longer everything is done in

247
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the club but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for most companies i think</font>

248
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,810
certainly for larger companies you're

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,750
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain some presence on site</font>

250
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,660
we're gonna have stuff in amazon we have

251
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,570
stuff in azure gonna have stuff at

252
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">centurylink or wherever it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be so</font>

253
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,780
the ability to manage your security

254
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,950
across this multi cloud environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

255
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,250
think is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great challenges</font>

256
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:59,790
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> today or as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wendy says one</font>

257
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,890
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great opportunities we have today</font>

258
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,120
by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

259
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to steal that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

260
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,790
talk tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that much</font>

261
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,980
so but is it safe so you may remember

262
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,930
this movie some of you may remember this

263
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:18,000
movie marathon man dustin hoffman and

264
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,849
and Laurence Olivier this is Laurence

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,060
Olivier he was this doctor<font color="#CCCCCC"> he does</font>

266
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,399
anybody see this movie least a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

267
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:31,589
you so no watch it it's it's a good move

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:33,660
it Laurence Olivier wants to know what

269
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,200
Dustin Hoffman knows so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps saying</font>

270
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,569
is it safe and Dustin Hoffman says I

271
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,990
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is it safe I don't know so he</font>

272
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,000
drills a hole in his tooth and he says

273
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,339
is it safe he goes yes it's safe he

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,600
drops another hole is it safe no it's

275
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,190
not safety drills know the whole he's

276
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,440
like what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want me to say he</font>

277
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,420
drills another hole and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

278
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you know the security we feel</font>

279
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,939
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sometimes is it safe you know</font>

280
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:01,680
if you're a SISO or anybody that's in

281
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,589
the security business<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody has asked</font>

282
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,319
you at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point in your life is it</font>

283
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,589
safe today are we safe are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

284
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,540
have we<font color="#CCCCCC"> done everything we need to do</font>

285
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,180
well everyone knows if that's an

286
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,339
unanswerable question because we can

287
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,779
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more we think we've done</font>

288
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:24,180

point is it safe that I'll never move my

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,870
opportunity is so you know we've been

294
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying this for several years now that</font>

295
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,270
the perimeter is dead long live the

296

303
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,290
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> because technology has moved</font>

304
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,209
on really quickly we have a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

305
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,540
stuff happening within our environment

306

now and without<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside our environment</font>

307
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,079
that impact the ability of a perimeter

308
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,490
to try to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that level of</font>

caption that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we used to depend on it for</font>

310
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,710
so this 8020 rule I think is really

311
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">important for us and the 8020 rule</font>

312
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:33,870
basically says that about twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

313
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,360
of the traffic in a virtual environment

314
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,370
whether to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> on-prem data center or</font>

315
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,130
your cloud twenty percent of the traffic

316
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,140
actually flows north and south flows

317
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,380
through that that vertical stack of

318
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:50,100
security products what that means is

319
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,640
that eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traffic is</font>

320
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,640
flowing east and<font color="#CCCCCC"> west</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and guess what</font>

321
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,920
you're not seeing it most of you are not

324

325

east-west traffic right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

326
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,500
should make everyone very uncomfortable

327
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,940
because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of stuff that</font>

328
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:19,650
happened you know we've seen some some

329
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:21,900
some examples of this where when

330
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,319
companies get the opportunity to see

331
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,300
this this east-west traffic most of them

332
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,080
on to pass out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so much</font>

333
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,540
stuff going on so there's users talking

334
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,540
to two applications talking to databases

335
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,280
that have no idea or no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason or</font>

336
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:43,290
rationale for why they should be doing

337
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:45,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so security challenges and</font>

338
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:49,160
opportunities I like this term

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:53,010
challenges and opportunities so

340
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,199

some decisions on how do we how do we

overlooked problem that we have a

security professionals and if I took a

370
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,100
survey I'm pretty confident that most of

371
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,760
you would would agree with that it

continues to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one issue that we</font>

necessary thoroughly malicious insiders

375
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,280
but there's a lot of naive and ignorant

a mouse and then it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to look</font>

from an affinity perspective to look

to take instant response from weeks or

months down to minutes or hours in some

become a greater problem for us as as

00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:22,019
the availability and the ubiquitous

451
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:23,668
pneus of the clouds continue to grow so

452
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:28,590
one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversations i</font>

453
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:30,629
have is and i would love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to take a</font>

454
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,209
survey of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience and see who's had</font>

455
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:37,678
this conversation about the cloud people

456
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:40,619
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i have just bought AWS</font>

457
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,759
and they are taking care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all my</font>

458
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:46,820
security problems now so I wash my hands

459
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,909
of it I have no more security

460
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,710
responsibilities so my when I want to

461
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:54,239
hear somebody say that my kind of line

462
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,190
of quit of my line of thinking goes

463
00:22:54,239 --> 00:23:01,369
along lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

464
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:04,529
virus whose responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that and</font>

465
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:06,720
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think well that must be Amazon's</font>

466
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:08,909
responsibility no that's your

467
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,409
responsibility if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a rogue</font>

468
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:13,710
employee that starts doing something

469
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,419
whose responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it's not</font>

470
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amazon's responsible that's your</font>

471
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,470
responsibility as well so you start

472
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,168
getting that and you then you eat it

473
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,629
when you think of this all of this stuff

474
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:27,239
up here this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you are responsible</font>

475
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:28,590
for I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what I said earlier you</font>

476
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,419
can outsource some of the

477
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot outsource</font>

478
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,379
all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibilities and quite</font>

479
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:37,460
frankly you don't want to outsource all

480
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibilities</font>

481
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,630
so the cloud of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the catalyst I really</font>

482
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,240
believe this this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">most important reason why the cloud is</font>

that the economic advantages of the

495
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,590
economics like that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,879
take you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that there's way more</font>

499
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,639
than that the cloud provides anytime

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,900
anywhere access high reliability

501
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:46,370
automatic backups there's a case to be

502
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:49,520
made for this with the the wave<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

503
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:54,649
ransomware that's been occurring that if

504
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,590
you can disassociate your backups from

505
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,910
your internal environment that it's

506
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably something you should be</font>

considering you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

talk about too much about I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

are in big big trouble the bottom one

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,100
here is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the point I</font>

514
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,080
think that many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us have been making</font>

515
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,059
for several years though and that is

516
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:27,040
cloud providers are highly incentivized

517
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:31,490
to look to deliver security they have to

518
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,250
AWS<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft any of the cloud service</font>

519
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:38,179
providers they cannot afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a</font>

520
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,790
security event it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is devastating to</font>

521
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:42,620
their business people would flee their

522
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:47,580
business and some of you know Dave

decade ago that he said when they have a

security event as Washington Mutual they

527
00:25:56,979 --> 00:26:01,720
would lose twenty five percent of their

predict you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">same kind of challenge with with the</font>

clouds you know if think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font>

532
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,909
the impact of a security event on AWS

533
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,679
holy cow it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just impact one</font>

534
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:20,619
person there it could impact you know

535
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,989
millions and millions of company so I

536
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:25,478
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably the most</font>

537
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:29,859
important piece of the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us is</font>

538
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:32,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that while we still want to pay</font>

540
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,389
providers have to do they have to

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide a higher level of security and</font>

542
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:41,709
again it's not because we assist those

543
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,228
and security professionals don't want to

544
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,659
and don't know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do we</font>

00:26:51,669 --> 00:27:00,489
incentivized to efficiently deploy those

549
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:01,989
resources so people ask and I didn't

550
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:03,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this up you know this so i just</font>

551
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:06,009
found this you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and search on</font>

560
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:34,570
I've learned is vendors do not get

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">better after you sign a contract if they</font>

suck before you sign the contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

563
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:42,269
as good as it's ever going to get and

564
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:45,399
cloud service providers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way</font>

you have got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ask</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right kinds of questions I can</font>

567
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,309
remember you know five or six years ago

00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:54,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">going in and asking very fundamental</font>

well why would I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

I make you my vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of choice then if I</font>

they again just like we were talking

577
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,320
earlier about these exclusions in cyber

578

581
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,200
answer and after you sign the contract

582
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,850
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to live with it then so again</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to go through these you</font>

584
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:33,649
can go google it and you can find you

588
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,159
about this the you it's not just even

589
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:51,160
with AWS you want to know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

590
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:53,630
buying before you sign the<font color="#CCCCCC"> contract so</font>

591
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,860
I'm gonna change speeds for just the

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,840
top 20 critical controls let me ask that

594
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">differently has anybody not heard of the</font>

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,919
top 20 critical controls thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> God okay</font>

596
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:13,700
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about the top 20</font>

597
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,240
critical controls other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say this</font>

598
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">let me haces is anybody know any company</font>

599
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,700
that has successfully deployed all top

600
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:26,990
20 critical controls and maintain

601
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:32,090
compliance with all top 20 good I don't

602
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:33,650
either I worked in some free significant

603
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,050
organizations even in the federal

604
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:42,530
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I couldn't ever say this</font>

605
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:45,110
so so with that as a backdrop has

606
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:48,950
anybody seen this does anybody have to

607
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:52,729
do business<font color="#E5E5E5"> in California you're lucky</font>

608
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,320
so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay two months ago the</font>

609
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,600
California Attorney General put this

610
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,360
report<font color="#CCCCCC"> out data breach report everybody</font>

611
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">puts out data breaches ports right not a</font>

612
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,610
big deal it goes in it talks about it

613
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,139
talks about you know some of the events

614
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,439
that have happened in California over

615
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the past year etc etc etc but one of the</font>

616
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,309
things that

617
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,049
and this is what caught my attention

618
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,440
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why bring it up because I think</font>

619
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for everybody they made</font>

620
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,320
five recommendations and the first

621
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:24,710
recommendation is and I'm going to read

622
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,510
this because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's so important</font>

623
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,270
the first recommendation is the 20

624
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,910
controls in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIS critical security</font>

625
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,379
controls identify a minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of</font>

626
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,760
information security that all

627
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,730
organizations that collect or maintain

628
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,629
personal information should meet the

629
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,190
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the controls</font>

630
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,990
that apply to an organization's

631
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:50,520
environment constitute a lack of

632
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:55,080
reasonable security now I'm not an

633
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:56,970
attorney but if as a layman reading that

634
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,070
that looks to me like it says that if

635
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:02,220
you have not if you suffer a data breach

636
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:04,889
in California and in the course of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

637
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,630
answer response<font color="#CCCCCC"> in forensics and all the</font>

638
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,090
legal stuff that happens later on is

639
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,429
determined II did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all 20</font>

640
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:14,639
critical controls deployed you're

641
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:17,400
negligent and therefore subject to and

642
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:23,940
deserve all of the consequences<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

643
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:25,830
along with being negligent that's a bar

644
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,100
that we've all agreed nobody can beat

645
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:36,240
probably so so why do I put this up

646
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:42,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">there 2003's be 1386 anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember SP</font>

Commission for New Jersey passed

657

something similar to this for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> water</font>

the water control board and New Jersey

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start seeing more and</font>

660
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:24,899
more of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so my point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

661
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,129
this is the bar is being raised for us

662
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:31,830
the government is raising the bar for us

663
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:35,850
that as makes it really really hard for

664
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:44,040
us for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us our companies to live up to a</font>

bar this high<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay last slide I don't</font>

00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,110

667
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,000

668
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:55,020
because some of us are very very

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">parently but I don't think we're</font>

paranoid enough we're still we're still

00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,710
fighting yesterday's battles in many

672
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:09,409
cases I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the cloud gives us the</font>

673
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:13,140
opportunity to change the way our

674
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,640
organizations think about security and

675
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:20,240
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at you think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

676
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:23,010
that the the comment earlier about

677
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,100
Cisco's prediction of eighty-six percent

678

of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> compute will be deaf in the cloud</font>

679
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,580
by 2019 it gives us an opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

680
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:35,190
paranoid enough that we can begin

681
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,908
preparing our organizations for what's

682
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to happen by 2019 a lot of</font>

683
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:42,990
companies you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may they may</font>

684
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:46,729
skip the hybrid piece and just go

everything go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the cloud</font>

686
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,730
certainly a small company today there's

687
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,800
no reason to go and buy a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">servers and build your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own data center</font>

the box but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we're paranoid</font>

691
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:07,350
enough as a community to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to at this</font>

our CEOs and our boards wendy and i were

696
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:18,299
talking about this earlier you know

697
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,159
people always say you have a blank

698
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,990
cheque will fix everything well we all

699
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,090
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that blank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cheque is not</font>

700
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:24,609
really blank there's some number in

701
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,290
there some

702
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:31,420
but part of our job certainly as leaders

703
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:36,509
in the security community is to think

704
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what those numbers might be and</font>

705
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:41,260
often times you don't you don't get a

706
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,690
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time and a whole lot of</font>

resources to build with that budget or

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nirvana and</font>

709
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:50,110
security in your organization would be

710
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,909
but if you you approached us with that

711
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,720
paranoid mindset you're always thinking

712
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:58,180
about what tools what services what

713
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,029
products what kind of people what kind
