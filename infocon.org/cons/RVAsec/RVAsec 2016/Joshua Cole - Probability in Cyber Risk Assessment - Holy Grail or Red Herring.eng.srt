much for coming to hear me drone on

6
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,160
about probability in cyber risk

7
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:52,190
assessment actually this isn't me

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,569
droning on it really is it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

9
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,760
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit different and I'm going to</font>

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,920
confess<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to everyone that I'm</font>

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,869
incredibly nervous right now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,170
usually nervous doing these things

13
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:08,960
especially since I'm getting keep that

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:11,299
how do i do good<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so because</font>

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,020
this is a new way for me to actually do

16
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:18,560
we do a talk usually it's me standing up

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,439
here droning on for you know whatever

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time is with some with some Q&A at</font>

19
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:29,300
the end but this time I'm doing this a

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:33,740
little bit differently and I have and

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:36,860
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it a little bit more tenuous</font>

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,419
is that I have clients in here and I

23
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,860
have friends in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have friends</font>

24
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,770
that our clients and here in clients

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,380
that are friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here so that's the</font>

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing anyway so without further ado</font>

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,720
welcome everybody thank you for coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,260
do want to let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that this is</font>

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,170
actually a very interactive discussion

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,360
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like it's not a</font>

31
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,790
presentation this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a think of this is</font>

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,430
like a part of a feather session that

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go to at a conference we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully have some good discussion</font>

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,150
around this topic of probability in

36
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,069
cyber risk assessment so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here</font>

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:22,260
is that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

38
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,670
by death to powerpoint however i'm going

39
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,230
to i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a confession there</font>

40
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,629
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one slide in in this</font>

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,078
presentation that you're going to 84

42
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:34,530
because it is a horrible awful<font color="#E5E5E5"> i chart</font>

45
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that I thought there's some work is</font>

46
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:49,260
I'll give some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my perspective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

47
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">some what drove me to submit the idea</font>

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,858
for this paper into our be a set and

49
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,889
kind of set the stage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we sort</font>

50
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:00,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">of move into the discussion stage so</font>

51
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:01,889
please for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the love of god no that's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">wholly participate because if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear</font>

53
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:10,829
crickets out there you're going to see

54
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:13,709
me melt and it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty so we</font>

55
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,469
discuss and share your<font color="#CCCCCC"> experiences and</font>

56
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,139
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts with a group and we'll</font>

57
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:24,569
hopefully there are Austin Powers fans

58

out there feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to jump in though as</font>

59
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,439
i'm kind of going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the slides</font>

60
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,470
again this is interactive if you do have

61
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,470
questions

62
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:42,860
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually my favorite</font>

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,940
sketch ever this is that sketch so first

66
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:56,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have to do a disclaimer which is for</font>

my protection and yours these are solely

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,290
my opinions mine personally they don't

69
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,630
reflect my employer who you know I also

<font color="#CCCCCC">codes opinions there there nobody in in</font>

73
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,690
the rest of the Shura in fact we've had

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,360
something lively debate about this very

75
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:22,580
topic internally so everybody everybody

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:25,010
dropped that mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so for</font>

77

Wrigley Field that was actually taken

last year about this time on a baseball

82
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,840
trip that I took with a friend so you

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,860
can see H als is beautiful mug in the

84
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,280
background on the big old scoreboard so

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:49,370
I've been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a work in the cyber</font>

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,250
security realm for 20 years started when

87
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,610
I was with electronic data systems

88
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:59,000
otherwise known as a yes and now they're

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:10,420
I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember so I've done throughout</font>

93
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,390
my 20 years I've done literally hundreds

94
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,700
of risk assessments and some of them

95
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,680
have been better than others they keep

96
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,180
every time I do when it gets better than

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,290
the last one which i'm proud to say so

98
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bore you with any</font>

marketing spiel about this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm also</font>

after this and tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can come</font>

105
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get me up about all that about that</font>

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,920
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very pleased to expand on</font>

107
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,770
all the wonders but this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sales</font>

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,230
job for for that this is informed

109
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,640
hopefully informative been a guest

110
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,190
lecturer at Virginia Commonwealth

111
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:58,990
University and at university of richmond

112
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:02,680
and like tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other industry things</font>

113
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also teach CSM prep and i have one</font>

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,440
of my students in here from my last

115
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:17,200
course as well that's awesome let them

116
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:20,110
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have been thinking and it's</font>

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:25,630
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a heresy for a bunch of you</font>

118
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:29,110
sitting in this room that<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do we keep</font>

119
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,180
trying to determine the likelihood when

120
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,830
we do service security risk assessments

121
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:38,080
and this is this has become less of a

122
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,830
rhetorical<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for me than an</font>

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,830
actual sort of thought process and so

124
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">partly this is i'm waiting for somebody</font>

125
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,340
to jump in and yell Josh you're wrong

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,230
because I it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been known to happen once</font>

127
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,820
or twice but but let me kind of bear

128
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,529
with me here just kind of hear me out

129
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,009
and then

130
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:08,259
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk more about it so just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick</font>

131
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:10,119
refresher about risk risks are common in

132
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:14,129
a risk as a combination of threats

133
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:17,259
vulnerabilities probability / likelihood

134
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:19,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">and impacts and then of course residual</font>

135
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:22,299
risks are all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things when you</font>

136
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,069
factor for controls that might be in

137
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:26,078
place whether those are technical

138
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:30,849
operational administrative controls what

139
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:37,539
have you so everybody anybody disagree

140
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:39,039
with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's do a</font>

141
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:42,909
quick thought exercise here's what I

142
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,199
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody to do I want you to think</font>

143
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:50,049
about a recent zero-day vulnerability

144
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,179
and let's maybe think about it is

145
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:54,489
everybody's favorite whipping boy adobe

146
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:59,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">flash because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about you I</font>

147
00:07:54,489 --> 00:08:02,039
love adobe flash okay so think about

148
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:06,459
that whatever whatever that zero day is

149
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:08,739
and when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was announced you did a</font>

150
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:13,089
quick risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> assessment on about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

151
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:16,688
your organization right right yes

152
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:19,629
everybody did one I'm sure nobody does

153
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:22,509
come on let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> get real here so the first</font>

154
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:25,479
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had probably if you're like</font>

155
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,849
most people in our industry was why we

156
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,929
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> patched right away</font>

157
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:32,379
because you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want</font>

158
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:34,029
your organization you get hit so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

159
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,159
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you is what probability</font>

160
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:39,279
method did you use to derive a picture

161
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,159
of risk for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that zero day if you're like</font>

162
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,189
most you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't do that step or</font>

163
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:50,410
simply default it to guess what it's a

164
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:54,319
high-risk right anybody disagree with

165
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,110
that all right good why

166
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,580
because for why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you why did we do</font>

167
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,280
that why do we skip the step or

168
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:06,470
automatically default to it being it's a

169
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,900
high<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk and in my opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer</font>

170
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is because likelihood and probability</font>

171
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,150
are really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult it's very</font>

172
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult for us as security</font>

173
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:20,240
practitioners to get our arms around I

174
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,459
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it is for me because in</font>

175
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,890
order to derive probability of<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

176
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have a lot of input you have</font>

177
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,160
to have a lot of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> points and you</font>

178
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,690
have to control for and each one of

179
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,130
those data points is a variable and you

180
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,090
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> control for there's bit for</font>

181
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:38,900
those variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and sometimes we</font>

182
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:44,090
just don't have enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> data to make good</font>

183
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:49,730
problem to have good probability to make

184
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:52,010
a good probability decision so maybe

185
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's try to figure out a bit of the</font>

186
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,520
probability of this risk and let's let's

187
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,890
take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data this let's</font>

188
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,810
assume you have 10,000 workstations and

189
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,430
laptops in your environment I'm sure

190
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:07,130
there are several people in here with

191
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:09,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">that level of the endpoints as of</font>

192
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,910
yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this literally I look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:18,290
up yesterday they're approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.03</font>

194
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:21,770
billion websites out there in the in the

195
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,150
world and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a that's from internet</font>

196
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,290
live<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott's comment if you haven't</font>

197
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,480
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet alive Scott's not</font>

198
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:30,199
calling it's fascinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching those</font>

199
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,700
numbers so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a quick quick</font>

200
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,700
division problem you basically have a

201
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:39,260
work website to<font color="#CCCCCC"> workstation ratio of</font>

202
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:41,000
103,000 one so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those websites that</font>

203
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,610
are out there there's over 1 billion

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,470
websites how many are compromised and

205
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,850
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to again using our Adobe Flash</font>

206
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,630
zero-day exploit how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those are</font>

207
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:58,610
poisoned how many how many ads in an ad

208
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:01,689
network might be poisoned how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

209
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,690
anybody have a guess

210
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:08,160
extra as heck don't I have no earthly

211
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">clue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have no earthly clue how to even</font>

212
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,569
tell what that number is we may be able

213
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into degrees maybe I don't even</font>

214
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:20,069
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we could give him the ballpark</font>

215
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:22,649
maybe we could get into it the

216
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,329
geographic region of that but there's

217
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,730
there really is no way to tell even if

218
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:30,508
you had a worldwide sensor network like

219
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,850
a lot of the the big MS ESPYs do and

220
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:34,049
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that data even they</font>

221
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,019
don't know it's like predicting the

222
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:42,629
weather right so then think about this

223
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,860
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your users are actually then</font>

224
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:49,879
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially go and serve to a</font>

225
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,829
poison website or get hit by a drive-by

226
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,799
when they're on there you know when

227
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:58,819
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at facebook or on main</font>

228
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,459
aim your favorite website you know

229
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google right so what's the probability</font>

230
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:11,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get hit it's a</font>

231
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:15,649
likelihood<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like it right you could</font>

232
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:15,649
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely somewhere between</font>

233
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,760
right that's residual risk that's what

234
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,579
is your words yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I mean</font>

235
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,560
you're okay so you take of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one point</font>

236
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero three billion you take away a</font>

237
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,180
billion of those all right let's uh

238
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,370
maybe let's take a look at this single

239
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,949
loss expectancy ever but who in here

240
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,320
knows about single loss expectancy come

241
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:45,979
on everybody who took a cissp exam<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuh</font>

242
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,570
has seen single loss expectancy right

243
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what we're really concerned</font>

244
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:54,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the is the probability the</font>

245
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:56,519
probability / likelihood input into

246
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,699
single loss expectancy which they call

247
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:03,329
exposure factor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love this</font>

248
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:05,310
definition from Wikipedia which is the

249
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,888
subject of potential percentage of loss

250
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:13,638
to a specific asset if a specific threat

251
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:16,910
is realized he were being subjective who

252
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,800
so this is this one's driving me batty

253
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,529
since I first cut my teeth in cyber

254
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,979
security was exposure factored in fact

255
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:27,899
we had a client fairly recently within

256
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,089
the last year you'll wanted to actually

257
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,850
use this somehow as a return on

258
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:35,010
investment calculation I was like now

259
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,319
let's set let's let's steer the car left

260
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,750
here so so what's the exposure factor

261
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:44,279
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's you can do a series</font>

262
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:48,720
of exposure factors from<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero which</font>

263
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:52,079
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero SLE to through n you know</font>

264
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,750
for one and all in all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on the</font>

265
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">places</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in between but you're still</font>

266
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,120
giving kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a wild guess everybody</font>

267
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:01,860
agreeing with that anybody not agree

268
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,220
with anybody have a really good exposure

269
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:11,120
factor methodology that they used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

270
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,120
derive that darts perfect

271
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:18,540
so here's the old nest way of doing it

272
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and of course you can read the</font>

273
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,839
definitions and you know you're you're

274
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,109
still looking at sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a subjective</font>

275
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,420
measure low medium and high love those

276
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,760
now low medium and high are great

277
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,520
because they mapped at things like red

278
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,470
amber green stop lights on balanced

279
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,220
scorecards and all sorts of other stuff

280
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:44,670
but the this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all coming down</font>

281
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the gut feel here's the new newest way</font>

282
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:52,110
and I'm sorry this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is one of</font>

283
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:55,350
those I charts so they have three

284
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:58,560
different looks at the way that you sort

285
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:02,990
of take a look at likelihood the

286
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,640
likelihood of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat event initiation</font>

287
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:09,860
threat event occurrence if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

288
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,910
non-adversarial or adversarial

289
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,490
likelihood of a threat event resulting

290
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,339
in adverse impacts so there we go

291
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,650
impacts so you're looking at likelihood

292
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,040
and and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already talking about</font>

293
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,040
impacts and in terms of likelihood and

294
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you have this lovely little grid on</font>

295
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,189
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower right hand corner that you go</font>

296
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,980
to and you met you meet have the x and<font color="#E5E5E5"> y</font>

297
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">axes meet and there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go there's your</font>

298
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:42,050
whether it's low moderate high very high

299
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:46,320
so again very very scientific right

300
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:48,569
extremely right so getting a little bit

301
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,760
more scientific and this is the one I am

302
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:54,660
so sorry folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I apologize i didn't know</font>

303
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:59,580
I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I wouldn't you can walk out</font>

304
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:02,339
on me if this is too that this is this

305
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,460
is basically where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into</font>

306
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,710
predictive modeling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common</font>

307
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,080
sort of predictive modeling is something

308
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:13,010
called Monte Carlo simulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

309
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:18,930
what Monte Carlo simulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you run</font>

310
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:21,510
hundreds to thousands of computations

311
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,420
for an algorithm for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monte Carlo</font>

312
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:28,460
method algorithm

313
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:30,779
and it uses random inputs to derive a

314
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,570
probability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some sort and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

315
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:36,660
it's expressed as points on a bill curve

316
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,790
and so of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 50th percentile</font>

317
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,240
right in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle is your most likely</font>

318
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer but if you read these and I'm</font>

319
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,650
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read a couple of them to you</font>

320
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:51,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I don't want on anybody coming</font>

321
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:54,089
to me for their optometrist felt so

322
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,730
normal or bell curve the user simply

323
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,589
defines the mean or expected value and a

324
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,740
standard deviation to describe the

325
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:04,260
variation about the mean buddy

326
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,510
understand that one so you have two

327
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,459
inputs that you are having to provide

328
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,550
and you're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with so the</font>

329
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expected value your expected value</font>

330
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,720
and a standard deviation from it so what

331
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,560
do you what standard deviation do you

332
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,630
put in to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heck knows log normal</font>

333
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,030
values are positively skewed not

334
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,679
symmetric like a normal distribution

335
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose to represent values that don't go</font>

336
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,110
below zero but have unlimited positive

337
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,320
potential okay that's that's fantastic

338
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:41,969
you still have to provide some sort of

339
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:45,450
an input into that that is some expected

340
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,070
result uniform all values have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an equal</font>

341
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,160
chance of occurring in the user simply

342
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:53,178
defines the minimum and<font color="#CCCCCC"> maximum between</font>

343
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,860
one and n so somewhere between one and n

344
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,690
this Monte Carlo simulation is going to

345
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,100
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plot that you can see some</font>

346
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,310
examples of how those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and</font>

347
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,980
they're actually legitimate examples

348
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:08,520
triangular this is the one that I that

349
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:13,040
makes me laugh these are defines the

350
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:15,540
minimum most<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely and maximum values</font>

351
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,149
so you have to know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in a</font>

352
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,710
triangular<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monte Carlo simulation you</font>

353
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,040
have to know what the most likely is

354
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,230
that doesn't really help believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I've</font>

355
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,440
played with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that risk a whole heck of a</font>

356
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,250
lot to to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this to do what I</font>

357
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,750
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

358
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't get it to work so maybe there's an</font>

359
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,970
at-risk guru in here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> know something</font>

360
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,930
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do where the internet does</font>

361
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:41,910
perv that's pretty much that defines the

362
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,940
minimum most<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely and maximum values</font>

363
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:48,090
just like the triangular distribution

364
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,590
but it basically outputs them the

365
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,300
results in a different way and then

366
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,490
discreet these are defined specific

367
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:59,280
values that may occur and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> likelihood</font>

368
00:18:53,490 --> 00:19:01,950
of each not exactly helpful so one of

369
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,850
the things that predictive threat

370
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:09,600
modeling predictive probability needs is

371
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:13,679
it means a lot of historical data but

372
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:18,169
what would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things that you're</font>

373
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:21,060
supposed to switch the slide now is

374
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,880
we're always getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even if we're</font>

375
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,940
using other predictive modeling

376
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,540
techniques like clustering whatever what

377
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:35,640
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting to is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have enough</font>

378
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:38,070

disclaimer past performance are not

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:44,460
indicative of future results just

381
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,800
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know what happened in the</font>

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,650
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we have that historical record</font>

383

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be true for the future so in</font>

385
00:19:52,020 --> 00:20:00,420
the past we didn't have ransomware who

386
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,840
now we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have would</font>

387

have in their risk modeling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk</font>

388
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,209
assessments would have thought we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

389
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,780
have been dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

390
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:12,710
ransomware we knew malicious code but we

391
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:20,370
didn't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't know what the</font>

392
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:22,650
doesn't impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here is my</font>

393
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:26,219
question to you what if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put</font>

394
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:29,400
chasing our tails on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> or just focus</font>

395
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,690
on threat credibility instead and we

396
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop trying to do likelihood because</font>

397
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,610
here's my thinking on this if it's a

398
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,570
credible threat does it that mean it's

399
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:46,740
probable we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have volcanic activity</font>

400
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:49,139
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Virginia so is volcanic activity a</font>

401
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,480
credible threat no it is not a credible

402
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,070
threat for Virginia it's a credible

403
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,500
threat for Washington State and Hawaii

404
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,870
but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> credible for it here so</font>

405
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,960
what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you take a look at</font>

406
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,699
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> these this isn't an ad for NIST</font>

407
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,920
or the way they doing your mileage may

408
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:15,410
vary on this but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is out</font>

409
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:17,790
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this special publication 804 town</font>

410
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,190
determining whether or not there's

411
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,710
there's a threat date it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to have the</font>

412
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:26,390
capability or means has to have some

<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a motivation or intent and</font>

414
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:34,200
sometimes it if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's that</font>

415
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,210
you are a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whatever that threat</font>

is that threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher if you will then</font>

417
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,870
you you can use these lovely tables and

418
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,429
I like these how they say in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second</font>

419
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,739
column on all these semi quantitative

421
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:56,160
their semi quantitative volume okay so

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,140
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you take a look at this and</font>

426
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,960
from the standpoint of threads and

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:15,840
threat credibility and the impacts of

428

them exploiting a vulnerability that's

429
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,889
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want to get you that's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">escorial we know that zero day it</font>

434
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,470
threats and vulnerabilities are real

435
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,720
then what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it matter what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

436
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,570
likelihood is we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at</font>

437
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the potential impacts are what are</font>

438
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,460
potential vulnerabilities are to it and

439
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:44,560
then determine what our control strategy

440
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:49,180
and whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's accurate and</font>

441
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:54,210
that and that provides what the data we

442
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,210
willing so that's those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> my thoughts</font>

443

all right ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss so here we're</font>

blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> a meal Paula so does everybody</font>

447
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:37,480
think about what I've said on I'm gonna

open i totally agree with you in the

450
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,330
sense that i have always felt like when

451
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,060
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number associated with</font>

452

likelihood i don't think we have any

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,409
data most of the time to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

454
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,570
that I've all its faults from that

don't think go far enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest i</font>

457
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,630
don't i don't think nowadays we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

458
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:11,320
full understanding of impact and i think

459
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,270
that i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> a both a privacy in a cyber</font>

get pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> riled up about is a</font>

462
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:21,910
corporation will think of impact of a

breach of PII to themselves but not to

464
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,430
the individual right so they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

465
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two what do</font>

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have to provide coverage you know</font>

467
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,030
some type of so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually think the</font>

468
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,350
whole risk model is up for question at

469
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,360
this point because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

470
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,699
necessarily know what the adversary is

471
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,439
up to I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do things that</font>

472
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,630
surprised this we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know I</font>

473
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,610
think the whole thing is up for question

474
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:50,140
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now wow you said I didn't go far</font>

475
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,850
enough I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought it was going</font>

476
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:56,770
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like really super</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> controversial</font>

477
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:00,010
here Oh sir thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you good feedback on</font>

478
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:04,660
that one I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see in my</font>

479
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:07,960
opinion all right before before i get to

480
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,970
you can I ask a question who in here has

481
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,850
a really really good business impact

482
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,340
analysis that they rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to tell them</font>

483
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:20,550
what the consequences of a risk event

484
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,550
are that's what I thought

485
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:30,769
so I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been rethinking this process and</font>

486
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,039
have recognized that for each of the six

487
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:35,679
major phases a product goes through

488
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,779
before it's actually put on your machine

489
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,429
that each of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are gained</font>

490
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,399
there's actually a game<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory model</font>

491
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:46,279
we've that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I created as an example from</font>

492
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:49,250
the standards based systems if you take

493
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:52,039
a standard like<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pick one of the ITF</font>

494
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,710
oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E whatever there's actually</font>

495
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,600
game theory taking place to take one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

496
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,990
those products<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it do something</font>

497
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,510
for somebody you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

498
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:05,149
players are and the players are changing

499
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,429
therefore the standards themselves that

500
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:09,768
are implemented may have falls in them

501
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,539
before the code is actually written then

502
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:14,029
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have the code people that</font>

503
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:17,090
are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of that that inject</font>

504
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:18,590
specific risk profiles that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

505
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware of the game there is a game theory</font>

506
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,689
model for that once it's actually picked

507
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,490
up by the vendors then there's a game

508
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,710
theory that models you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

509
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,019
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I actually take as an</font>

510
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:32,419
example sorry I'm known for my ipv6

511
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:34,880
stuff but most of the products out there

512
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:37,789
do not support ipv6 they claim ipv6

513
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,980
support and we have ten percent

514
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:43,010
population using it right now and we

515
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,870
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way detecting it so once it's</font>

516
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,629
actually implemented you have a business

517
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,580
model and game theory for that until

518
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:53,539
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> operationalize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get</font>

519
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the sim management process that's</font>

520
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:57,830
actually where we're that's what you're

521
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about is here's all the stuff I</font>

522
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,620
have in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

523
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:06,830
predict what's happening until we get to

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of life so if we take a look at</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">longtail decisions a long tail decision</font>

526
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:17,799
made in the protocol can actually exist

527
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:20,299
for 15-20 years before it actually

528
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,639
touches you and you're actually trying

529
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:24,799
to then create a risk model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

530
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:28,070
what the problem is is that you're

531
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at snapshot in time based on not</font>

532
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,000
full knowledge of partial knowledge and

533
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:34,010
you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

534
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,590
define that without actually adding game

535
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:38,360
theories that make sense I'm submitting

536
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:42,740
something for RSA specifically around

537
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,000
this topic I'll be there maybe actually

538
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:50,450
maybe you should have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> given this</font>

talk no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually i think that there's</font>

540
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:55,160
there's a of what i understood of what

541
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,900
you were saying and I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

542
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,550
confess you were blowing my mind on some

543
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:03,830
of this stuff the UM that that you're

544
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">right from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint of standards</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols you know there's there's a</font>

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:12,860
if you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not doing risk</font>

00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:15,260
assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in all the phases it</font>

548
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,240
we can get left with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty bad</font>

549
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,010
stuff think about things like wired

550
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,650
equivalent privacy which was anything

551
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:26,930
but it was it's actually reimplemented

552
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:30,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I Tripoli standards that are being</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rolled out weapons back and worse than</font>

554
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:39,580
ever all right um any other good good

555
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,000
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much great good at blood</font>

556
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,000
other thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

557
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:54,590
are you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh I mean we could do</font>

558
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:58,139
like you know arm wrestling up here good

559
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:02,999
how would you balance so you're you're

560
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:05,070
credible threat and probable threat I am

561
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:07,919
worried a little bit about the potential

562
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:11,539
tunnel vision that happens when you only

563
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:16,080
focus on threats that are credible and

564
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:19,499
so how do you balance that with wanting

565
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">to protect against the most probable</font>

566
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:23,509
things the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> probable exploits</font>

567
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:38,330
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really stop to jump on that one</font>

568
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:44,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">no um so that is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> therein lies this</font>

569
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:47,720
is a philosophical thing for me so the

570
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:54,230
bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have better imaginations that</font>

571
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:57,860
we do and we are limited in some ways

572
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:02,379
first off we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we are limited in terms</font>

573
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:04,820
of I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in here may I</font>

574
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:07,699
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not speaking at a school</font>

575
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:12,649
is a relatively honest and decent

576
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:17,269
upstanding citizen and is yeah well you

577
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:19,668
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> channels i mean come on so so we</font>

578
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:20,840
have a limitation of imagination so so

579
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:22,309
when we're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> together risk</font>

580
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,129
assessments we're only looking at the

581
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:28,908
threats that we can contemplate in the

582
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:32,000
first place<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

583
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:35,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic bullet in probability that</font>

584
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,600
necessarily helps us to think more

585
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,240
outside of the box about specific

586
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,240
threats however we can think if we think

587
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:48,259
about threats maybe in a different way

588
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,139
and a broader sense that might be able

589
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:53,750
to help us the problem with that is as

590
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:55,789
you go up in threat categories like

591
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,970
instead of taking a look at in the

592
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:02,809
example that I gave zero-day exploit a

593
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,940
specific zero-day<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploit I and you just</font>

594
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,639
called it<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero day exploits or you just</font>

595
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,909
called it malicious code then you start

596
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">to lose resolution on that particular</font>

597
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,360
threat on that particular bad thing that

598
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">could happen because if you're just</font>

599
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,370
getting to malicious code as a general

600
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:25,100
category of threat it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

601
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:28,279
but what are the typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

602
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,709
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for as vulnerable ities and then we</font>

603
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:32,419
implement controls around black you know

604
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,730
we're looking at lack of malware

605
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,789
detection mail or prevention we're

606
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,859
looking at

607
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:42,570
you know it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices at the perimeter</font>

608
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:45,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe even sometimes with within the</font>

609
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:51,269
soft gooey center of our of our

610
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:53,100
infrastructures and so when the new when

611
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,639
the new whiz-bang piece of malicious

612
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,928
code comes out we're really ready for it

613
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:59,488
we're really prepared for because we're

614
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:04,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">still thing you know we're looking at</font>

615
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:10,409
signature based attacks attack detection

616
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:13,259
right so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ok yeah I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so so I</font>

617
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:14,820
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's and that's it that's</font>

618
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:18,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">a topic for that maybe that's the next</font>

619
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:21,149
paper i'll submit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tiwa tarvey a sec</font>

620
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,700
is how do we is like how do you develop

621
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,939
a credible threat list that's a that's

622
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,619
that's always been an interesting one

623
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so chandus did have this hand up</font>

624
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:35,728
and i'll i'll get you ever when I

625
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:38,789
promise so the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a risk</font>

626
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:42,929
assessment is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help prioritize arbors</font>

627
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:44,700
and to you know this once more likely we

628
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:48,330
need to go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so if you</font>

629
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,399
remove the likelihood number then you're

630
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:56,070
not you can't have a distinguishing

631
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:58,590
factor to help better prioritize so what

632
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:01,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there else that we could include to</font>

633
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,840
actually make a prioritized list off of

634
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:05,580
the risk assessment that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font>

635
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:12,139
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was that was actually the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

636
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:15,178
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was anticipating if you are looking at</font>

637
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:17,248
risk and you are actually measuring risk

638
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:19,970
rather than using a verb like low

639
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:22,979
moderate hi you know

640
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,739
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious then

641
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:27,210
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more resolution into what</font>

642
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:28,919
the priorities are if you could if

643
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,349
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually applying a quantitative</font>

644
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:36,029
metric to it and there are quantitative

645
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:38,158
models out there for for risk then that

646
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,919
then the numbers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get help you</font>

647
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,259
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prioritize the bad if you can</font>

648
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,570
quantify impact and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we're</font>

649
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:48,299
really looking at is what what are the

650
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,090
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the highest impact to</font>

651
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,690
our

652
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:56,350
business organizations then then you can

653
00:33:52,690 --> 00:34:04,780
do it so that that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> my answer I</font>

654
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:07,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say and we can you know sure true</font>

655
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:19,719
there are black swans but is an asteroid

656
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:21,460
a credible threat that's right I'm not

657
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">going I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to name names here</font>

658
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:28,900
but used to have I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with</font>

659
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:32,529
somebody who talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about emanations and</font>

660
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:38,200
penumbra's from the Sun as a as a threat

661
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:40,890
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was those funny oh hang on sec I</font>

662
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,889
had one gentleman

663
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:56,140
I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to the keynote this</font>

664
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:59,440
morning talking about having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

665
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:01,359
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you can be pretty</font>

666
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,450
sure if you have a wide variety of

667
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,700
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you stay in touch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

668
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:09,069
somebody in that group is going to look

669
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,589
at every single possible risk as be

670
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:14,590
incredible for them they will be your

671
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">experts if you ever just wonder like</font>

672
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a few minutes what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

673
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:23,110
you could ask them NASA learned to have

674
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,540
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred people on some project</font>

675
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:28,170
teams as different from each other as

676
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,400
possible so they wouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

677
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,740
multi-hundred million dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> or screw</font>

678
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:38,860
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose a satellite because somebody</font>

679
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:40,899
used the wrong units of measurement you

680
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,700
can't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough I balls to make</font>

681
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,280
bug shall will they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different</font>

682
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,049
eyeballs you have to be they have to be

683
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that so you don't end up with</font>

684
00:35:47,050 --> 00:36:00,460
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> group thing all right yeah you know</font>

685
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,890
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is room in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in risk assessment and</font>

686
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:08,010
risk of measurement and and certainly in

687
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:11,620
mitigation strategies for consensus and

688
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:14,860
for lots of different different ending

689
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:17,620
and potentially converging opinions that

690
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:20,110
makes the organization stronger because

691
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,600
a lot of times the naysayers get shut

692
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:25,810
down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes the naysayers are the</font>

693
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,810
ones who make everybody stop and really

694
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:31,630
think in the end they they provide a

695
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:34,930
good checkpoint for for everybody I<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

696
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">it when people are like well Josh well</font>

697
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,879
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and I SAT there and I'm</font>

698
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:42,220
like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're right I didn't</font>

699
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:49,170
see that that's and that's part of us

700
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:51,939
not as having a problem of maybe it's

701
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:54,240
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting too existential here</font>

702
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:57,400
maybe it's a it's a it's a pride thing

703
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,430
we're paid to know a lot

704
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,680
we're paid to provide good at good sound

705
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:05,230
advice and sometimes and I know I've

706
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:10,990
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in my career if blinders on and</font>

707
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:13,060
we don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> see everything so</font>

708
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,770
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give some clarity on your</font>

709
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,720
definition of credible threat because i

710
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,150
was listening it sounds largely

711
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,470
synonymous with likelihood<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm with</font>

712
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,870
this gentleman here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only reason you</font>

713
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,299
call the asteroid is not credible is

714
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:32,980
because it's incredibly low likelihood

715
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:35,170
so explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for me remember when i</font>

716
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:44,860
was saying i love it<font color="#CCCCCC"> when people stop me</font>

717
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">in my tracks you you know what you are</font>

718
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:52,900
right and and so that the building of a

719
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:57,310
of what we would call a credible threat

720
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:59,830
table what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit slist there is</font>

721
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:03,340
there is a lot of subjectivity still in

722
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:08,440
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

723
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:11,740
there's experience there is learning

724
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:15,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">from those that went before us other</font>

725
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,069
people who have maybe done more work in

726
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:21,340
the field and more research in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the field</font>

727
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:23,770
so at a certain point all risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

728
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:27,280
a squish to it there is a subjectivity

729
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:30,550
somewhere along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chain and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

730
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,620
that what what I'm what I've been kind

731
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:35,260
of thinking is there are those two

732
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:39,609
points of squish there's the point of

733
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:41,980
squish of of the threats and as a point

734
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:45,040
of squish of and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a scientific</font>

735
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:48,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">term by the way squish and there's a</font>

736
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of squish when it comes to</font>

737
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:55,660
probability as well and so being more of

738
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:58,780
a numbers driven guy maybe to my

739
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,879
detriment there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really trying to</font>

740
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,860
just pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> out some more so as much</font>

741
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,620
squish as possible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

742
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,140
there there there's a there's a judgment

743
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,569
call

744
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:12,190
on even on creating you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

745
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:12,190
threats that we're going to assess

746
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,690
that's part of the impact are you

747
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,789
actually defining constraints let me

748
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:22,130
give you an example behavior versus

749
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:24,170
signature the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of blocks that I</font>

750
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,970
can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a firewall before the fire</font>

751
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:28,849

752
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:32,149
router or how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many signatures can</font>

753
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:34,309
actually be loaded into a virus

754
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:37,700
protection before the vendor removes

755
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:40,789
them identifying those particular

756
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:44,089
constraints based on gold rats work in

757
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:46,400
in constraint modeling is something that

758
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:50,049
we're missing also in risk is an example

759
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,049
one that can you were talking about

760
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:58,549
black swans some of the black swans were

761
00:39:54,799 --> 00:40:00,230
predictable based on things that have

762
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:02,509
happened in papers that came out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

763
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,490
60s and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 70s that we don't go back</font>

764
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and read from a risk bottle exam point</font>

765
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:15,200
anybody have feedback about that all

766
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:17,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what occurs to me as I</font>

768
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:22,549
classical definition of likelihood has

769
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:24,319
always been based more on internal

770
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:26,480
factors internal to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,359
internal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network and is the</font>

773
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:36,619
to be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a industry level or a</font>

774
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:39,829
shared definition where it's calculated

775
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:42,500
independent independent of maybe your

776
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:44,569
specifics with general characteristics

777
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,609
and expanded that way as we get into

778
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:50,269
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a community based threat</font>

779
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:53,990
modeling I think that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic idea</font>

780
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:57,169
because threat intelligence data I don't

781
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:59,508
know how many folks here work with or

782
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,339
have work with the federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

783
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:04,450
they have the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence</font>

784
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:07,160
apparatus in the country I you know

785
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:09,348
except for maybe there are a couple of

786
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:14,118
<font color="#CCCCCC">private companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there but we don't</font>

00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:15,950
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they're</font>

788
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,700
they're bad at sharing threat

00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligence data amongst</font>

790
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,089
themselves and they still fight that and

791
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,680
they still will deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even</font>

792
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">though they have you know things like</font>

threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence sharing and there</font>

797
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:35,970
are ice axe out there that are that are

798
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:39,810
sponsored throughout industry and it's

799
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:45,080
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's getting better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

800
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:47,700
an industry an industry threat a

801
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:50,009
cross-industry threat sharing cross

802
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,890
vertical threat sharing i think is great

803
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:55,140
and there are they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good for</font>

804
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">those in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health care sector the high</font>

805
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,740
trust alliance has really good threat

806
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,900
intelligence briefing but again they're

807
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">just look at what's being reported from</font>

808
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,980
their membership that it's in the

809
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:07,200
medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> community that still could apply</font>

810
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,060
to the financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> services community or</font>

811
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,009
the retail community because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what</font>

812
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,759
hospitals and doctors offices take

813
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,760
credit cards too

814
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,089
yes sir

815
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,680
just a quick observation on the point

816
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:30,170
made and then a follow-up question I

817
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,730
promise they'll both be quick first of

818
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,890
all one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I realized I think coming</font>

819
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">from this conversation is that you know</font>

820
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">we we've seen earlier today that there</font>

821
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:39,740
are difficulties with information

822
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,200
sharing and so on and you're talking

823
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">about challenges with understanding</font>

824
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">likelihood and that it's all guesswork</font>

825
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,450
and all that somehow those two problems

826
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,279
seem to it to one way potentially of

827
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:56,379
convincing<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

828
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:59,329
is that they would have perhaps improved

829
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:01,420
likelihood and threat credibility

830
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:07,869
estimates so that's just a quick

831
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:10,369
observation now to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bayesian I so I</font>

832
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:12,020
noticed that you I'm not I'm a

833
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:15,200
frequentist myself but I noticed that

834
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,538
you you know when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about the</font>

835
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,879
note that not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to model</font>

836
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:21,890
likelihood and as I understand it the

837
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bayesian czar gyea meant to that is well</font>

838
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,150
you pick something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems to make</font>

839
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,189
sense and then as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get additional</font>

840
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:31,609
data along the ways you adjust your

841
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,500
likelihood values and you know the magic

842
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:37,150
of Bayes will just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all work so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

843
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:41,289
was interested in your thoughts on that

844
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,289
besides a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little dance you just did</font>

845
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:54,190
so I've two thoughts on that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm</font>

846
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:56,230
that requires that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we collect data more</font>

847
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,030
frequently and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze it and we</font>

848
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,000
utilize that we in put it in the models

849
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:07,780
or frequently than we do okay i'm gonna

850
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:15,460
put down my water show of hands how many

851
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:21,430
people do assess risk on a daily basis

852
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:40,110
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their organizations that's what I</font>

853
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:40,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought how many you do yes sir</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

854
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:51,100
that was good I like that if you're like

855
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:54,400
most organizations you do a risk

856
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,140
assessment on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something so</font>

857
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,720
whatever whatever the scope of the

858
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:02,890
assessment is your may be doing it once

859
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,589
a year if you live in a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

860
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:08,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">some particular government organizations</font>

861
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:11,260
you're only required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do them formally</font>

862
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,509
once every three years supposed to dust

863
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,750
it off once a year and take a look at it

864
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:20,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it's still you know smells</font>

865
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:23,200
and looks relatively the same but the

866
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,810
young but the fact is you know we we

867
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:30,549
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have we have an operational</font>

868
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:33,340
tempo in our in most organizations that

869
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:36,460
prevents us from really truly doing risk

870
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,590
assessment as often as we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so</font>

871
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,350
there's there's that there's frequency

872
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:43,840
of getting the data input to refine the

873
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:47,259
model I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that's unless you</font>

874
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,680
have again worldwide sensor network that

875
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:53,170
is really collecting good data and can

876
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,109
has really good visibility the other

877
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:57,430
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there's I have a little</font>

878
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,900
bit of a concern and I'm not a

879
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,558
mathematician but I have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

880
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,209
a concern

881
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:06,999
with that of regression to the mean and

882
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:10,269
so what you get is you get a sort of an

883
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:12,459
average<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you don't capture any inning</font>

884
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:15,788
ends of the bell curve which could also

885
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:18,848
buy to know you always as much as

886
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:21,430
possible you want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to hit</font>

887
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:23,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle but there are some things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

888
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,899
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that offline if you</font>

889
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,788
want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you you want to know</font>

890
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the what the hive what the right</font>

891
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:33,759
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve looks like because you</font>

892
00:46:30,009 --> 00:46:35,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">may get asked about it um other how we</font>

893
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:37,539
doing on time two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes all right we</font>

894
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:41,669
have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes maybe one more quick</font>

895
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:44,170
question or one more quick comment share

896
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,269
or we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here two minutes</font>

897
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:51,369
early and I can release you back to the

898
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:56,078
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your lives oh yes sir she could</font>

899
00:46:51,369 --> 00:47:03,039
MIT or caltech just a geek it's easier

900
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:05,380
that way question for you so so we so we

901
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,449
rushed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department Congress pushing</font>

902
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:12,189
everybody into compliance in the late

903
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:15,640
90s during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> marsh warm during other</font>

904
00:47:12,189 --> 00:47:19,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">things as as we took as we move forward</font>

905
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,538
so has compliance actually increased

906
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:26,469
this level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk based on trying to</font>

907
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:28,539
meet a a floor a minimal floor instead

908
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:32,709
of actually a ceiling that's specific to

909
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:36,269
each company making the whole model you

910
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:36,269
know none usable

911
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:51,070
yes and no better<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in 30 seconds</font>

912
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:53,560
30 seconds or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less and by the way camera</font>

913
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:55,900
guy am so sorry I completely screwed you

914
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:01,570
up and told you I was going to sit still

915
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I just can't okay so is everybody</font>

916
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:06,540
hopefully in this room knows compliance

917
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:10,690
is not security but my opinion is that

918
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:13,420
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> off there is no ceiling that that</font>

919
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:15,490
because the the threat landscape shifts

920
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology shifts so there's no</font>

921
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:22,149
ceiling there's no there's no such thing

922
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">as too good of a security program there</font>

923
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">is definitely too much security to the</font>

924
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">point where people can't get their jobs</font>

925
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:31,030
done but there's not no such thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

926
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:35,920
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> good a security program the other</font>

927
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:40,330
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in my opinion even though</font>

928
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:45,700
compliance is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal security I would</font>

929
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:47,710
rather have let's call it five to ten

930
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,930
percent of something than a hundred

931
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,420
percent of nothing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> advanced security</font>

932
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:56,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">in an organization that's that's my</font>

933
00:48:52,420 --> 00:49:03,060
humble opinion so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't drop the mic</font>

934
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:03,060
all right I love that thanks everyone
