know we're right in front<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the social</font>

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,989
hour when I first looked at the program

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,820
I thought my talk was side by side with

10
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:45,129
the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour and I got really afraid</font>

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,600
but then I looked closer and saw you

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,930
know what social hour starts after we

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,330

everything across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spectrum from the</font>

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,480
world of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and application</font>

central security team there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had</font>

26
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,200
the the advantage to speak at a number

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,750
of different conferences around the

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,659
world and share this this story that

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll share with you today so really the</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda that i have for this talk</font>

31
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,119
first I want to just introduce kind of

32
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">the what I see is the problem space here</font>

33
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,590
or why do we why do we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this</font>

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,090
thing that I call<font color="#CCCCCC"> application security</font>

35
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,960
awareness what is it what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,960

37
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,520
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did anything</font>

38
00:01:52,790 --> 00:02:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to turn it off and back on</font>

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with the problem space and I'm</font>

42
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,720
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you about what i call a</font>

43
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,640
sustainable security culture kind of

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,300
introduce the concepts behind that and

45
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,070
then we'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know how you</font>

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go about creating your own</font>

47
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,280
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> security awareness program</font>

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,200
based on the principles that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll share</font>

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you here but just to help me kind</font>

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,510
of know who I'm speaking to hear if

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,370
you're part of the applicant application

52
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,620
security function in your organization

53
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,040
raise your hand let me see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we got a</font>

54
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,930
good maybe thirty two percent or so how

55
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information security side is</font>

56
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,630
that everybody else that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,800
everybody else are still a few

58
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,829
stragglers what did I what did I miss

59
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,890
audit anybody from the audit know any

60
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:50,959
professional golf players no none of

61
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:53,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">those okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so yeah I guess that</font>

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,010
gives me a good perspective to you know

63
00:02:53,209 --> 00:03:00,230
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of speak more to the information</font>

64
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,820
security side perhaps okay well I'm

65
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep moving</font>

66
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,640
here and eventually the picture will

67
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,200
show up behind me but i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font>

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,130
act like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a professional and you know</font>

69
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't even know that this thing's</font>

70
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,459
missing from behind me here but really

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,160
the first thing i wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

72
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you is I took this quote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from this</font>

73
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,660
famous philosopher of Silicon Valley a

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,329
guy by the name of Marc Andreessen he

75
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,620
gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> us the mosaic browser and Netscape</font>

76
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,480
and a bunch of other things and he's a

77
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,200
multi-billionaire but he shares this

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,090
idea of software is eating the world

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and this you know it's it's kind of</font>

80
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,459
an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote kind of a pithy</font>

81
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,870
quote but what he really means is that

82
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,730
there's software in everything these

83
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,489
days right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean we know this as</font>

84
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,500
security professionals we we see the

85
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,970
easy things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the firewalls</font>

86
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,030
and desktops and all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

87
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,220
deal with but there's also you know car

88
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,840
smartphones medical devices even power

89
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,370
plants<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been studying that over the</font>

90
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,320
last couple of months and it's scary how

91
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,459
much software and technology is actually

92
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,290
driving the average nuclear power plant

93
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,150
but that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> reminds us how important</font>

94
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,250
it is from an application security

95
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,560
perspective to really you know do

96
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,060
application security well because soft

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,099
where is everywhere it is sprinkled into

98
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:15,950
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do so customers also</font>

99
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,370
demand security in everything that we

100
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,418
provide them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody has a</font>

101
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,190
customer right and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

102
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">what industry you're in you know if</font>

103
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,020
you're a product company it's very easy

104
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,610
to understand who your customers are you

105
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,740
know if you're a bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's the the</font>

106
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,770
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know keep their money</font>

107
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,360
with you but the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that none</font>

108
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,010
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are going to tell you oh</font>

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,630
security that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matter to</font>

110
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,950
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it doesn't I don't care about</font>

111
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,930
security it's not not something I'm

112
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,560
really concerned about everybody has a

113
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,210
perspective on security at this point

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,340
and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's you know</font>

115
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,388
everybody cares about it no one's going

116
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,159
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and sit across the table from</font>

117
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,690
you and say not only care it's fine you

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we're gonna veil ability security</font>

119
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,930
is not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really care about and</font>

120
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,880
we know that you know vulnerabilities

121
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,010
and bug counts these things do continue

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,110
to rise like crazy you know we have

123
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,280
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the different giant</font>

124
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,810
vulnerabilities we've had in the last

125
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,340
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have their own marketing</font>

126
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">campaigns right why does the</font>

127
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,520
vulnerability need a website I don't

128
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,150
know why does you know the heart bleeds

129
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,530
in you know the drown bash bug poodle

130
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,060
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things they have their own</font>

131
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,070
marketing<font color="#E5E5E5"> department almost at this</font>

132
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,780
point but those aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even the</font>

133
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,060
vulnerabilities that really keep me up

134
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,130
at night though the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm more</font>

135
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,260
concerned with our the vulnerabilities

136
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,090
that we capture within the OWASP top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

137
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know everybody in this room knows</font>

138
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,169
this you probably live this this you

139
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,750
know the different vulnerabilities that

140
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist here but it's crazy how many times</font>

141
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,500
organizations can't even get the OAuth

142
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,030
top one right you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'd love</font>

143
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,710
to see us just<font color="#CCCCCC"> call it the OWASP top</font>

144
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,359
three for a couple of years let's knock

145
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,560
out these first three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys who</font>

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
sigil talked about that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,550
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> but let's let's compress this</font>

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,109
down and just work on a couple of them

149
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,600
at a time because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can't even</font>

150
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix the first one on the list and you</font>

151
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,750
know I borrowed this from the nice folks

152
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,820
at Vera code they had this they did all

153
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">this they have this state of application</font>

154
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,960
security report that they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

155
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,340
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was relatively eye-opening</font>

156
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,380
though to look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see across</font>

157
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different industries the best we can</font>

158
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,780
do is say that the best of the worst how

159
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,940
many of these of their applications

160
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,409
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> fail the OWASP top ten upon</font>

161
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,930

162
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:21,070
services comes in at you know

163
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,020
fifty-eight percent which is the best

164
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,849
score government up there at<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy six</font>

165
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent so this tells me that the</font>

166
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,539
developers and these organizations don't

167
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,789
really know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do for</font>

168
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:34,780
security you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font>

169
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,039
what needs to be developed there where

170
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,960
do these vulnerabilities come into the

171
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,820
process where where are they where are

172
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,289
they introduced here this is a you know

173
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,210
it's a typical secure development

<font color="#E5E5E5">lifecycle or you know secure software</font>

175
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,359

176
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,219
to call it it's kind of standard but

177
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,360
from my perspective I see these things

178
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,830
come in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the design and the</font>

179
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">development phase that's where that's</font>

180
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,060
where most of these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in</font>

181
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,430
that's where these missed you know it

182
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,810
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that their mistakes it could be</font>

183
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're just bad decisions that</font>

184
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,259
happens way too many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

185
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,030
somebody just makes a truly a bad

186
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,490
decision they should know better but

187
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,888
nobody's ever taught them the lesson

188
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,050
about sequel injection or whatever the

189
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,000
lesson might be and I know everybody

190
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,250
loves this type of a chart because it

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,780
shows how you know I see the the guy

192
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,800
from sigil nodding his head with making

193
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,619
fun of this type of a chart earlier

194
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,570
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it now but it's</font>

195
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,220
based on IBM's research we all know this

196
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,770
it just makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's common sense</font>

197
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,360
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately common sense isn't</font>

198
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,389
always that common in every organization

199
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,500
as that I find as I go around right but

200
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,330
you know it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's going</font>

201
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cost more to fix a bug later on in a</font>

202
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,789
life cycle so let's stop for a second to

203
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,740
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what is the the average</font>

204
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,870
developer what's the mindset of the

205
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">average developer in your organization</font>

206
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,810
so stop for just a second and think

207
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,949
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because everybody in</font>

208
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,669
this room probably has at least one

209
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,259
developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works in your company and</font>

210
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,960
so you might say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you know you're</font>

211
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">about to make a statement about these</font>

212
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,070
developers but we have these this small

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">group of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ok</font>

214
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,719
so I said the average developer not the

215
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,800
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> security conscious developer you</font>

216
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,360
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your team who loves</font>

217
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,740
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and comes to conferences and</font>

218
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,860
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sitting next to you in the room</font>

219
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,900
right now but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about you</font>

220
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,659
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a developer work towards</font>

221
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,419
well bug free code that delay is

222
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,180
delivered on time feature complete is it

223
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:24,698
on budget and you know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

224
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,810
know when you ask developers or anybody

225
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,029
they'll say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have two</font>

226
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,130
out of three things good<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast or cheap</font>

227
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:32,289
and I tend to lump secure in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

228
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,700
good category<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so that this is kind</font>

229
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mindset that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working to</font>

230
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,330
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they're they're focused</font>

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,790
on I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ship the code I have to get</font>

232
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,530
these things out and security if it's

233
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,179
not embedded in the culture of their

234
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,220
organization and it's not what they know

235
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,459
and understand then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

236
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,920
be their first thought and when I find

237
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,570
is that you know ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I when</font>

238
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I look and work with big organizations

239
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,630
security is a stretch for almost

240
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,130
everyone in the organization you know

241
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,320
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the central security teams</font>

242
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,540
that if they exist depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

243
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,310
maturity of the organization but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

244
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,680
really comes down to people just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

245
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,880
understand what the real problem is from

246
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,680
a security perspective they don't

247
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,240
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost the risk and all</font>

248
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,099
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are being introduced</font>

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,750
and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that foundational</font>

250
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,640
knowledge of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what even is</font>

251
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">application security maybe they have a</font>

252
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,670
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> that focuses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it maybe they</font>

253
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,920
have a couple depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how big the</font>

254
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,110
company is but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they up the average</font>

255
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,219
person that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get you</font>

256
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,100
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what the what the</font>

257
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,170
challenge is there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand</font>

258
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,880
the ramifications of not doing something

259
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,729
right they don't understand what a

260
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,230
sequel injection is the average web

261
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,820
programmer doesn't understand what that

262
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,680
is and understand what the concept is

263
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,930
and what causes it cross-site scripting

264
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,979
but the bigger problem that I that I

265
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:47,079
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> find is and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think where we tend</font>

266
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fall down quite a bit is we don't</font>

267
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,460
teach people why why should you care

268
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,080
about this stuff we know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't start</font>

269
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,640
with why we start with here's all the

270
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,100
secure coding techniques that you need

271
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,260
to learn and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll send you to maybe a</font>

272
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,690
40-hour class well you'll just dive deep

273
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,860
into it and then unfortunately over the

274
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,540
next couple of months you'll forget

275
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,910
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you learned there but we</font>

276
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,640
don't set that<font color="#E5E5E5"> precedent of why do you</font>

277
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,040
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care about these things and when</font>

278
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,480
I find is that you know the developers

279
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,890
that I work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to these are</font>

280
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,540
not monsters you know they're not

281
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,250
sociopaths that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like I'm just not</font>

282
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to do I'm going</font>

283
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,820
to show these security people i'm not

284
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,280
going to do security anymore you know

285
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,140
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not taking that mindset they</font>

286
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand right we're asking</font>

287
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to be accountable for something</font>

288
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,530
that we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bothered to stop and</font>

289
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,940
actually teach those basic lessons to

290
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">ken developers sometimes be stubborn</font>

291
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,410
sure you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll admit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but but</font>

292
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,060
but they're not they're not evil you

293
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,740
know they'll do the right thing if we

294
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,359
spend the time to instruct them and

295
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,510
teach them as far as what you know what

296
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they need to do so you know from my</font>

297
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,450
perspective when I

298
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,770
looking and working with an individual

299
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,070
organization of thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how can</font>

300
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> improve the security culture here I</font>

301
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,460
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where we have</font>

302
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,430
developers that think like security

303
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,440
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't want developers that</font>

304
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,760
think like hackers okay that's the

305
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,290
that's the buzz you know everybody

306
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,610
throws that around I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want you know</font>

307
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't teach a developer to think</font>

308
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,970
like a hacker because it to be so truly

309
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,370
think like a hacker someone from the bad

310
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,750
perspective you have to have that you

311
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,950
know I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal money I want you</font>

312
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,320
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of evil</font>

313
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,090
nature that's driving you there and so

314
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,640
I'm more about let's teach developers to

315
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,990
think like<font color="#E5E5E5"> security people doesn't mean</font>

316
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,210
they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be security experts</font>

317
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,800
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they don't all need to be</font>

318
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,170
security experts we have some of those

319
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">folks in the central security team that</font>

320
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,810
can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that support we just want</font>

321
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,150
everybody to feel like they're part of

322
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the solution and understand why why it's</font>

323
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,350
important so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I've kind of</font>

324
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,530
introduced what what I'm going to talk

325
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,420
about here you know from an RV a sec

326
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,709
perspective you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned this</font>

327
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,660
already everybody in the room your

328
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,250
organization build something right I

329
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,510
don't know what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

330
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,850
have developers that are building

331
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:55,000
products web<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps services or those</font>

332
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,920
types of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and so you</font>

333
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a need to make security a top</font>

334
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,199
priority from their perspective and you

335
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,610
know if you're here and you're

336
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">passionate about security the rest of</font>

337
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,610
this talk I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going I'm going to go into</font>

338
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,920
how can you actually build something in

339
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,360
your organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this based on</font>

340
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,189
what experience that I've had in the

341
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">past let's talk for a second about</font>

342
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,470
security culture and to do that I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

343
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,690
go to another philosopher of Silicon

344
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,700
Valley Tim Ferriss from the 4-hour

345
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,550
workweek perspective if you've ever

346
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,380
heard of him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threw out</font>

347
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,969
this definition of culture saying it's

348
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,500
he didn't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boulud that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

349
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,120
added in but he said what happens when

350
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,730
people are left to their own devices is

351
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,320
a good definition of a bajan<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric</font>

352
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,400
culture and I thought you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

353
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,990
that's kind of an interesting way to

354
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,790
think about it what if we add with

355
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,410
security in the middle you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

356
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,240
happens with security when people are

357
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,680
left to their own devices do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

358
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,570
the right decision do they make the

359
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,489
secure coding you know do they make the

360
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,740
decision that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

361
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,350
secure design of a particular feature or

362
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,150
do they say nobody's looking and I'm

363
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to take the shortest path the</font>

364
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,660
least path of resistance to getting me

365
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,189
you know out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the office at the end of</font>

366
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,900
the day

367
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,760
so application security does come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

368
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,279
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people okay that's that's one of</font>

369
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,410
my main tenants that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always focus</font>

370
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,740
on it comes down to it the problems come

371
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,270
from the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so tool vendors tend</font>

372
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,070
to disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me they tend to say</font>

373
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,839
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

374
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,460
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the right tools application</font>

375
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,860
of security is about the tool sets and

376
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,480
things and I would agree to it a more

377
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,980
minimum level yeah the tool sets are

378
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,300
important but if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

379
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,430
that know how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the tools and</font>

380
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,349
understand the concepts then the tools

381
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,829
are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not that beneficial</font>

382
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,820
to anybody and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately the people are</font>

383
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce the</font>

384
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,350
vulnerabilities and into these products

385
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and into this code anyway right I mean</font>

386
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the what are the</font>

387
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,700
two most elite things that have caused

388
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:49,130
the data breach for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a given given</font>

389
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,720
company one somebody left a laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

390
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,189
car you know we've heard a number of

391
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,900
news stories about that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there</font>

392
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">was one of the DoD or somebody had a</font>

393
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,650
left a laptop and somebody grabbed it

394
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,420
unencrypted with you know hundreds of

395
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,459
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of records or something like</font>

396
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,040
sequel injection but sequel injection

397
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,290
didn't just get planted in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> right a</font>

398
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,240
developer made a decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to use /</font>

399
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,370
amortized queries and and the things

400
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they go along with that and so they</font>

401
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,900
made a bad design decision but so it

402
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,459
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the people so why do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

403
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,140
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the security culture at</font>

404
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,609
all well we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

405
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,350
that people are making bad decisions

406
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,760
right clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy has a tattoo on</font>

407
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,339
his back says clearly I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> made some</font>

408
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,020
bad decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tattoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it all to</font>

409
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,480
itself is probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad decision right</font>

410
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,220
maybe the security process is broken or

411
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,779
doesn't even exist you know I've seen

412
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,550
places like that where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it said where I</font>

413
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,810
walk in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey I say hey</font>

414
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,790
what's your what's your secure

415
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,369
development<font color="#CCCCCC"> life cycle or it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked like</font>

416
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,630
and they say what what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that okay now I</font>

417
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">know where we have to start from that</font>

418
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">process we now I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gives me a</font>

419
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,029
good metric of your security<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture at</font>

420
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,770
that point if you don't even have you

421
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:51,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security even thought about in the</font>

422
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,270
life cycle much less implemented or

423
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,560
maybe and maybe you don't have tools or

424
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,569
you know they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and they're not</font>

425
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,500
existent you know into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your into your</font>

426
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,540
system there so when I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

427
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,339
security culture these are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

428
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,980
features that what i call the defining

429
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:09,290
features of this and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to think</font>

430
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,390
of this as a sustainable security

431
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,490
culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay security culture is some</font>

432
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,260
it takes to change it change any culture

433
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">right takes a long time it's not going</font>

434
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,670
to happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one quarter and 1</font>

435
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,750
million dollars in who we're all going

436
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,250
to be secure we're all going to be

437
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,960
security conscious know this is going to

438
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,700
take a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

439
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,200
this for the long haul you have to take

440
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,190
this this idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going to do</font>

441
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's that's going to be</font>

442
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">sustainable so in five years we're going</font>

443
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,740
to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to say wow</font>

444
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,240
remember how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we used to be how bad off</font>

445
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,120
we used to be from a process perspective

446
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,560
from a knowledge perspective and you

447
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,050
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the ability to</font>

448
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,069
really look into the you know look at

449
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,660
how good we are now to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really rock the</font>

450
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,760
boat when it comes to security culture

451
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,430
first you have to be deliberate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

452
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,760
nobody ever just you know stumbled into

453
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,140
a secure you know a secure mindset in an

454
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,340
organization it doesn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen well</font>

455
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,170
everybody woke up today and they started

456
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,760
thinking security was cool and and they

457
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,199
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the right thing here right</font>

458
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,610
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be deliberate you have to be</font>

459
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,740
disruptive<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to rock the boat</font>

460
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,900
some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if somebody is not mad at</font>

461
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,130
you as a result of the things you're

462
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,380
trying to do to change the security

463
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,550
culture you didn't go far enough right

464
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,890
you should at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least have a couple of</font>

465
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,560
angry emails and people screaming at you

466
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,150
that's a good thing in the beginning the

467
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,579
other thing is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know make it engaging</font>

468
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know too often security is</font>

469
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,660
seen as boring and you know it's just

470
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">not that not that interesting try and</font>

471
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,250
look for ways to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> your security</font>

472
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,940
culture have you no more fun be more fun

473
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,290
as security people and then from from a

474
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,030
rewarding perspective you got to find

475
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reward people right people like</font>

476
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,060
to be rewarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like to hear hey</font>

477
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a good job they like to get an</font>

478
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,270
email from their manager saying you did

479
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,830
something good<font color="#E5E5E5"> here they like to receive</font>

480
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,780
you know different benefits and things

481
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,430
so figure out how you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

482
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,260
can reward people for making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

483
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,579
decisions instead of always you know

484
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,689
we're out<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're good at slamming people</font>

485
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,120
over the head when they make the wrong

486
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,410
decision that's easy right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

487
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,480
reward them for<font color="#CCCCCC"> making the right</font>

488
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,100
decision along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

489
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,360
fourth one their return on investment

490
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,949
that's just to make the executives happy

491
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,510
you know they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what you know</font>

492
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want me to spend how much money you</font>

493
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,140
know and what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be my return on</font>

494
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:14,669
it that's that's that number that you

495
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:17,370
need for them so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go about then</font>

496
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,050
changing a security culture right

497
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">because every organization has some type</font>

498
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,740
of security culture it might be not

499
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:25,409
great it might be you know pretty decent

500
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,860
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things that we can do to</font>

501
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:32,520
you affect and impact all of our people

502
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,320
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization and so the</font>

503
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,300
first thing we can do is what i like to

504
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,220
call open their eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

505
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,080
try to open up everyone's eyes to what

506
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,880
is application<font color="#E5E5E5"> security every for</font>

507
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,730
everyone within our organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

508
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,890
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as just general awareness okay</font>

509
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,840
it's it's how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we provide them with</font>

510
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,150
those foundational things you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

511
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,129
for example standard vocabulary right

512
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,050
it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens when everybody</font>

513
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,090
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the developers in your organization</font>

514
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,250
learn what an exploit and a

515
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,320
vulnerability and at zero day and all

516
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,820
those basic things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone in the</font>

517
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,679
room here we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> those for granted we</font>

518
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,139
throw those those words around like you

519
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,140
know it's part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our vocabulary that we</font>

520
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,820
all use in our day-to-day existence the

521
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,590
average developer out there doesn't do

522
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,850
that they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they</font>

523
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> words like we do and the</font>

524
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,570
next thing that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about from a</font>

525
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,580
culture change perspective is let's fill

526
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,200
their brains with some knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

527
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,730
let's let's let's give them some

528
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,170
knowledge that's specific to what they

529
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,970
do and their job you know from you know

530
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">role specific things so developers you</font>

531
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,030
know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide them</font>

532
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,650
with you know certain additional lessons

533
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,660
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be different from what</font>

534
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,370
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask of a tester to do for</font>

535
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,090
example but fill their brains with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

536
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">knowledge of application security the</font>

537
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,389
second part that I that I list here

538
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,430
under fill their brains is this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

539
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,040
history so every organization has a

540
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,660
security history right you've had bugs

541
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,070
that have that have happened that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

542
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,080
know when you created a new product and

543
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,790
it was 10 years ago there's a number of

544
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,740
bugs that have happened over time and

545
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,350
you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a database you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

546
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,180
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine it and understand it it's</font>

547
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,830
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what are those top</font>

548
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,900
problems that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've had in</font>

549
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past so that you can have a plan for</font>

550
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">how you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to address them in the</font>

551
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">future you know don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just ignore the</font>

552
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,160
history of what happened but but roll

553
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,940
that into your idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change culture in</font>

554
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,340
your organization it's also good to use

555
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,600
specific examples you know directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

556
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,760
your products when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> teaching</font>

557
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,379
somebody about about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid a</font>

558
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,560
problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past you know in the</font>

559
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,810
future that occurred<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past if you</font>

560
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,220
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's generic it doesn't</font>

561
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,720
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as hard hitting as if you take</font>

562
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,880
an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that came right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from what</font>

563
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,230
they work on every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day because</font>

564
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
what I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice is when you do that</font>

565
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,020
you throw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in front of a</font>

566
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,879
developer of what they work on every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

567
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,750
they lean in a little bit closer because

568
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,100
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font>

569
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,750
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

570
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,129
openssl something I don't really care

571
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">about now you're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about something</font>

572
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I own and then I work on so that's</font>

573
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,449
it's important to use specific things

574
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know to help them understand making</font>

575
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,540
it roll specific you know filling their

576
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,340
brains with that knowledge this role

577
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,950
specific right you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

578
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,449
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see developers spend a</font>

579
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,920
lot of time on secure coding in java

580
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,540
right they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna they're going to</font>

581
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say this you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

582
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,010
isn't positively impacting me at all so

583
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,770
we have to keep this you know specific

584
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,560
to you know specific to what they

585
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:22,080
actually do in their day-to-day

586
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,230
perspective and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last the last</font>

587
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of this is what i like to call you</font>

588
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,560
know for directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the individuals is</font>

589
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,410
tasking their hands give them some

590
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:35,129
activities some things to do right when

591
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,200
we do traditional training and it before

592
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,520
over a six-month time after somebody

593
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,710
does a training class you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

594
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,960
curve of as they lose the knowledge that

595
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,090
they picked up and why are they losing

596
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,500
that knowledge on that type of a curve

597
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,449
because they're never they're not

598
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,010
actually putting it into use right away

599
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,200
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to teach somebody</font>

600
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,879
something make sure you have a set of

601
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,770
activities and things that can that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

602
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,290
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually then use those new skills</font>

603
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,639
and embed those new skills and encourage

604
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">them and reward them for doing that</font>

605
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,180
because then they'll do it and then

606
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,120
you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more more value out of the</font>

607
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,950
lessons that you've taught them and it

608
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,719
really cements that knowledge for them

609
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,080
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they that they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learned</font>

610
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,290
about application security communities

611
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,960
the the final<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of this this set and</font>

612
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of you know community is a place</font>

613
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">where I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we really fall down in a</font>

614
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,740
lot of internal inside of a lot of

615
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,280
organizations especially from a security

616
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,750
community perspective we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have most</font>

617
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,000
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I work with don't</font>

618
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">have gatherings like this internal to</font>

619
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,350
the company we used to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at Cisco</font>

620
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,510
I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a conference series inside</font>

621
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,429
a cisco called second that was all

622
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,050
internal and it was we had about 500

623
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,570
employees that would come<font color="#CCCCCC"> together for</font>

624
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,399
this type of a gathering all in from

625
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,409
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company but I don't think we</font>

626
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,580
do enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this community type of</font>

627
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,650
building because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a lot</font>

628
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,560
of value in people teaching each

629
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,000
they're from within a network and we're

630
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,770
good at we're good at doing that from an

631
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,720
external perspective at events like this

632
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,270
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it very good inside of</font>

633
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,680
our organizations and you know it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

634
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">as simple as doing something like a</font>

635
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,860
hackathon or whatever inside of your

636
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,350
organization but I think you have to

637
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,000
work to build security community because

638
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,550
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the foundation of this</font>

639
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,960
culture change is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know having a</font>

640
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,090
group of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are connected</font>

641
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">together that can encourage each other</font>

642
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,020
they can mentor new people and you know

643
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,350
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really see some good</font>

644
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,300
things that come out of that and so you

645
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,330
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of from a solution</font>

646
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,919
perspective you know every popular movie

647
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,419
in the last three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years there's been a</font>

648
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,400
superhero that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it saves the</font>

649
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">day unfortunately we don't have that of</font>

650
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,410
application security there's no

651
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,790
application security Batman or something

652
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,790
but but there are there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

653
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:48,960
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do to build an individual program</font>

654
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,250
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what when when I talk</font>

655
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,200
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> an application security awareness</font>

656
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,400
program this is the idea of taking all

657
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,040
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I just talked about</font>

658
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know raising awareness adding now</font>

659
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,970
you know providing knowledge and history

660
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,310
activity community putting it all

661
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,500
together so as something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that exists as</font>

662
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:08,100
a program inside of your organization

663
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,110
and so here's a way to think about kind

664
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">of where application security awareness</font>

665
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,139
fits because it kind of sounds like

666
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,160
security awareness but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really not</font>

667
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,110
security awareness I think of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

668
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's your anti-phishing</font>

669
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,860
training it's your don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> let people</font>

670
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,560
chase you in the door after you know if

671
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,330
they don't have a badge confront them

672
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,770
you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody sounds too good to</font>

673
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,810
be true on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone they probably are</font>

674
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,250
you know don't don't give the microsoft

675
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,870
support person you're all your

676
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,490
information right we've all had family

677
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,989
members we bet to take that call for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

678
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,020
know everybody in the room has at this

679
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,640
point but and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other end of</font>

680
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,200
the extreme their security training and

681
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,960
what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security training is this</font>

682
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,360
is the 40 hours where we're taking

683
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,350
somebody deeply into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of secure</font>

684
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,360
coding and so you know what what I've

685
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,949
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other people is something that</font>

686
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,649
exists kind of in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

687
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you know tradition I think a</font>

688
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,280
traditional training is it's relatively

689
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,720
boring usually you know if you think

690
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,430
about it maybe if you've done like a

691
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,460
hacking class or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

692
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,110
at a security

693
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,880
that's that's a type of a class is

694
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,469
pretty engaging but the average secure

695
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,090
coding class that we would send our

696
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,100
developers to it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not there just</font>

697
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's not going to be super enter you</font>

698
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,389
know energetic for them to do that so I

699
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,740
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this idea is how do we how do</font>

700
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,570
we provide some of that security

701
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,610
training some of the awareness across

702
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,399
the board<font color="#CCCCCC"> but do it in a form factor</font>

703
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,379
that everybody in our organization will

704
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take advantage of and we want</font>

705
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,350
to be able to tailor it for your

706
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,660
organization as well right because

707
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's certain things that that you</font>

708
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't talk about that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

709
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,840
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you know just a standard</font>

710
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,129
secure coding training class it's not

711
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be tailored</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> towards the</font>

712
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,830
problems that you've had in the past so

713
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,690
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of summarize a</font>

714
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,820
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about what the benefits</font>

715
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,260
are doing at this type of a program you

716
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,419
know everybody gets that foundational

717
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,830
knowledge of application security but

718
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,300
with a minimal investment right we're

719
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">not asking buddy to sit in a training</font>

720
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,990
class<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for a week because you know in</font>

721
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the average organization that doesn't</font>

722
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,110
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I mean I wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told you i</font>

723
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,000
was at<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

724
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,830
somewhere around twenty-five or thirty

725
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,080
thousand developers you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could</font>

726
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">get even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent of those people</font>

727
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,480
into a one week long class in a given

728
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,360
calendar year not a chance one percent

729
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,830
is what out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that you know 250 people</font>

730
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,750
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could probably get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

731
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,490
maybe out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the year but it's just not</font>

732
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way development cycles work in big</font>

733
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,820
companies right you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to take</font>

734
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,560
everybody because if you start adding up

735
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,340
the man years that go to that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

736
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,740
they that starts to break down you know

737
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,270
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a defined mission you know from</font>

738
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,680
security activities and then you know

739
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,620
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back around with that community</font>

740
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:44,440
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to tell you it for the</font>

741
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,179
rest of the time here is you know I

742
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't work for cisco anymore now but I</font>

743
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,760
built a program like this that I've been

744
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,110
describing inside the walls of cisco and

745
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,750
you know they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

746
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:58,120
some degree so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm about to share</font>

747
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,620
here is based on lessons learned over

748
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,750
five years of building one of these

749
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and you know creating it and</font>

750
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:10,090
watching it grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> and blossom and it at</font>

751
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:12,429
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> count that program had touched a</font>

752
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,260
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people within Cisco so it had</font>

753
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,730
gone viral within the company and and

754
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,290
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were getting into security</font>

755
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,800
training without being<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced which is</font>

756
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:21,290
you know the ultimate goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

757
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,879
type of security culture change event if

758
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,620
you can get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump in and do it</font>

759
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,030
without someone twisting their arm then

760
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,060
you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way you're</font>

761
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,139
almost all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got going</font>

762
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to break this down into four different</font>

763
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,710
pieces right there's program

764
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,389
architecture there's content or how you

765
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,220
can go about actually connecting with

766
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,200
the people you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach there is</font>

767
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,540
the idea of how do we mix in some humor

768
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,760
and some story and some fun into our

769
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,740
content so it's not just boring talking

770
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,640
about sequel injection for six hours in

771
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">a row and then one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the new kind</font>

772
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pop things in the world of everything</font>

773
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,500
gamification right how do we add some

774
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:59,330
game like things into our learning

775
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,540
environment of security to try and get

776
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">people more engaged so the first phase</font>

777
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:08,149
here is our program architecture phase

778
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,590
and in this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we want to we</font>

779
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,600
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just work out some design</font>

780
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,129
decisions for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because</font>

781
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to document what's</font>

782
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,940
going on and the way that we I think the

783
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,800
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I'd recommend to people to</font>

784
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,390
start this is you have to step back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

785
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,490
assess your security culture and look

786
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see what you have at this point you</font>

787
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,500
know do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a secure development</font>

788
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifecycle can people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spell security in</font>

789
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,180
the organization you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

790
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,340
go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the best way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

791
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,410
you know focus groups that are cross you

792
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,750
know gonna cross section of the entire

793
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,610
organization interviewing people you

794
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,870
know I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just walk up and ask people</font>

795
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,490
sometimes someone that I didn't even

796
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,330
know you know because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know them</font>

797
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,710
already they know where you're coming

798
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,300
from they'll think they might give you

799
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,530
the answer you want to hear but just in

800
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,210
the lunchroom you know so what do you

801
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,340
know about you know building secure

802
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,140
products here see what they say you know

803
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,780
but go through that assessment process

804
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,640
because that'll really help you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

805
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,470
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of decisions a lot of these next</font>

806
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,140
few decisions and you want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

807
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,630
you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know acting without</font>

808
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,730
data for the decisions that you have to

809
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,130
make because really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing of</font>

810
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,170
the next big thing here is you know what

811
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,330
is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that exists in your</font>

812
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:18,470
organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will come out of</font>

813
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the assessment here does is there</font>

814
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not a lot of application security</font>

815
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,980
knowledge you know do people not even

816
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,690
understand threats do we have a process

817
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,770
but people don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they</font>

818
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,500
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they're supposed to</font>

819
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,269
do with it is their motivation you know

820
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,469
do we lack motivation to improve

821
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,820
security in the organization what's the

822
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:37,759
problem that's that's what you have to

823
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,200
to really figure out here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

824
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a solution to do that we</font>

825
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,849
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we know building a</font>

826
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,408
team so you can't do this obviously as

827
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:49,039
an individual it's very difficult to do

828
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:51,019
by yourself and this is a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

829
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">you there are other passionate security</font>

830
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,539
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your organization so if you</font>

831
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,559
leave here today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say you know</font>

832
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,999
what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

833
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,889
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this inside of my company</font>

834
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,149
there's other passionate security people

835
00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:00,830
and you probably could list them right

836
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:03,199
now the five people that you could reach

837
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:06,049
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say I got this crazy idea I</font>

838
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,729
need your help<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know they'll jump</font>

839
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:08,779
in and be willing to help you whether

840
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:12,229
that means they're going to help you

841
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:14,149
create content or review content or just

842
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:16,129
act<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a subject matter expert you know</font>

843
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:18,039
there's there's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

844
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:20,509
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you can approach it there</font>

845
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:22,609
one other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on building a team in</font>

846
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,769
that so when I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this at Cisco I</font>

847
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:26,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am NOT a training learning and</font>

848
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,769
development person right I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in</font>

849
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:29,749
the security business forever I didn't

850
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:31,459
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I didn't know in that</font>

851
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:33,259
world but I did learn that there's these

852
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:34,879
people called psychometricians which has

853
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:36,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to be the coolest almost the coolest</font>

854
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:39,079
job description business card you could

855
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,729
have there but they're experts in the

856
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,229
learning process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's somebody that</font>

857
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:44,509
you can lean on here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should</font>

858
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:47,690
make part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your core team to to figure</font>

859
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:48,769
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know it's for example</font>

860
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,079
it's really hard to write an assessment

861
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:52,849
question no it's easy to write an

862
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,589
assessment question it's hard to write a

863
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:56,149
good fair assessment question if you've

864
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:57,109
ever taken a certification test right

865
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:58,758
there's always that question where

866
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:00,349
you're like now I disagree let me talk

867
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the author you know what will</font>

868
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:03,769
straighten it out that's what these

869
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:05,209
psychometrician people do is help you

870
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:08,629
kind of ensure you're doing the right

871
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:11,089
thing they're a big part of having a

872
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:12,978
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> program here is you got it</font>

873
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:14,418
you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose a theme okay it's got</font>

874
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:17,179
to be something fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people can get</font>

875
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:19,489
in gate get engaged with and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

876
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:21,739
fun with<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco i used the idea of</font>

877
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:24,469
security ninjas<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that allowed me it</font>

878
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:26,809
was it was almost too easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I borrowed</font>

879
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:29,269
the idea from Adobe but it allowed me to

880
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:31,158
have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of graphics created and</font>

881
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:33,799
and visuals and things and just

882
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertised and what we found is</font>

883
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,799
everybody wanted to be a security ninja

884
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,119
because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they thought</font>

885
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,168
it sounded cool the average developer

886
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,478
said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kyle sounds kind of cool i</font>

887
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:43,929
want to be a security ninja so the theme

888
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:46,130
drew them in to want to do the training

889
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:48,290
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations that</font>

890
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,730
that name maybe doesn't work that's you

891
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,110
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work for you what about</font>

892
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,940
you know you could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

893
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,250
apprentice followed by a security

894
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,110
journeyman and kind of use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

895
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,000
school craftsman perspective of

896
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,800
describing somebody's to you know

897
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,660
capabilities you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could even use a</font>

898
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,860
nautical theme you know if but that the

899
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,090
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

900
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,620
something that everybody in your

901
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:08,600
organization if there's something that's

902
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,979
in your organizational culture already

903
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like and are excited about</font>

904
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,750
take advantage of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it just</font>

905
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of comes out in that assessment as</font>

906
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,950
well you know stay away from anything

907
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:23,270
controversial obviously it'll cause HR

908
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:25,570
to be chasing you around and another the

909
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:28,670
second very important design decision is

910
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,350
people want individual levels in a

911
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,050
system like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they don't want to</font>

912
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:36,290
take 140 our class to be done they want

913
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:38,149
to be able to see a journey that exists

914
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,950
across this type of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> training program</font>

915
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:43,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and this gives you a very rough</font>

916
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,840
idea of what I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco everybody</font>

917
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,000
wanted to be a black belt a security

918
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,159
black belt but what they could see in

919
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,190
the program as we built it up is that

920
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,900
they started to learn some content

921
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">passed some assessments that got them a</font>

922
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,770
white belt they got excited they got

923
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,860
recognized they got pumped up about it

924
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">then they went on to you know becoming a</font>

925
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,840
yellow belt and moving on up the chain

926
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,270
here but the levels really do cause

927
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,639
someone to be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see you know if I</font>

928
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,830
start here I can end here and here's the

929
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,780
mark marking posts along the road for me

930
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:18,770
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this other spot so that's very</font>

931
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:23,060
beneficial to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> people engaged rolls</font>

932
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:24,760
so what are the detailed roles that you

933
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,830
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go after in your organization</font>

934
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,540
you know my advice is never to start

935
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,159
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire chart and try to create</font>

936
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that captures all these people</font>

937
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,270
pick the most and the one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

938
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">most people at cisco we started with the</font>

939
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,240
software engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there were</font>

940
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,650
more of them than anybody else so we

941
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,330
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go with the law</font>

942
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,890
of averages and see if we have a bigger

943
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,840
population we can get more people

944
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,280
engaged in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but you know you may have</font>

945
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,500
even even other things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

946
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,240
listed<font color="#CCCCCC"> here my point one of the other</font>

947
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,040
points here is that this there isn't

948
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,540
everyone role here right this is

949
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,120
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone should get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

950
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,290
least a small piece of regardless of

951
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,760
what they do in the company even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font>

952
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:01,260
never touch code you know so

953
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,750
people always they wonder you know why

954
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,200
would you put sales up there it's when

955
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,920
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> salespeople have knowledge</font>

956
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,080
foundational knowledge of your

957
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,670
application security practices they can

958
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,080
use that while there while they're

959
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,580
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a customer when a customer</font>

960
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked them a wild question about you</font>

961
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,550
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't anything about security yeah</font>

962
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,959
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this thing called a secure</font>

963
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:21,180
development lifecycle they're not going

964
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an expert in it no but you can at</font>

965
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,160
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can have a basic foundational</font>

966
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,420
knowledge they're so so design decision

967
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">three is to figure out what are the</font>

968
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,400
roles I want to go after here that are

969
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,850
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be part of my program and then</font>

970
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,960
design the design decision for is

971
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,580
activities<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to mention</font>

972
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,930
here one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them one of the things that</font>

973
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,520
I do with this level<font color="#E5E5E5"> system is usually</font>

974
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,900
the first three levels that's where

975
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,790
we're going to give you knowledge we're

976
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,710
going to provide you facts and let you

977
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,060
watch videos and things but when you get

978
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,500
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> brown and black belt level</font>

979
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,690
you've got to start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for</font>

980
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,220
security in the organization and that's

981
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,130
where these activities comes in and be

982
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,290
and behaviors so what we what we do is

983
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,790
we provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very high level set of</font>

984
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:06,210
activities for that people can actually

985
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,680
go after and do you might look at that

986
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,480
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well that's just it's way too</font>

987
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,668
high level yeah that's done on<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose</font>

988
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,440
right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really care I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

989
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,629
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody about you know</font>

990
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,649
what they're calling their activity I'm

991
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:18,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">just interested in fact they're going to</font>

992
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:20,310
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make security better so</font>

993
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,710
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a system</font>

994
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,210
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to provide points and then you</font>

995
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,679
know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that brown and black belt you</font>

996
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,179
get a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of points you get a</font>

997
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,409
brown belt certain number of points you

998
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,149
get a black belt whatever you call the

999
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,639
levels but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually put people</font>

1000
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:34,080
to work doing things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're almost</font>

1001
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,730
tricking them into improving security

1002
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,350
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're thinking their</font>

1003
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,090
motivation is I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that that</font>

1004
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,210
next belt in this system so i can be

1005
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,280
recognized and be rewarded but they're

1006
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,480
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> making you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security better</font>

1007
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,760
by what those activities that they do

1008
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,770
recognition comes into this a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1009
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,899
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a big fan of doing that</font>

1010
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,610
that you can use to recognize people

1011
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,710
that participate in this program with

1012
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,960
you you can do something with lanyards

1013
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:04,440
you can do something with you know

1014
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,320
individual certificates sending emails i

1015
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,600
find that cold hard cash is a good way

1016
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to reward the average person you know at</font>

1017
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,990
least in America

1018
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:19,310
it's funny though but that other parts

1019
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:21,410
of the world the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificates are</font>

1020
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,540
almost worth more than money<font color="#CCCCCC"> like in</font>

1021
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:26,960
India and in China other places that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1022
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I've done this for I would travel</font>

1023
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,970
to to our offices<font color="#CCCCCC"> in bangalore india and</font>

1024
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,680
I'd walk down through the hallway you

1025
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,240
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there'd be cubes on all the sides</font>

1026
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would see these certificates</font>

1027
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,959
hanging up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the cubes you know and it</font>

1028
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,759
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

1029
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,410
cultural thing that they were it was

1030
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,850
they were more<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in being able</font>

1031
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,140
to show off the fact that they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1032
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,850
knowledge now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never saw them in</font>

1033
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,750
America but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just something</font>

1034
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:52,549
that was cultural so this you know

1035
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,869
budget and schedule this question always

1036
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,090
comes up how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it cost to do</font>

1037
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:57,619
this well anything from 0 to 5 million

1038
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:00,740
dollars basically you know however much

1039
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:02,240
you want to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it this type of a</font>

1040
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,040
program to build it it does take whole

1041
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,118
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's not something that</font>

1042
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,170
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I'm going to work</font>

1043
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three months and we're</font>

1044
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,560
going to deploy this whole thing out

1045
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,810
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be good to go right it's</font>

1046
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,029
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to you know you</font>

1047
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,890
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of expect it's going to</font>

1048
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:18,560
take a while so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then when we started to</font>

1049
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,569
talk about content so I'm a big fan of

1050
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,200
doing something doing this type of

1051
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:26,600
knowledge via video because it it goes

1052
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,759
you know worldwide you know it doesn't

1053
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">require me to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1054
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,930
once it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be recorded and then it can</font>

1055
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,369
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed out throughout</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font>

1056
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,839
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also took a very different i still</font>

1057
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:38,440
take a very different approach to doing

1058
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,880
this type of content I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1059
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,730
conversational and unscripted security

1060
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,710
contact the worst training you'll ever

1061
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,570
hear is where you you can tell the

1062
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,359
person that's being recorded is reading

1063
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,950
off the teleprompter and that's exactly

1064
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,720
what the training<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like for the</font>

1065
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,890
entire time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into it</font>

1066
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,410
you're like I wish this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just end</font>

1067
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:59,180
so what I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if I put two security</font>

1068
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,430
or two or three security experts in

1069
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,859
front of a camera and we start having a

1070
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,868
conversation about a particular topic we

1071
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:07,490
get into the conversation you know and

1072
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:08,960
then the audience kind of gets into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1073
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,939
too because why do people watch

1074
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,200
late-night talk shows because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want</font>

1075
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,180
to watching people being interviewed

1076
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,890
stuff you know so you can use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1077
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,589
type of a process from your content

1078
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,509
perspective you've got to do assessments

1079
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,609
to check people to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that they</font>

1080
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:25,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do the they actually are</font>

1081
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:25,640
getting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> corky learning things that</font>

1082
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,740
you want

1083
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,720
take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from these videos I never made</font>

1084
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,118
these very hard it wasn't designed to

1085
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,890
for someone to prove PhD knowledge in

1086
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,829
application security I just wanted them

1087
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know at least prove that they you</font>

1088
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:41,329
know watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> the video or you know</font>

1089
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:43,010
understood the concept and then it's

1090
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:46,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">always good to provide resources as well</font>

1091
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,599
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

1092
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,910
always have people that want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dive</font>

1093
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">deeper into the topic might be ten</font>

1094
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:53,390
percent out of the full out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the</font>

1095
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,039
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there'll be some</font>

1096
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,078
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to dive in so give them</font>

1097
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,359
some other channels to dive deeper into

1098
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,140
a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> topic that you approve of</font>

1099
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,848
and you like and this this level one

1100
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,230
right here this this shows you what I

1101
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,640
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend at least as a</font>

1102
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:11,750
beginning point from a Content

1103
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:13,250
perspective so I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

1104
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,680
security fundamentals being the

1105
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,809
vocabulary I think it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach</font>

1106
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">people about just generally the attacks</font>

1107
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:20,359
and attackers that are out there why

1108
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,430
would someone want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break into our</font>

1109
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,319
products and it shouldn't be generic

1110
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,328
right it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be specific to your</font>

1111
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:27,529
organization as far as why would

1112
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:30,170
somebody want to break in is say you

1113
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:32,000
make a mobile banking app why would

1114
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,309
somebody want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break into our app make</font>

1115
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,930
that content specific to your world not

1116
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:38,440
generic to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person can</font>

1117
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:40,700
look at ago that doesn't apply to me

1118
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,500
security myths is always a fun one to do

1119
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,779
like a Mythbusters kind of thing with

1120
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,269
you know all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that we as</font>

1121
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:49,309
security people know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and love when</font>

1122
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:50,660
people say like oh we have a firewall

1123
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:52,880
we're protected you know that's a great

1124
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,859
one to always e is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists it's</font>

1125
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,559
crazy that even in 2016 that still

1126
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:59,569
exists out there then when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1127
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,640
that level<font color="#E5E5E5"> two this is what I showed is</font>

1128
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:03,950
my yellow belt on my leveling thing here

1129
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,500
now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go deeper okay we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1130
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,419
you know that white belt we talked about

00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,879
to start providing some specific things

into how you mitigate a sequel injection

turning it off they don't you know

1148
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,870
that's that's beyond what they want to

deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this quickly is just a</font>

1150
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,350
perspective on how I've developed

1151
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,670
content in the past and how I recommend

1152
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:56,960
people that you know want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

1153
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:58,460
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> content it's important to you</font>

1154
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,470
know obviously start with that outline

1155
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,450
but the instructional design that's the

1156
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,370
that's that psychometrician person that

1157
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,040
has knowledge of how learning works of

1158
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:09,109
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've found so many different</font>

1159
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,550
times where they've suggested changes

1160
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,810
that I just I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't understand</font>

1161
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,850
why you'd want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but when I see</font>

1162
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,650
the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> product it's because they know</font>

1163
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,330
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people learn different ways right</font>

1164
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,800
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn by hearing some by seeing</font>

1165
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,810
somebody doing that there's a whole

1166
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">science to it so that's why you see them</font>

1167
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,490
appear here twice you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

1168
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,350
from outline to making some slides doing

1169
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,149
a technical review they come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at</font>

1170
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,279
the end just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check those final slides</font>

1171
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:33,230
so when I do those video modules I use

1172
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,850
slides in the backdrop just just so I

1173
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,100
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't sit there and talk for 10</font>

1174
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,900
hours in a row so we can we can scope

1175
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,880
down an individual topic and the slides

1176
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,870
we just can kind of keep us honest as we

1177
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,460
go through humor and story I mean this

1178
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,839
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about how do we add a little</font>

1179
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,850
bit of humor how do we get people to

1180
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,770
chuckle as they're doing as they're

1181
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:54,529
going through our content you know let's

1182
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,420
let's let's make some crazy videos that

1183
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,710
are Saturday Night Live<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask and put them</font>

1184
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,290
you know with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right amount of</font>

1185
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,930
tameness but include them right inside

1186
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our content you know because we want</font>

1187
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,620
our learners to as they're watching the

1188
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,210
content we also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be thinking</font>

1189
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,160
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they going to do next what</font>

1190
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,080
could these crazy people possibly do and

1191
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,549
then they're they're engaged with the

1192
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,290
content because it's not just boring

1193
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:18,500
security talk there's there's craziness

1194
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:20,029
happening as well you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1195
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an example you can do this with us</font>

1196
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,630
something as simple as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a still cartoon</font>

1197
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:26,180
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them in the past where we just</font>

1198
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,830
use still cartoons and voiceovers right

1199
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's real cheap to do that you</font>

1200
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,770
could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your average laptop</font>

1201
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:36,080
you don't need a production studio to do

1202
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:37,850
that you can do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a big fan</font>

1203
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,000
of spoofing you know we've spoofed

1204
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:42,049
individual movies with kind of a

1205
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,300
security take you know we did a whole

1206
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,460
office space set of these little blooper

1207
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,400
kind of things if you're old<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to</font>

1208
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:51,680
remember that movie but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's</font>

1209
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a way to add some fun into the mix</font>

1210
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,690
and you know make it so it's not so

1211
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,220
boring and stodgy for people now the one

1212
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,450
word of caution this slide makes even

1213
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,919
more sense now that the Deadpool movie

1214
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:06,290
has come out not everybody thinks the

1215
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,740
same things are funny okay so you have

1216
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stay at a PG level for your any of</font>

1217
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,759
these funny little cartoons and stuff

1218
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,880
you want to put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I had a script</font>

1219
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,770
writer who wrote some<font color="#E5E5E5"> content for us for</font>

1220
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,660
a series we were going to include inside

1221
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,250
of some modules and I got this thing

1222
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,069
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I breeding thread I'm going if</font>

1223
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:27,349
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> record these I will be fired from this</font>

1224
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:29,960
company I mean it was r-rated I mean it

1225
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:32,170
was it was a comedy writer it was great

1226
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,490
stuff it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was hilarious but I was like</font>

1227
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,930
I'll be fired if we record this so I had

1228
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,640
to ask him<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say yeah can you make this</font>

1229
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,440
a little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> disney you know maybe like</font>

1230
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,940
a little you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know come down towards PG</font>

1231
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,700
you know ours a little too risky for

1232
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,520
corporate HR so just be careful you know

1233
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,799
with some caution there gamification how

1234
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,569
do we make how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make stuff fun and</font>

1235
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,500
engaging for the learner here along the

1236
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:56,299
way you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have you know you</font>

1237
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,190
can use people use badges and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1238
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:59,809
see this you know if you use any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1239
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,970
code Academy or any of those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1240
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:03,710
sites where they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know where</font>

1241
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,598
you can do different training classes

1242
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:09,349
and things everybody's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of captured</font>

1243
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,450
on to this this concept but it's just a

1244
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:13,460
way you know use badges you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1245
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a big fan of using the belts and</font>

1246
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,880
levels as a way for and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all part</font>

1247
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,259
of the gamification story here too i

1248
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,150
mean gamification doesn't mean you have

1249
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">a video game that exists in the middle</font>

1250
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,089
of your training or something it just

1251
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:26,000
means you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use video game</font>

1252
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">techniques and stuff to you know to</font>

1253
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,559
capture and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people engaged and one</font>

1254
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,780
of the greatest sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've had for</font>

1255
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:35,000
this is actually my 18 year old son who

1256
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,549
plays far too many video games according

1257
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,010
to me but he actually has a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1258
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:41,630
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> of gamification because he</font>

1259
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,160
can relate when i started when i<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

1260
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,650
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type of stuff with him he can</font>

1261
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,240
take his experience as a gamer and help

1262
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,190
me to understand a little bit about how

1263
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,689
gamification can work because he's got

1264
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,520
more experience in it so there's

1265
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,960
interesting places you can get you know

1266
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of experience from from the</font>

gamification side another place<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

1268
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,720
do more gamification it's just in the

1269
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interface you know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1272
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,040
no use every piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> real estate that</font>

1273
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,509
your program has if you have a website

00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,860
where people can click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the videos</font>

1275
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,470
don't just give them a list of video

1276
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:18,590
links to click on right embed your theme

why but human nature i guess but but

1282
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,300
include your theme in this and include

1283

this you know into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your overall user</font>

1285
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:38,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">as as gamification as well as provide a</font>

1286
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:39,710
dashboard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font>

1287

<font color="#E5E5E5">that you shouldn't think about in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1288
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,470
beginning of launching this type of a

1289
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,200
program but when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two or</font>

1290
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:47,689
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years in make a dashboard and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1291
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,779
that dashboard have a data dump of all

1292
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,490
of the execs and show how many people

1293
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,230
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at each level and make it</font>

1294
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,970
sortable and make it accessible to

1295
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody in the whole company okay</font>

1296
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you know that executives are not</font>

1297
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually competitive people amongst their</font>

1298
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,740
peers right they're usually very docile

1299
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:05,630
and you know no I'm it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that you</font>

1300
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,979
know George is better than no right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1301
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,480
show them hey you know what this other

1302
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,670
executive is doing a lot better than you

1303
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,869
and they got their ops director on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1304
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,810
phone right away you know why are they

1305
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:15,859
better than us in this you know so

1306
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:18,200
competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just another way you can</font>

1307
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:21,020
spawn you know some interest and getting

1308
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,640
people excited about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff so</font>

1309
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,259
I guess from a key takeaways you know

1310
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,879
the first one you everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here</font>

1311
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,650
already knew about the impact of

1312
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,410
vulnerabilities you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our own</font>

1313
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,910
developers perspective think about

1314
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:34,220
changing security culture you know

1315
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">opening eyes filling brains tasking</font>

1316
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:40,189
hands giving people you know a knowledge

1317
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:41,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what what they can do there and then</font>

1318
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,950
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four different pieces of an</font>

1319
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,990
application security awareness program

1320
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:47,600
from the architecture into the content

1321
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:49,310
into the including humor making a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1322
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,040
bit of fun mixed into this and then

1323
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,170
adding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gamification principles and I</font>

1324
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,180
guess my call to action here is that you

1325
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,130
know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that any size</font>

1326
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,960
organization can do right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

1327
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,369
this as you can do this as one<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

1328
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,510
it's going to be really small you know

1329
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:04,070
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning you're gonna have to</font>

1330
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">find some partners in different parts of</font>

1331
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the business to help you along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

1332
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:09,830
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can definitely build your own</font>

1333
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,300
and I would encourage anybody that's

1334
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:13,580
even thinking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to dive in</font>

1335
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,010
and pilot you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> create one or two</font>

1336
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,170
videos and see what happens you know

1337
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,160
maybe it'll do like the program we had

1338
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,900
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco did where we</font>

1339
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,279
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first belt and we SAT back</font>

1340
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,310
thinking nobody's probably ever going to

1341
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,140
watch this you know within a couple of

1342
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,520
months we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had gone</font>

1343
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,500
through it because it just caught fire

1344
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,720
people got interested in doing it so

1345
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,160
crazy things can happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I didn't</font>

1346
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to build the whole thing first I</font>

1347
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,859
could build a small piece release it and

1348
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,730
let it out there so your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers and</font>

1349
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,250
everyone else in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company will</font>

1350
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,080
ultimately thank you for forgiving

1351
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,780
application security the right amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1352
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:50,870
attention so with that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I have</font>

1353
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:53,290
what 32 seconds for lightning<font color="#E5E5E5"> round</font>

1354
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,290
question
