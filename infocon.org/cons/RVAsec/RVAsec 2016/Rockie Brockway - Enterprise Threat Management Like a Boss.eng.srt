wrote or co-authored a document called

14

the enterprise security blueprint and

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,190
essentially is a blueprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

into how most organizations really

should be looking at enterprise security

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,158
architecture a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of eye candy my</font>

this is an uptick graph which is from

the

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">and DVR over the same amount of time so</font>

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,480
what I see here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're spending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:46,940
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money and probably in the wrong</font>

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,649
places because if we're spending all

46
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,930
this money and IT and information

47
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,290
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know theoretically on paper</font>

48
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,930
those numbers should begin to go down so

49
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,870
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this most organizations in my</font>

50
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,930
experience have or are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

51
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,870
information security in one of two ways

52
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,840
and unfortunately those ways are kind of

53
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,970
flawed the first is from a

54
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,040
project-by-project basis in other words

55
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to refresh my infrastructure I</font>

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,810
need a new firewall I need to buy the

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest buzz word because the CEO read it</font>

58
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,269
in a industry magazine the second way is

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,980
they're looking at the security program

60
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,810
from a compliance perspective now all

61
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,750
the old school security nerds like me

62
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:34,340
are always going to say if you're

63
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:37,220
compliant you're not secure but if

64
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,560
you're secure then you're also going to

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,200
be compliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to whatever compliance</font>

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,959
framework whether that's a regulatory

67
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,310
you know federally regulated framework

68
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,940
or whether that's something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST</font>

69
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,680
cybersecurity and things of that nature

70
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,549
but the reality is this right you know

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,620
the data is critical to the financial

72
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,480
viability of your business and therefore

73
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,890
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be treated as a function the</font>

74
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection of that data must be treated</font>

75
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:09,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a function of the business so enter</font>

76
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:13,149
architecture right architecture is you

77
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,739
know a framework that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is intended to</font>

78
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,829
simplify the management of very

79
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,510
complicated systems our organizations

80
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,150
and businesses are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated</font>

81
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,580
systems so therefore basing your program

82
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,590
on security and specifically from an

83
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,710
architecture perspective makes complete

84
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:35,080
sense to me some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the benefits that</font>

85
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,520
you get while you know that you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,419
implementing a security program<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on</font>

87
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,880
architecture are things such as metrics

88
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:46,529
metrics is very important there was a

89
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,579
great talk yesterday that

90
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,289
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

91
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:53,129
metrics but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day</font>

92
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,529
metrics that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably most of</font>

93
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,059
you in here the technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> or security</font>

94
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,919
side of the house that's how we

95
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:01,819
communicate back up into the business

96
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,349
the business they're not technical

97
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,999
people right but they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

98
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:07,739
where the budget needs to be focused on

99
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:10,139
they need to know what the priorities

100
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:13,229
are and so through architecture we have

101
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,519
the ability to communicate those

102
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:20,159
priorities back into the business so

103
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,719
architecture here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go today I'm going</font>

104
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about threat management</font>

105
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:27,058
but this is really kind of the you know

106
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:30,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the intro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the talk architecture mmm</font>

107
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:33,359
this model again from 2007 which is

108
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,579
completely relevant today takes your

109
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:39,058
enterprise security architecture and and

110
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,939
and and shows that we have three primary

111
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:44,489
pillars risk management<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy standards</font>

112
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:47,429
and then actual design architecture

113
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:51,289
itself those three pillars are supported

114
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:55,169
in some way shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> or form by process our</font>

115
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:57,029
typical controls which are considered

116
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:59,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense-in-depth right your endpoint</font>

117
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,259
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network security etc and</font>

118
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:04,949
then metrics like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just mentioned</font>

119
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:07,919
within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process side of the house</font>

120
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,509
this is where I've been focusing quite a

121
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,599
bit over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few years with a</font>

122
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:14,849
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our clients last year I did a</font>

123
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,069
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar talk but on enterprise</font>

124
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,869
class vulnerability management like a

125
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:21,749
boss this year I've been spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

126
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:24,899
of time working with organizations from

127
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:27,359
a sock monitoring perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIR</font>

128
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:30,419
perspective so this year I'm doing

129
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:32,938
threat management like a boss so let's

130
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,269
figure this out you know the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

131
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:39,539
management process itself is typically

132
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:41,249
broken down into these types of you know

133
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,919
these types of controls and processes

134
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:47,069
etc threat modeling Incident Response

135
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,169
the buzzword threat intelligence does

136
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:53,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody know who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Norse is raise your</font>

137
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:55,649
hand does anybody know whether today

138
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,179
they're bankrupt they don't exist

139
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,969
anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a very interesting</font>

140
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:02,479
example of

141
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:07,269
threat intelligence that got a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

142
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,279
funding but didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any contact so</font>

143
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:12,979
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> our challenges here okay so if</font>

144
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,229
we start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basics we have we have</font>

145
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,860
Moore's law right so malware is evolving

146
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:22,128
at an equal speed Moore's law every 18

147
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,099
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> our processing power doubles okay</font>

148
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:28,639
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that to deal with the</font>

149
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:31,659
intelligence issue you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

150
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,979
know about trends we have to know about

151
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,869
actors we have to know about incentive

152
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,489
and motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's I'll get into</font>

153
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:39,799
that this in a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> while but that's</font>

154
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:41,318
threat modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there are</font>

155
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:46,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways that we can go about</font>

156
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:49,549
actually modeling who might be motivated

157
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,429
enough and incentivize enough to steal

158
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:55,909
something from you right and threat

159
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:57,558
modeling communication obviously we need

160
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,479
to be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to communicate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

161
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:02,299
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business right who needs to</font>

162
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,188
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved at what point etc the</font>

163
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:06,078
communication between inter processes

164
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:07,729
right vulnerability management and

165
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,459
threat management are completely

166
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,068
different areas but the von side of the

167
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,599
house needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate</font>

168
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">data over to the threat side of the</font>

169
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:20,089
house the same you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and vice versa</font>

170
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:22,699
so communication is is is exceptionally

171
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:25,309
important here that then goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand in</font>

172
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with coordination and and</font>

173
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:30,499
accountability we have you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

174
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:33,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">some level of accountability at every</font>

175
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:36,979
step and every level of these types of

176
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:40,490
processes we have incident response that

177
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,139
may span multiple business units within

178
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,209
your organization right who's

179
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:47,779
accountable for each one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas</font>

180
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:50,959
and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of because of that</font>

181
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:53,930
accountability they have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

182
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:59,029
have to have already bought in on the

183
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:01,550
incident response process itself so more

184
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:03,649
importantly there was a report recently

185
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,649
not recently in 2012<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to read this</font>

186
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:10,130
here the massive here's here's the big

187
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:12,649
issue right we have all of these

188
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,139
fantastic next generation

189
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:18,110
firewalls and intrusion detection and

190
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,720
endpoint controls that are throwing gobs

191
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,720
and gobs and gobs of information at us

192
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,559
right so it's from a threat management /

193
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,369
side of the house it's our

194
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:31,009
responsibility to analyze that and be

195
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:33,319
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess an appropriate course of</font>

196
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:35,389
action based on the input right so what

197
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:39,410
are what are they going to be our

198
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:41,449
outcomes this sense in 2012 report

199
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,149
showed that the massive and mostly

200
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:46,609
manual effort of collecting and

201
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,459
analyzing security data has caused a

202
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,350
severe downturn in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mood of security</font>

203
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,160
teams as well as the perception of their

204
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:58,970
effectiveness by stakeholders that's a

205
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,649
problem that's such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that that</font>

206
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,699
report no longer exists on the internet

207
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:07,429
it's a dead link that's so I and I was

208
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:10,719
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> too lazy to go to you know the</font>

209
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web archive to define the line but</font>

210
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,100
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to keep this way this has to be</font>

211
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:18,499
you know bearing in mind as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we move</font>

212
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,980
through all this because if any of you

213
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:25,189
have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that I've seen</font>

214
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:31,059
right if you've seen the things I've

215
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:34,099
seen etc from all of you know the

216
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:37,219
vectors the actors right the response

217
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:41,179
the lack of accountability this is what

218
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:46,100
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop</font>

219
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:48,439
a maturity exercise right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

220
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,509
we're I'm going to do the way I'm going

221
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about this is you know from a</font>

222
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:55,639
I'm going to actually just skip this

223
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,920
right we know we have goals right so

224
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,350
what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually really dive into</font>

225
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,469
here is is anybody is anybody familiar

226
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,540
with the application security

227
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,720
verification standard it's an OAuth

228
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:14,329
framework for application development

229
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:17,600
anyone a couple people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay owasp the</font>

230
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:21,079
2014 version and there's a there now at

231
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,830
version 3 of that 2014 documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

232
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:28,370
framework what this is is a

233
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,770
real world way to manage and and and you

234
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,000
know determine the maturity of your

235
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:36,079
software development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle an</font>

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,430
application development process<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it</font>

237
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,130
is an implementable framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas</font>

238
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,890
the OWASP top 20 here are all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

239
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and what not</font>

240
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:54,230
was fairly unimplemented in my opinion

241
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:56,120
as a techie right so it breaks things

242
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,460
down into four levels but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

243
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,600
level is level<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero meaning I don't want</font>

244
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,550
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care I don't want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

245
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,320
it that means you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really doing</font>

246
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:09,439
anything of interest so levels one two

247
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">and three of the ASV s essentially</font>

248
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,200
breaks things down very very simply and

249
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,990
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> even put it out as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open source</font>

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,610
Excel spreadsheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now you can</font>

251
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,400
basically say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay section for</font>

252
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,680
authentication you know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

253
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,949
these types of controls in place are

254
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,810
they okay then if not then collectively

255
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,950
you are going to fall into level 1 level

256
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,569
2 or level three level 1 being okay you

257
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,570
probably need a bunch of work level two

258
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:43,070
is typically a great goal for most

259
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:45,380
verticals unless you are in critical

260
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,380
infrastructure or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that affects</font>

261
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,080
human life<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's really now we're</font>

262
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,000
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three needs to be your</font>

263
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,690
organization needs to to move towards

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,970
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three so the intent here and again</font>

265
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,850
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> software do like lifecycle or</font>

266
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:05,450
app dev but the intent here is to as

267
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,740
opposed to this standard compliance

268
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,860
question are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> performing</font>

269
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,160
vulnerability scans by going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

270
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,500
this type of maturity exercise the

271
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,020
question then is and you will be able to

272
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer it how mature is your</font>

273
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,640
vulnerability management process how

274
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,580
mature is your threat management process

275
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,430
in this case how mature is your software

276
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,400
development lifecycle so what I'm what

277
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,469
I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the past again couple</font>

278
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">years last year I did vulnerability</font>

279
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,850
management this year threat management

280
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:40,610
is from an improvement perspect

281
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,940
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken this framework this level</font>

282
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:49,300
1 level 2 level 3 framework for the ASV

283
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:52,220
s and applied it to threat management so

284
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,508
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through some of the</font>

285
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:59,509
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel it makes sense to to</font>

286
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:04,399
exist in each of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> three levels for</font>

287
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:06,470
threat management and then and then I

288
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,769
actually put some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff out on github</font>

289
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:13,040
that I would love everybody to then take

290
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:16,819
a look at and contribute merge back into

291
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,980
the actual you know the repo but it's it

292
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:20,180
is essentially a threat management and a

293
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,050
vulnerability management but I'm not

294
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to cover that one here but they</font>

295
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">both live in the same repo a threat</font>

296
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:31,819
management maturity framework so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

298
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:37,579
to the ASB s framework opportunistic

299
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this indicates that the</font>

300
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:42,469
organization can adequately defend

301
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:45,110
itself against non-targeted threats that

302
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,550
are easy to discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay typically</font>

303
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,509
discovered with minimal to low effort

304
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:53,000
and so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

305
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:55,220
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a requirement for at least</font>

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,189
achieving level 1 i've come up with this

307
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,899
right there's no dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec or</font>

308
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,089
risk group there's a reliance on

309
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:06,019
rudimentary alerts firewalls network

310
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,880
network IPS antivirus etc there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

311
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,620
process in place for handling malware

312
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,889
infected systems right and that's

313
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,779
typically some type of refresh refresh

314
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,259
the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be effect infected</font>

315
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:21,470
etc there is centralized logging but no

316
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:24,050
correlation the sporadic quote threat

317
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:27,319
intelligence is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from very basic</font>

318
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:31,339
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like network world or maybe even</font>

319
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:33,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sans email subscription there might be</font>

320
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:36,560
some open source vulnerability scanning

321
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:39,529
tool that is assisting in and and and

322
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,290
you know assisting providing data into

323
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:44,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat management process itself and</font>

324
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,959
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization then is comfortable</font>

325
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,540
with essentially regulatory compliance

326
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,400
in other words the the idea that

327
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,130
being compliant to whatever framework

328
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:59,420
that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure our</font>

329
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:03,170
business critical data so level<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

330
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,870
right level two this is the standard

331
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">again that most organizations are proud</font>

332
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,070
be looking at which indicates that the

333
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,689
organization can adequately defend

334
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,360
itself against prevalent threats of

335
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,180
moderate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious capability which</font>

336
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,010
could include hacktivism and

337
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,810
non-targeted organized crime actors the

338
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:24,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of business organizations again</font>

339
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,510
should work towards this level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

340
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what I think that looks like and</font>

341
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,450
again this is why I you know have put

342
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,750
this up on github because i want a

343
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,490
community you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially i'm our</font>

344
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,880
community input from this this is what I

345
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:43,580
think for level<font color="#CCCCCC"> two threat management</font>

346
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:46,480
applied to the asp s framework there is

347
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,040
now a dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec / risk group</font>

348
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,610
including a dedicated monitoring

349
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,069
resource integration with existing level

350
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 vulnerability management right so</font>

351
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,530
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm applying the ASV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s2</font>

352
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,390
vulnerability management a similar level

353
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:06,230
vulnerability management process should

354
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:08,990

penetration / purple team testing

358
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,140
everybody understand the concept of

359
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,420
purple team testing a couple people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,470
side by side with the defenders and

365
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,060
stepping through kill James basically

366
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,530
stepping through attacked chains right

367
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,240
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this then we're going</font>

368
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,010

detect this did you like that did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

370
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,170
detect this right and so collectively

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,379
the collaborative nature of that purple

provided organizations a lot more value

374
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,070
than just saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay go attack break in</font>

375
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,850
and see what those guys are doing see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

376
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,850
they've detected anything

447
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,630
and therefore bypassing all antivirus

448
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,490
bypassing all what application

449
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:22,179
whitelisting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the the trending of</font>

450
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:25,270
how advanced actors are actually getting

451
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:27,340
into systems needs to be part of your

452
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligence and if the intelligence</font>

453
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:33,370
says that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even touching disk</font>

454
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,590
and bypassing all you there's a need now

455
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,870
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an advanced level of endpoint</font>

456
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,459
control that whatever that might be but

457
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,280
is looking at different things right

458
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,419
microsoft has Emmett which is free the

459
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,918
enhanced mitigation experience toolkit

460
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:50,620
be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it it's still a little</font>

461
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,429
interesting in in an Active Directory

462
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,750
enterprise but hey you know something

463
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,540
that's free and it's looking at things

464
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,980
like behavioral anomalies what is a what

465
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,700
does a buffer overflow actually look

466
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,309
like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not looking at did this you</font>

467
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,440
know did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code that just executed on</font>

468
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:12,940
you know my machine match a signature

469
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,580
it's looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at more things there's a</font>

470
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,830
couple examples here right enter product

471
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,199
and corporate cloud adoption standards

472
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,668
we have to you know obviously we have to

473
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into consideration everything that</font>

474
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:25,480
is happening in the cloud at this point

475
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:28,629
but we need these<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of standards to</font>

476
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,750
meet this level two criteria<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

477
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:36,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk assessments right are your third</font>

478
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,919
parties basically complying with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

479
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:42,370
standards or what you feel your business

480
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,200
should be requiring from you know in

481
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,389
terms of two factor authentication in

482
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,030
terms of password you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> management</font>

483
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:53,100
etc so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

484
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk assessment is necessary as well</font>

485
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:00,850
encryption is pretty important as well

486
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:05,110
and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we when we take a look at</font>

487
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:07,299
now this level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 model of maturity in</font>

488
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,010
turn in relation to threat management I

489
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,000
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's fairly reasonable I</font>

490
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,580
think that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things are fairly</font>

491
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,640
reasonable for most organizations to

492
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,730
begin working towards right and again

493
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody has unlimited budget this is one</font>

494
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:25,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">to three-year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know type planning</font>

495
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,059
strategically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to begin moving towards a</font>

496
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:31,809
mature level<font color="#E5E5E5"> to threat management</font>

497
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:34,178
process so now what is level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

498
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:37,059
like now level 3 obviously is going to

499
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:41,980
require quite a bit more time energy

500
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:43,870
motivation etc but from a high level

501
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,419
perspective this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it looks like</font>

502
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,580
an organization can adequately defend

503
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:50,980
itself against all advanced all in

504
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,750
quotation marks sorry all advanced

505
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,480
threats and shows principles of good

506
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,760
security design requires a mature

507
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,770
enterprise security architecture we go

508
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,390
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that you know the enterprise</font>

509
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:05,679
security architecture model that I laid

510
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:07,929
out this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate for</font>

511
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,000
critical applications that protect life

512
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:13,330
critical infrastructure and or defense

513
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so when we take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

514
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,000
these requirements we've kind of we've

515
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:22,629
already stepped through level two so

516
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,950
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> two exists now threat</font>

517
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:29,169
prioritization standards right so there

518
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,080
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some type of threat</font>

519
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:34,620
prioritization standard that takes into

520
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,168
consideration you know from event to

521
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,040
incident who needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerted who</font>

522
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,040
needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be involved</font>

523
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:47,290
who's accountable<font color="#CCCCCC"> ray see right there so</font>

524
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:48,730
the racy charts should be should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font>

525
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:53,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">loaded right there right so mature I our</font>

526
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:55,570
framework includes buying etc but

527
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,960
understanding ok now what level of

528
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,240
incident from a prior perspective can to

529
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,190
help desk deal with and what level of

530
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,920
incident from a priority perspective

531
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,870
needs to be escalated to the sock right

532
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,890
because at this point we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

533
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:14,020
dedicated sock based on level<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and</font>

534
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,930
now what are those responsibilities look

535
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,240
like I our tabletop exercises and these

536
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:23,500
can include<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like domain breach</font>

537
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:27,670
that then as part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual incident</font>

538
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,620
response process forces the responding

539
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,130
teams to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to outer band communications</font>

540
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:35,290
right these types of exercises fishing

541
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,150
the high-value target and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

542
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,639
the CEO whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the executive</font>

543
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,860
assistant who is actually typically much

544
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,670
more fun and interesting to go after

545
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,320
because of her access or their access

546
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:50,160
ransomware simulating actual ransomware

547
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,080
simulating<font color="#CCCCCC"> the malicious insiders</font>

550
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,320
threat investigative activity is

551
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,910
documented right we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

552
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">are honey pots does anybody know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

553
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:08,380
cept is deceptive very interesting tool

554
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,250
that Dell SecureWorks just released a

555
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:15,070
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> months ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of the</font>

556
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:19,210
ways that the malicious actor and teams

557
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,889
like ours get into and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are</font>

558
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,780
able to move laterally<font color="#CCCCCC"> through an</font>

559
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,430
organization once we let's say fish a

560
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:29,110
target is through a process called

561
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:31,060
basically we're scraping memory

562
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,810
credentials we're scraping login

563
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,850
credentials either in clear text or the

564
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:40,270
actual hashes the password hashes from

565
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:43,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LSS memory process there's a program</font>

566
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:47,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">called mini cats that does this and it</font>

567
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:51,280
does it very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so d cept right there</font>

568
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,840
is really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting it's</font>

569
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,760
basically honey hashes

570
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,279
so if you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> conceptually what a</font>

571
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,580
honeypot<font color="#CCCCCC"> is right we have a system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

572
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,620
is on purpose has vulnerabilities and

573
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,399
we're monitoring for all of those types

574
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:09,219
of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exploit those vulnerabilities</font>

575
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,909
d cept is honey hashing so basically

576
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's throwing up into the LSS process</font>

577
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:19,809
fake hashes fake password hashes so now

578
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,700
your sock team that's monitoring for you

579
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:26,379
know all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things can be</font>

580
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:29,590
monitoring for the the usage of fake

581
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:33,100
password hashes if that shows up boom

582
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:36,129
that you know we know exactly a ground

583
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,719

moving laterally through your you know

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,020
pull artifacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so what's running</font>

596
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,000
in memory right what are the processes

<font color="#E5E5E5">that are running on these systems that</font>

598
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,090
we you know we have reports that

599
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,309
somebody clicked on something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

600
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,649
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have right so by</font>

601
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:26,230
getting all of this type of data into

602
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:29,620
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir the sock and then the ir</font>

603
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,960
teams now we again are building towards

604
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,029
threat prioritization right we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

605
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,880
more data that we can that we can look

606
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:38,169
at and make these important decisions

607
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,809
process creation auditing is also very

608
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:44,950
important enforceable identity access

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,530
then being able to prevent them from

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,280
from actually getting on getting an IP

617
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:12,760

618
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,950
organization who had a big four

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:23,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">defensive blue side we were looking for</font>

for those of you who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

624
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:31,900
microsoft created the greatest hacking

625
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:33,639
tool ever in powershell so we were

628
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,320
made aware that the red team was

629
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:43,840
actually starting that the the the

631
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,659
with in under an hour we were able to

632
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,230
utilize the you know the network

633
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,970
identity access control systems to

634
00:29:52,230 --> 00:30:00,400
isolate that system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just knock them</font>

635
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:04,420
off the network in under an hour so they

636
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,340
didn't like that and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had</font>

637
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,650
to let<font color="#CCCCCC"> them back onto the network to</font>

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,090
finish their you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish all these</font>

639
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,900
tests because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very expensive</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and the clients that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

641
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,650
didn't necessarily think that all that

money should be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an hour so</font>

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,510
show you an example of threat

multipliers in a second adversary

646
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:33,010
capabilities assessment right return on

00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:34,810
investment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the last time I was</font>

648
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,580
here at our VA suck a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago I</font>

649
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,700
mentioned Josh Gorman I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:43,240
mention them again free plug perform

651
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">corpsman is he's talked about on many</font>

652
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,180
occasions the concept of adversary

653
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:51,160
return on investment but the gist is

654
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:55,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">data theft is a giant business every</font>

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">business has a budget so by</font>

656
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,710
understanding who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

657
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:02,080
incentivized to steal your data and what

658
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:05,170
their capabilities are we can begin

659
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,240
developing a model around calculating

660
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:10,120
some level of return on investment for

661
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the adversary right it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

662
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">them they have a budget to steal your</font>

663
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,649
data so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take them time</font>

664
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,930
money energy

665
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:21,450
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break into your systems</font>

666
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:23,040
escalate move laterally find what they

667
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:28,200
want that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> valuable to them and</font>

668
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:30,930
exfiltrate it out so understanding the

669
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,310
actual threat adversary return on

670
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,460
investment their capabilities is a

671
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:39,690
critical part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of threat management</font>

672
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:44,990
itself periodic threat matrix exercises

673
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:47,100
and you know your reports as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but</font>

674
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,260
metrics so let's talk about metrics

675
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,719
metrics from a threat management

676
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,330
perspective we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

677
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,480
incident metrics right so incident

678
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,220
character the characteristics target

679
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,650
system characteristics the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timelines</font>

680
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,360
from an attack metrics perspective the

681
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:06,110
vectors the attacks sophistication

682
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,929
attack profile characteristics

683
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,790
obfuscation<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques data metrics</font>

684
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,680
right so what data has been targeted

685
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,050
what you know what data has been

686
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,320
compromised itself what data has

687
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:21,149
actually been exfiltrated incidents by

688
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,560
status then here's now where we're

689
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,200
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into enterprise ticketing</font>

690
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,679
systems right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so the maturity level</font>

691
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,870
at level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three should have your IR teams</font>

692
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,960
working you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know within the confines of</font>

693
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,989
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise ticketing system</font>

694
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,750
right so now by looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the status of</font>

695
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:42,780
tickets we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> begin to track and</font>

696
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,440
generate future metrics for the business

697
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:49,320
and then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my favorites here</font>

698
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,800
meantime to compromise what's the cost

699
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,899
to disrupt right an attack what is the

700
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,210
adversary means or capabilities like I

701
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:01,320
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again adversary return</font>

702
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:03,300
on investment so that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in a</font>

703
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,080
nutshell at a high level is is what I

704
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:09,419
think level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three threat management</font>

705
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,389
applied to the ASV s framework should

706
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:15,570
look like I want to talk a little bit

707
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:18,090
about threat modeling I'm I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

708
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,669
to say I'm you know I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

709
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,860
stand<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> preach one versus another</font>

710
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,870
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just make sure that I'm</font>

711
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,149
communicating that there are a number of

712
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,800
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat model threat modeling</font>

713
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,549
frameworks out there this is the three

714
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,269
tenants

715
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:36,090
model there is also the diamond model of

716
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:40,110
intrusion analysis which is an excellent

717
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:43,049
excellent paper if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are you know</font>

718
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,600
within your organization you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know on the</font>

719
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:49,369
threat management side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the house one</font>

720
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,860
of my favorites is Bruce Potter did a

721
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:54,529
talk at<font color="#E5E5E5"> der beek on a couple years ago</font>

722
00:33:51,860 --> 00:34:00,719
called threat modeling for reals and

723
00:33:54,529 --> 00:34:03,269
within that this is so simple I love it

724
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,149
right so here's a threat model actor

725
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:08,089
does action to asset resulting in

726
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:11,759
outcome because of motivation a

727
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:15,049
beautiful that's a beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> Simplot you</font>

728
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,990
know simplified version of threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

729
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:21,770
some additional important things

730
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:24,089
documentation this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lenny Seltzer's</font>

731
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:27,179
cyber threat intelligence Incident

732
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:29,449
Response report it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually about 12</font>

733
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,069
pages long but it breaks everything down

734
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:35,489
beautifully from a documentation

735
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:38,308
perspective you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

736
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,500
again all these metrics that I've been

737
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:42,799
talking about right so the capabilities

738
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:47,549
of the actor what are they targeting etc

739
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:50,190
but it's just a fantastic template for

740
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:53,969
documenting your incident response your

741
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:56,879
incidents lexicon is also very important

742
00:34:53,969 --> 00:35:00,209
Varys is an open source project that is

743
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:04,618
really intended to create a common

744
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:07,890
lexicon about incident data right so

745
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:10,140
event recording<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus the vocabulary</font>

746
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,879
for event recording an incident sharing

747
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,900
is a set of metrics designed to provide

748
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,510
a common language for describing

749
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,420
security incidents in a structured and

750
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:21,809
repeatable manner again that's github

751
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:25,700
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is great you know all</font>

752
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:30,089
this is free the last couple things here

753
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:36,720
let's let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

754
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">this I have demo in in quotes here</font>

755
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,000
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a demo it's an</font>

756
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,379
Excel spreadsheet but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

757
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to do this anyway</font>

758
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:58,230
so bear with me if this doesn't work

759
00:35:46,069 --> 00:36:01,470
wait for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey at least I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get an</font>

760
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:04,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Excel spreadsheet to work for it 10 okay</font>

761
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,629
so this is very very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh let me</font>

762
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:11,220
start with this right over here on this

763
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:16,259
other tab is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first tab this is the</font>

764
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual official a SBS spreadsheet right</font>

765
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:22,710
so it's broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> down into different</font>

766
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:25,109
subsections so you know section 2 and

767
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:29,309
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all these types of things</font>

768
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:31,859
that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what level depending</font>

769
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:33,960
on the result of your organization right

770
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:37,019
you will then fall into these levels

771
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,140
right obviously level 3 has every one of

772
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:43,680
these as part of it right so that's the

773
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,470
ASV s here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my version for threat</font>

774
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,118
management right so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

775
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">the organization I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to go</font>

776
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,740
through all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these right but but again I</font>

777
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my github site</font>

778
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,258
so you can go check it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and hopefully</font>

779
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:59,880
contribute that'd be great but taking a

780
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:02,339
look at things from an organizational

781
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,470
perspective verifying data

782
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:07,859
classification standards exist right

783
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,689
verifying user / group to critical

784
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:12,769
services standard exists that's

785
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">important because threat priority right</font>

786
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:18,660
ensuring that we have an understanding

787
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:21,900
of if a user is being targeted what

788
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,180
their role and therefore criticality to

789
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,579
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is that's going to</font>

790
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,578
affect our threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritization right</font>

791
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:35,160
so again I broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down into</font>

792
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:37,289
organization controls monitoring actual

793
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,899
incident response and then documentation

794
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:42,869
and metrics the other thing that i will

795
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,769
show you here is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a sample</font>

796
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:48,089
of one of our prioritization

797
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:50,490
spreadsheets right so we're starting

798
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:53,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">with okay we've got this type of input</font>

799
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:56,609
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> these types of systems as well as</font>

800
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:57,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">user reports you know in this case the</font>

801
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,819
this

802
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,410
same as q radar so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can start</font>

803
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:04,529
playing around with things like okay

804
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:08,249
well we we've just discovered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

805
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:12,150
have a remote access<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool in in the</font>

806
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:14,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment and actually we have 20 to</font>

807
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:17,069
50 of them you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

808
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:20,369
we're based on the criteria that we had

809
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:23,420
for this particular example for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

810
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:26,249
particular business we now know that

811
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:30,240
based on that we you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

812
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:32,459
escalate the corp ID portion of this

813
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,200
though is is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I was just</font>

814
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know we</font>

815
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,598
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell to get the ad principal</font>

816
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:41,309
group membership and and figure out what

817
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,099
groups that that person is a member of

818
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:45,839
and based on that data now we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin</font>

819
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,819
mapping those groups to the critical

820
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,819
services within the business itself and

821
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:54,749
now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prioritization from a user</font>

822
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:58,279
perspective right so now if let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

823
00:38:54,749 --> 00:39:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not a remote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tool</font>

824
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:03,739
but it's something maybe like just a

825
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:07,049
standard virus and it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> affecting</font>

826
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:09,829
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of people but one of</font>

827
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:12,839
those people happens to be in a group

828
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:14,670
that is a critical role to one of the

829
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual organization's business critical</font>

830
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,019
business units that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to you know</font>

831
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,420
the calculation is going to escalate

832
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:26,038
that up to now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

833
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know pump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that up into the sock when</font>

834
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,799
we bump it up into the sock now we can

835
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:36,509
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have some threat multipliers</font>

836
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:38,519
right and in this case in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we</font>

837
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">used we also use a tool called threat</font>

838
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:46,558
grid which you can take a sample of

839
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:48,359
malware either an actual link or or an

840
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,029
actual either word document or

841
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:53,880
executable and submit it into this cloud

842
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:57,779
service they blow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up they figure out</font>

843
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the network that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they explode all</font>

844
00:39:57,779 --> 00:40:02,599
the processes figure out the networks

845
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,799
that it's communicating back to

846
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,049
basically everything from a profile

847
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:08,609
perspective you would want from from you

848
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:09,980
know dissecting a piece of malware but

849
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:12,380
they do it in the sandbox and

850
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,940
cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the support now</font>

851
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,680
you have everything you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to begin</font>

852
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,420
searching for that within the

853
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,129
organization here are the registry

854
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,580
entries that that particular malware

855
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,340
edited or added or deleted now let's go

856
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,390
search for throughout the organization

857
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:30,080
threat multipliers though are things

858
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:33,500
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times we may not know from</font>

859
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,259
a response perspective right so origin

860
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,119
well we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not know that at first but</font>

861
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,390
if there comes a point where we do begin

862
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:44,390
now you know to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that understanding</font>

863
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:46,910
threat multiplier right what is the

864
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,970
intent right steal money destroy assets

865
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:52,310
hurt reputation but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

866
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:54,290
day here's you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of look</font>

867
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,420
down in here at rating description

868
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:59,529
response and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot if we give this a</font>

869
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,760
different you know rating from an actual

870
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,369
scoring perspective a prioritization

871
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,109
perspective we these things who do we

872
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:08,540
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notify the seaso etc depending</font>

873
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:13,359
on the priority of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> event</font>

874
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,359
itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay get back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

875
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,270
come on

876
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,299
there we go so continue laughing because

877
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:38,650
that's awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the last</font>

878
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:42,870
couple things here this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

879
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:47,500
very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> little repo alright so those</font>

880
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:49,779
the threat management Excel spreadsheet

881
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,690
that I just gave you I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed you</font>

882
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,030
that's here as well as from last year

883
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:59,860
the vulnerability management framework

884
00:41:55,030 --> 00:42:02,800
as well so I would love it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people you</font>

885
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:05,140
know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested feel free to</font>

886
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,400
