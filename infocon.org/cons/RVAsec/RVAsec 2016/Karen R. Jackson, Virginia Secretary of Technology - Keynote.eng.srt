31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,689
minutes together so I don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font>

myself talk for 50 minutes so if you

have questions as we go along please let

34
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,609
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just throw a hand up and we'll</font>

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,740
take it I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be here I was here</font>

36
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">last year as he mentioned when the great</font>

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,939
introduction of the governor happened

38
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,439
and I think the most poignant moment for

39
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,788
me was he was reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> through his notes</font>

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,408
when you were doing the introduction so

41
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:57,689
we didn't hear it on the first pass and

42
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,069
so he turns to me and says what did he

43
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,508
say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let him tell you why</font>

44
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,469
that's pertinent if you weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

45
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,119
last year and so I had had one of my

46
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:10,410
moments in my career of wow I didn't

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,220
think I'd ever be saying this to a

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,660
governor but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,239
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here today I'm sorry I'm al tad</font>

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,640
bit late I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan that so my office</font>

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,739
is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight down broad street and</font>

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,738
like cyber security you know it's always

53
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,170
the unexpected that gets you when you

54
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,299
least expect it so I go to get in my car

55
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,250
I literally have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-minute shot down</font>

56
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,230
broad street and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn out of the</font>

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,930
parking<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot and there's a megabus that's</font>

58
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:43,560
broken down across the end of the

59
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:45,000
parking lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok it's a one-way street so</font>

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,769
Capitol Police was out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,269
said well we might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> squeeze</font>

62
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:52,980
you through or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just go the wrong</font>

63
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:54,599
way I think I'll go the wrong way and

64
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,819
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> my chances that was probably the</font>

65
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,230
wrong answer based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my experience so I</font>

66
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,700
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> for being a little bit late</font>

67
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,638
what I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to you about</font>

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,970
today's in a cybersecurity Commonwealth

69
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,040
style<font color="#E5E5E5"> really as a state government we</font>

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pretty interesting situations</font>

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,880
that we have to deal with we have a lot

72
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,730
of constituencies that we have to try to

73
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,650
keep happy and we really do you know at

74
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,540
the end of the day the citizens all of

75
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,239
you that are Virginia<font color="#E5E5E5"> residents are our</font>

76
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,060
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we have a lot of work</font>

77
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,829
to do to stay ahead of the mobile apps

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,599
that you want to have I know you know

79
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,669
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't ever move as fast as</font>

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,738
private business but we try to stay up

81
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">on current trends and try to keep moving</font>

82
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,489
into into mobile environments and other

83
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,020
online ways for you to communicate with

84
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we hear a lot that you want</font>

85
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,500
and so with that let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a</font>

86
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,570
little bit of perspective I have a

87
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred thousand state employees that</font>

88
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,920
ride my network every day we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,880
unified contract with northrop grumman

90
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,070
and it's been in place since 2006 so a

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,329
unified you know we took all of our

92
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,260
architecture everything from phones

93
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,710
peripherals<font color="#E5E5E5"> BlackBerry's printers</font>

94
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,890
network laptops everything and put it on

95
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:11,240
a unified enterprise network back in

96
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:13,519
2006 2007 it was a great move in 2006 or

97
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,620
2007 but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about and</font>

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:21,290
now 13 year old IT contract it's a

99
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time it's it's a</font>

100
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,270
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all the things that have</font>

101
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,770
come into being since 2006 and you think

102
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a contract where you're trying to</font>

103
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,130
keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and it's been daunting</font>

104
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,540
it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for us because we could</font>

105
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,170
never have afforded to upgrade the

106
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,450
infrastructure but at the same time

107
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,610
light has moved on and so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

108
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,140
struggled with<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a lot with BYOD we</font>

109
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,240
do a lot of other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to make</font>

110
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,580
up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we are in this</font>

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,860
contract for a few more years so that's

112
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">one hundred thousand eighty nine state</font>

113
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,380
agencies that are on the network you

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,740
know an enterprise contract I don't

115
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,140
control apps I only control the the

116
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,260
enterprise piece of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network's we do</font>

117
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,520
provide security standards and security

118
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,960
actually a shared services center now

119
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,349
thanks to the governor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the General</font>

120
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,530
Assembly but there's a lot of holes out

121
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:16,610
there that I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> control and so my day</font>

122
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:19,130
to day sleep is pretty limited we had an

123
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,240
outage about a week ago at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dmv's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

124
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,919
sure some of you may have been at the

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,530
DMV and try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your license renewed</font>

126
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,140
or conduct a transaction unfortunately

127
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not a cyber attack that was a</font>

128
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,890
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hardware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failed but every</font>

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,800
time something like that happens the

130
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,560
first question we ask ourselves is not

131
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,100
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> why but was it something malicious</font>

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,450
and was it something related to cyber

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,250
instead of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> used that used to be the</font>

134
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">last question you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of</font>

135
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,270
the last thing you started now it's all

136
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,909
flipped around and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

137
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,870
first question we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask ourselves</font>

138
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,830
fortunately it wasn't he's a hardware

139
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,280
failed

140
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,289
as it will but when you consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the vectors that we have we intersect</font>

142
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,030
with localities we intersect with our

citizens we intersect with our agencies

we intersect with municipalities in a

regular way through social services

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,229
departments of health we have a lot of

147
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,860
points of entry for bad actors and it's

148
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:18,920
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to secure all</font>

149
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,870
of those things because we don't control

150
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,750
all of those things just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't my biggest fear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that I have</font>

152
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,670
one employee who clicks on a phishing

161
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:52,910
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pressure because when we go</font>

162
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,640
down your services go down when your

163
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,890
services go down you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy we've</font>

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,190
state and so we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just uber</font>

171
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,560
diligent about the way that we protect

173
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,570
astounding for me when we came into

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,820
office we're now about 19 months away

175
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,070
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of our term so Virginia</font>

stole one governorship we get 14 year

178
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,580
part of this the thing that astounded me

179
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,030
most when I took over even haven't been

180
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,800
a deputy was that we only had about

181
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,979
thirty three percent of our agencies

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that had completed a security audit that</font>

183
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:47,630
was a mandatory security audit really

184
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,849
mandatory that left<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a little bit</font>

185
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,030
confused and it left me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

186
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,710
left me a lot concerned the good news<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

187
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,349
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the agencies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hadn't</font>

189
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,360
a position of not having a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of PII</font>

190
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:05,590
not having a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of customer facing apps</font>

191
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,020
and just frankly being very very

192
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,549
are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small and so they gave me a</font>

193
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,159
little bit of comfort until we could

194
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,600
find ways to get through that process so

195
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the political process is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really criticized of not taking a linear</font>

or its accused of being and I just so

everybody knows it's an issue there's

not anybody around that hasn't heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

the OPM hack they haven't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected</font>

now get to monitor your credit for a

year I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to me but yet now</font>

215
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,860
it's my responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep me safe</font>

216
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,240
because you got breached I don't ever

<font color="#E5E5E5">Commonwealth in the face and hand them</font>

220
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,400
how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the beginning of</font>

221
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,890
the term the governor stood up the

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commission and stood up a cyber</font>

223
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">commission we had it for about two years</font>

224
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,459
and so we've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a sunset on that</font>

225
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,740
group we feel like we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

226
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,720
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> spadework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had five different</font>

227
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">workgroups and i'll come back to hit</font>

228
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,750
this linear solution in just a second

229
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,230
but we had five<font color="#E5E5E5"> different working groups</font>

230
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,620
one was infrastructure one was crime

231
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,450
basically cybercrime one was education

232
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,010
and workforce one was economic

233
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,930
development and one was public awareness

234
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,970
so those were the five vectors that we

235
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,689
asked our commission members to work

236
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,740
across so this security<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit piece that</font>

237
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute ago</font>

238
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,780
actually fell under the infrastructure

239
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,950
piece so the infrastructure piece

240
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,530
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> workgroup scuze me said</font>

241
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">you really need to get your eyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

242
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,540
your your heads around exactly how much

243
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,820
PII the Commonwealth has who owns it

244
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,339
how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it secured how's it encrypted and</font>

245
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,230
really try to get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands on that so</font>

246
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,150
the governor rather than waiting until

247
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years completed we have this big</font>

248
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,230
report we've been working on

249
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,790
recommendations that we needed to peel

250
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">off and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do immediately and we've done</font>

251
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,410
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of the first</font>

252
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,879
recommendations would you really need

253
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,410
get your head around how much PII you

254
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,509
have where it is and how well it's

255
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,430
secured so we issued thanks to the

256
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:28,740
governor's leadership an executive order

257
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,810
that made our agencies work with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

258
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,879
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us where that information is how</font>

259
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">its secured who has access to it those</font>

260
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,089
sorts of things we also went back

261
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,399
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the security audits and</font>

262
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,889
we said who's done them who hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

263
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,230
them who's done them well how<font color="#CCCCCC"> often have</font>

264
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,050
they been refreshed and we came to the

265
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,500
conclusion that really we had a whole

266
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,329
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of agencies that were really big</font>

267
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,610
that needed a<font color="#CCCCCC"> full-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

268
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:57,989
security officer Department of Health

269
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,519
DMV<font color="#CCCCCC"> vdot the ones that had the most tax</font>

270
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,519
the ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the most critical</font>

271
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">information they need a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full time sigh</font>

272
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,300
so without without a doubt we got to

273
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,459
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're taking care hemen</font>

274
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,680
resource management was another one so

275
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,300
we made movements to get them all

276
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,849
full-time chief information security

277
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:18,329
officers for everybody else they kind of

278
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,389
spanned a pretty wide spectrum some had

279
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,489
some PII some had none some had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

280
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,959
bit and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all over the place</font>

281
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,839
so what we decided there was to actually

282
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,279
form a shared services model that we

283
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,199
were able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say okay we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

284
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,139
form this core group of information

285
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,290
security professionals within my my

286
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:39,300
agencies and then be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to parse them</font>

287
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,730
out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other agencies on a regular</font>

288
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,258
basis to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is secure</font>

289
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,529
as they can be but we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hire</font>

290
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,720
an individual site so for each agency

291
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,290
some of which might really need them a

292
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,230
part of a week maybe a few hours every

293
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,000
week but they didn't need them 24 by 7

294
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,410
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we've really gone from a</font>

295
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,930
commission recommendation to

296
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,490
implementing something that really will

297
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,138
change the way our agencies will do

298
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,870
business they change the way we secure

299
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,000
or data and ultimately will you know

300
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,050
have an impact on how secure citizens

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,579
can feel when they're actually

302
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,290
transacting business with the

303
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:15,029
Commonwealth so that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

304
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,949
arenas we've worked on I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

305
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:20,069
the most interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five work</font>

306
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:21,240
groups for me has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybercrime you</font>

307
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,639
know a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these actors are</font>

308
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,019
international we know that but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

309
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,420
the laws on the books in the

310
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,240
Commonwealth for things like human

311
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:33,479
trafficking child pornography

312
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,260
those types of cyber crimes haven't been

313
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,380
updated in probably a hundred years so

314
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,990
how do you take a law that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

315
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in 1900 may be updated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

317
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:52,800
the virtual criminal it's tough it's

318
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:54,600
very very difficult to get legislators

319
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,089
who don't work in this every day there's

320
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,520
not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> techie legislators around</font>

321
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:02,640
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the 140 that we have but how do</font>

322
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them to understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need</font>

323
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,620
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of leeway and the time</font>

324
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,480
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you notify a cybercriminal that</font>

325
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,709
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at them because if you</font>

tell them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking at them</font>

327
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,430
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go away I'm just going</font>

surveil them they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just disappeared they</font>

331
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,709
destroy their hard drive they throw in

332
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,870
the water they you know big heavy magnet

333
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,939
it's all gone and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pop up</font>

334
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,100
somewhere later on so we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

335
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,430
on things like being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually if</font>

336
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,860
you if we expected criminal element and

337
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,209
we want to be able to look at them

338
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,130
instead of notifying them through their

339
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,989
isp<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day we start looking we have a</font>

340
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,820
30 day window indefinitely in very

341
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,550
specific cases that deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with victims</font>

342
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,130
that are under 17 years old but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we knew</font>

343
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,620
that we couldn't we couldn't tip our

344
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,970
hand day one so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

345
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,550
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to work on another thing</font>

346
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,770
is law enforcement and aligning

347
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,020
magistrates and warrants so a lot of our

348
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,660
forensics works is actually done in labs

349
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,790
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> State Police or a local gets the</font>

350
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,110
computer in they know that there's

351
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,670
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it they need they have a</font>

352
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,890
warrant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer and the data</font>

353
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's on it but the labs five counties</font>

354
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:15,449
away we had magistrates that we're

355
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:17,520
requiring multiple warrants in order to

356
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,440
actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that computer once it</font>

357
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,800
got to the lab because across

358
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,930
jurisdictions that's nuts I mean that's

359
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,640
absolutely crazy if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

360
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,770
jurisdiction where you know that there's

361
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,750
an issue and all you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is just</font>

362
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,660
transporting it to the forensic expert

363
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do the work we needed</font>

364
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,380
to straighten that out so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed that</font>

365
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,540
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that I think was the</font>

366
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,880
least popular was I went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

367
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,199
whole idea we don't secure apps and a

368
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,390
lot of our data is city

369
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,670
and these agencies and security audits

370
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,640
and those sorts of things we added to

371
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,650
the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> description for our agency heads</font>

372
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,560
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually responsible for</font>

373
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,510
the data that was in their purview you'd

374
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,819
be surprised how many agency heads went

375
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:04,319
what you secure that no no no no no no

376
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,420
no that's that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you're</font>

377
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,850
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're</font>

378
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,290
responsible for your services<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

379
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,540
you're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everything else</font>

380
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:16,439
you're now you are responsible for your

381
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,380
data that was a real surreal

382
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,880
enlightening moment for a lot of folks I

383
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,390
wish I could say it man you mentally

384
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,670
changed behaviour it didn't we still had

385
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,199
security audit some when I'm done but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

386
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,459
there was at least one moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

387
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,170
reckoning when they said okay if

388
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">something really bad goes wrong with his</font>

389
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,329
data I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on the line for it</font>

390
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,579
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty interesting pretty</font>

391
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,990
interesting move to have to make but it

392
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,210
was something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we felt was important</font>

393
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,550
given the world that we live in so we

394
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,850
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked economic development</font>

395
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,099
the governor is a master marketer we've

396
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,810
been to RSA the<font color="#E5E5E5"> national cyber</font>

397
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,730
conference out in San Francisco I've

398
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:57,660
been the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last two years he went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

399
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:01,770
there last year this year and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

400
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:05,400
only governor to show up what governor

401
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:07,350
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world wouldn't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the</font>

402
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">largest cyber conference where all these</font>

403
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,700
cyber businesses are and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to convince</font>

404
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">them that their state was the best place</font>

405
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:18,330
to come kind of seems like easy picking

406
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just makes a lot of sense to me but</font>

407
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,630
he was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only governor to show up so</font>

408
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,400
we met with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Virginia companies</font>

409
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,930
we also met with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies that</font>

410
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,630
were out of state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

411
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,420
putting satellite offices here or moving

412
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:33,140
here a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

413
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,339
proximity to the federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> government but</font>

414
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">we went out there and spent two days</font>

415
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,950
going just as hard as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could possibly</font>

416
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,900
go had a great great interaction with

417
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,240
our companies but also that with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

418
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israeli companies for those of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

419
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,920
who haven't studied a lot on Israel they

420
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,010
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best cyber ecosystems in</font>

421
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,500
the world Israel is really coming on as

422
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,290
one of the cyberpower houses for a lot

423
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different reasons</font>

424
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,490
and so we met with them at length that

425
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,959
actually just had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> roundtable a couple</font>

of days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it they're ahead of</font>

that's doing cyber company acceleration

432
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,309
up in the Northern Virginia area and so

433
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,290
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there's there's a lot of</font>

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:41,679
about 17,000 cyber jobs in Virginia at a

have different flavors of the kind of

worked on initiatives to kind of retool

455
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,390
what high school looks like we've pushed

456
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:15,400
computer science down we didn't add any

that kids start getting exposed to

programming and coding and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

461
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,620
as early as possible through some of the

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,020
programs that already exist we're

looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our veteran population we</font>

have Virginia's got the highest

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,559
when they separate whether they retire

471
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,740
or whether they just separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

their tour of duty are looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> jobs</font>

473
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,970
we want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay here because we</font>

474
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,570
need their talents and we need their

475
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,950
help to fill these 17,000 jobs the cyber

476
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,950
companies aren't going to go where there

477
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,049
aren't people to fill the jobs we have

478
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,299
regular conversations with Palo Alto and

479
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:07,120
fire I and Cisco and Microsoft and

480
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:09,549
Amazon Web Services and they are all

481
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,469
putting a heavy emphasis on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

482
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,090
recruitment of veterans so there's any

483
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,970
veterans in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room first thank you for</font>

484
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,939
your service but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are looking for</font>

485
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,830
credentials I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> HIGHLY encourage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

486
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,110
to look into the programs that those

487
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,369
folks offer some of them offer the

488
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,689
opportunity to get their certificate

489
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:31,629
programs with very little cash outlay if

490
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,460
any they offer scholarships so if you

491
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,830
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in that in that niche I</font>

492
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,679
would suggest you you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunting there</font>

493
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,859
was actually I think Michelle Obama and

494
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,509
Joe Biden and this is not a political

495
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:45,879
commentary at the beginning of may

496
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,379
actually had a big event and announced a

497
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:49,299
lot of these scholarship programs so if

498
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,820
you noodle around a little bit you might

499
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,019
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to get some</font>

500
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">certifications with very little capital</font>

501
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:59,830
investment on your part so we on the

502
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:02,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">education front as well we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

503
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:05,259
Commission have really worked to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

504
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:08,519
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what works in the education</font>

505
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:12,489
space you know if you talk to industry

506
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:15,309
we try to grab the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of input that</font>

507
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:17,169
they want and a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee but then we</font>

508
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,668
have traditional education systems that

509
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:21,249
have been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hundreds of years</font>

510
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:22,690
that we then have to try to mold to fit

511
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:24,340
what they need and of course we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

512
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,309
this not only in cyber but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

513
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,499
it in bio we're doing it and you know

514
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer science general IT we're doing</font>

515
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:33,970
it in aviation we've mentioned the

516
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,980
unmanned systems on the in systems is

517
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,210
another big area of opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

518
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,220
Commonwealth so we're asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

519
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,190
colleges in our community colleges to do

520
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,320
a lot of new things all at once and so

521
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,230
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sensitive to pick the best</font>

522
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,249
ones so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just throwing</font>

523
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,799
activities at them and hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

524
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:53,019
can implement them so we've worked on a

525
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,859
couple of initiatives first is we're

526
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:59,049
building a cyber range for Virginia one

527
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:00,759
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found through the input of</font>

528
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,820
our cyber commissioners was that we

529
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:06,639
really turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> out great cyber educated</font>

530
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,210
people they come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with great academic</font>

531
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:13,119
credentials they come out ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

532
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:17,529
but they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hands-on in the</font>

533
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,908
weeds experience in order to be there

534
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:21,309
employable but then they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

535
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,720
trained again and so by building the

536
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:23,410
cyber range this could be a virtual

537
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,420
range for

538
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,280
the attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> is leading the charge on that</font>

539
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,200
one but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight centers of</font>

540
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,030
excellence for<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security around the</font>

541
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Commonwealth all of them will be part of

542
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:37,120
the advisory group but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really meant</font>

543
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a safe environment for people to</font>

544
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,489
learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do white hat activities</font>

545
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,040
play red blue games to participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

546
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,090
things like you know what is it the

547
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">national cyber competitions I can't</font>

548
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,939
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name of it now I'm drawing</font>

549
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,320
a blank but anyway there's there's

550
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,840
multiple of them at the high school

551
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,330
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we want this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

552
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,889
platform on which that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all occur so</font>

553
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,159
that every school doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to build</font>

554
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">their own right now we have a few but we</font>

555
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,780
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to cover the entire</font>

556
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,370
state and its really unfair for us for

557
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the for the folks in south side and</font>

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">southwest virginia even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hampton Roads to</font>

560
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,340
to drive to Northern Virginia that's not

561
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">fair that's that's just not right</font>

562
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,580
especially not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this day and age with</font>

563
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,960
cloud technology being what it is so

564
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,850
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build a virtual range</font>

565
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,830
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money for that</font>

566
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,050
becomes available in july and so we're

567
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,669
going to be kicking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that off pretty soon</font>

568
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,899
we also followed the federal government

569
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:35,980
model and we're establishing a

570
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,960
scholarship for service program they

571
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the federal level that</font>

572
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,830
basically if you're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cyber</font>

573
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,659
degree and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trade back</font>

574
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,580
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of service will</font>

575
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,160
pay that they'll pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years and</font>

576
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">then if you give us two years service in</font>

577
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,960
return we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to model hours</font>

578
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,540
similarly to that except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their model</font>

579
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,850
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into federal service this model</font>

580
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,470
you go into state service what that does

581
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,899
for me it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a leveling</font>

582
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:06,100
of the playing field for being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

583
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:10,660
catch good cyber professionals we as a

584
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:13,060
government don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the cool places</font>

585
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,640
for people to work we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

586
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,870
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ping-pong tables and bean bags and we</font>

587
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,670
have great people and we have great

588
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,760
facilities but it's not as cool as

589
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:23,320
Google or Facebook or Amazon we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

590
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,850
not going to compete on that level the

591
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,340
other way we can't compete is we can't

592
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,870
compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-to-one on salary never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen so we have to find creative</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually work in public service once</font>

596
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,840
they're there they're very likely to

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">stay</font>

598
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,800
because they have a gotten a taste of it

599
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,740
they like the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in a public</font>

600
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,030
service role and they're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

601
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,350
accept the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that they're not going</font>

602
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make as much as they would in the</font>

603
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,730
private sector in return for the

604
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,950
fulfillment of being a public servant

605
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,180
which is really cool we're seeing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

606
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,490
of that with the Millennials right now

607
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,810
but through the scholarship for service

608
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,700
program we hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

609
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,399
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a constant flow of people</font>

610
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,560
that experience so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have access</font>

611
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that talent we have access to those</font>

612
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,760
skills even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they leave after two</font>

613
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,950
years and somebody else when somebody

614
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,590
else comes in guess what that's refresh

615
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,640
knowledge that the state gets I don't

616
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,250
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep our people</font>

617
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,830
trained at that rate so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great</font>

618
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,200
great way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to be able to get the</font>

619
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,090
talent and keep our knowledge base as

620
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,740
current as we possibly can by bringing

621
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,330
new people in all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

622
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:32,190
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting that one in in June</font>

623
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:33,600
as well or July as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font>

624
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,930
really tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the number of</font>

625
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,209
centers of excellence for<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

626
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:41,730
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have seven universities and</font>

627
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,260
three community colleges when we started

628
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,710
we had seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> universities in one</font>

629
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,750
community college trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get all of</font>

630
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:52,970
them as many as possible certified as

631
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:55,710
centers of excellence why because

632
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,570
industry values that distinction and

633
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,720
they also know that when they hire

634
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:02,850
somebody who has come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a CAE which</font>

635
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,520
is the way they refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them that that</font>

636
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,810
skill set has been trained at a

637
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,490
guaranteed level because they know the

638
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:14,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">rigor with which those programs have</font>

639
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,500
gone to get set up and to get quantified

640
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,210
so we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited to have the two</font>

641
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,610
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have come on Tidewater</font>

642
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,020
Community College is our first<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

643
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">college outside of the Northern Virginia</font>

644
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,770
area so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to add them on we</font>

645
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,790
have a whole pipeline of others<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

646
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,580
were working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with to try to get</font>

647
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,830
certified<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lengthy process it's</font>

648
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:36,110
not an easy process and the worst part

649
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,980
for us is that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is based on</font>

650
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,409
the number of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've</font>

651
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,330
graduated so no matter how much work we

652
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,860
pour into them if it's a one if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

653
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,409
first year that they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it</font>

654
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,719
could be a perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> program but until</font>

655
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,500
graduates start coming out two years

656
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,110
later

657
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,940
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not eligible to be certified so</font>

658
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,820
the community colleges we're working

659
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">with now won't even be eligible to be</font>

660
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">certified until after we leave office</font>

661
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,440
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a disappointment</font>

662
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,300
but we feel like we see we're sowing the

663
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,520
seeds for the next for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

664
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,710
administration and next generations that

665
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,270
those will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> along but we have a long</font>

666
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,680
pipeline there and the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> college</font>

667
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">system is working very well with us</font>

668
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,240
there so we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of success in</font>

669
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that realm everybody's being really</font>

670
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,650
quiet and I'm just parroting on so you

671
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys can jump in at any point here I</font>

672
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,170
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> sowing seeds thinking that somebody</font>

673
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,220
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question about something</font>

674
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,300
but we worked really hard there the

675
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,140
other thing that we've done is we've

676
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:33,180
added a little bit of effort not a

677
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,800
little bit we've added 14 positions into

678
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,850
a public safety realm to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font>

679
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">security so we need more forensics folks</font>

680
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,139
we need more investigators we need more

681
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,910
people in a fusion center to actually

682
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,710
deal with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

683
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,540
in be able to parse it out be able to

684
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,420
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how it needs to get shared</font>

685
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,730
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've we've added 14 positions on</font>

686
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,130
that side of the house Virginia has had

687
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,180
several we've racked up a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

688
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,820
as we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font>

689
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Virginia was a first state to adopt the</font>

690
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,320
NIST cybersecurity framework we were the

691
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,210
first state to step out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be in</font>

692
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,560
declare ourselves in I saw and

695
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,950
to take executive action to make sure

00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,970
that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our credit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cards that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

have our chip-enabled I know not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

698
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,990
readers are but we're you know we're

699
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:25,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">just in our contracts we're making sure</font>

700
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,510
that everything we have is to the

highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of technology and at the</font>

702
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,830
time that was chip so we took executive

703
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,290
action on that as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

704
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,760
we really feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we've taken</font>

recommendations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Commission we've</font>

been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those in</font>

711
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,890
last year and did pretty darn well if

712
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,480
you added everything we got up it's

713
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,600
about 29 million dollars that got

714
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,179
invested it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad</font>

715
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,789
for IT investment we're pretty happy

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because we know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't</font>

conversations as the National Governors

731
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,690
Association is so we're really excited

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to be out in</font>

737
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:47,250
this fall's September 20th through 22nd

738
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,159
Virginia is hosting our first cyber and

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,380
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking at cyber security as</font>

it relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to critical infrastructure we</font>

746
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,130
feel like Virginia no other state has

747
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,158
claimed this so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're from another</font>

748
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:14,159
state plug your ears for a second nobody

749
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:18,120
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other state has really claimed the</font>

750
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,289
space of cyber and physical a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

751
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have said oh we're that you know</font>

752
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan says or where the cyber</font>

753
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:27,330
leader we're not doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot in cyber</font>

754
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:29,280
physical we have asset upon asset upon

755
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,780
asset when it start when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start to</font>

756
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,520
look at autonomy when you start to look

757
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,408
at critical infrastructure when you

758
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,408
start to look at io t we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a wealth</font>

759
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:39,600
of assets here when you layer on the

760
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:42,270
cyber assets we have on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

761
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,059
other assets we're pretty much

762
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,830
unparalleled in our ability to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

763
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,330
those topics so we're going to be

764
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,980
bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> together a lot of experts</font>

765
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:54,840
there's 275 seats that we can fill for

766
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,059
the conference so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

767
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,030
quality instead of quantity we don't

768
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,350
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big talking heads experience</font>

769
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,940
we want to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out with</font>

770
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,678
workable recommendations that the

771
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commonwealth can then feed back into the</font>

772
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,500
legislative process next year the

773
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,929
autonomy space

774
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,730
Virginia<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the six FAA test</font>

775
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,740
sites for unmanned systems if you didn't

776
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,010
know that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on that</font>

777
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,850
since about 2013 we have miles and miles

778
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:24,629
and miles of roads up on 66 29 and the

779
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:27,520
hot lanes that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> dedicated to</font>

780
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:30,880
automated vehicle testing Virginia

781
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,280
Virginia Tech has a 25 mile smart road

782
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,080
where they can simulate all sorts of

783
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">different weather climates driving</font>

784
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,120
conditions and they do it just an

785
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,570
extreme amount of automated testing out

786
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,149
there hampton roads very very flush with

787
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,370
marine environment for underwater and on

788
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,500
water testing that you know the Navy

789
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,090
wants to do and others and so we feel

790
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,280
like we've got a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> space with</font>

791
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,600
autonomy IOT and then the critical

792
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,730
infrastructure with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dominion we have</font>

793
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,010
nuclear facilities here and so we're

794
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,630
going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard when we keep</font>

795
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,980
all of these other balls in the air and

796
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,750
we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement all these things</font>

797
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,460
we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> money for we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

798
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,290
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Commonwealth forward to make</font>

799
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,450
sure that we really are not standing

800
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,220
still cybers not standing still we're

801
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,990
not standing still we want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

802
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Virginia is looking toward cyber</font>

803
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,240
physical systems as the next realm of

804
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,939
things that we can do we did a smaller

805
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,380
conference about a year ago where we

806
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:28,840
actually hacked a virginia state police

807
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:31,180
car<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a little dicey we had mitre</font>

808
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,500
and uva and some of the other groups

809
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:37,440
involved it's a whole consortium that

810
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:41,050
had been working on demonstrating the

811
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,770
potential for cyber hacks on first

812
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">responders and so they decided they came</font>

813
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">into my office one day and said hey we</font>

814
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,080
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this great idea for you for this</font>

815
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,550
unmanned systems you know little

816
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,510
conference we were doing I said what's

817
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,090
that they so we're going to hack a

818
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:58,300
virginia state police car<font color="#E5E5E5"> i fell out of</font>

819
00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:01,300
my chair and said does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> State Police</font>

820
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,530
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they said yeah yeah</font>

821
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,470
yeah we got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car from them</font>

822
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">everybody's great so I took a deep</font>

823
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,250
breath and said fine let's do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

824
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">everybody's on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> board we'll make it</font>

825
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,780
happen we did it about two days before

826
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the conference my phone rings they said</font>

827
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,490
Ford is on the line for you

828
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wow did somebody forget to call them you</font>

829
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:27,570
know of course it was a Crown Vic that

830
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were going to hack two days later and</font>

831
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:33,090
so I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> return</font>

832
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that call until like three days from now</font>

833
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:38,309
but I probably should it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

834
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:41,070
interesting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was exactly the opposite</font>

835
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:42,960
they were so excited that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

836
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,030
this research they were so excited that

837
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,350
we were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this demo to start</font>

838
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,750
to bring attention to the fact that

839
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,360
they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> our vulnerabilities they are</font>

840
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on vulnerabilities and you know</font>

841
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,870
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not one of those hair on fire</font>

842
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,059
things it's an awareness issue and it's

843
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,520
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

844
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,549
future so fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward that went very</font>

845
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">well fortunately everything was fine</font>

846
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:08,549
fast forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to about a month ago when I</font>

847
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:10,350
got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> call from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a fleet I didn't even</font>

848
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:12,929
know there were magazines about managing

849
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:15,030
fleets so I got a call from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this woman</font>

850
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:17,460
who says I want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you about</font>

851
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experience that you had with</font>

852
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,169
the hacking of the state police car I

853
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,630
thought golly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I didn't realize that</font>

854
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had made it into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> National fleet</font>

855
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,620
publication around but she was very

856
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in the experiences that we</font>

857
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,689
had had she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in the</font>

858
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:37,200
research and how it had continued beyond

859
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:39,150
just that one little demonstration that

860
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,860
we did and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we were able to put them</font>

861
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">in touch with DMV we were able to put</font>

862
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,750
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in touch with State Police and some</font>

863
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,700
of the prime investigators that had been

864
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,380
from UVA and she emailed me back a

865
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,909
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks later she said this is</font>

866
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,280
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be sorry this is going to be</font>

867
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:55,200
the best article ever she said because

868
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,760
we are so excited that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we can</font>

869
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,049
put her perspective around it it's not

870
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we need to panic about</font>

871
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:01,710
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always nice to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

872
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a state that's looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

873
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's what we always want to be</font>

874
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,339
doing we want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking forward as</font>

875
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:10,230
an as I said we've had a lot of person

876
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity we've had some first and</font>

877
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:15,090
unmanned systems as well Virginia was

878
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:19,290
the home to the first humanitarian

879
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:21,330
package delivery in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world for you</font>

880
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,750
ate by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a UAV and it happened in</font>

881
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,889
Southwest Virginia that was so exciting

882
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,949
the governor was out there to receive

883
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,419
the first package which fortunately the

884
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,710
weather and everything

885
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,770
we were actually transporting

886
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,179
pharmaceuticals as well as supplies so

887
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,859
that was a little bit dicey with the

888
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,339
different approvals that I had to go

889
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,319
through but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we got</font>

890
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">international press we were the first</font>

891
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:46,619
place to do it went off without a hitch

892
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,500
the governor<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the first governor to</font>

893
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,510
ever be interviewed by tethered drone

894
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,619
which was executive protection wasn't

895
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,159
real thrilled with me but he did it

896
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:58,589
anyway and so we made it through that

897
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,190
but it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> about pushing farther</font>

898
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:03,779
and harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you think you can it you</font>

899
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,460
know we I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when we</font>

900
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,869
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on cybersecurity we</font>

901
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,780
would come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> General Assembly</font>

00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:11,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">session with as much as we did I we</font>

903
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually just did a report from my</font>

904
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,960
office on all the accomplishments that

905
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,210
we've had across data analytics across

906
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity across all of those things</font>

907
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:24,599
and it really has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been amazing to see</font>

908
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,780
just in the two years how things have

909
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,720
progressed for our data<font color="#E5E5E5"> analytics side</font>

910
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,670
we just put out an executive order two

911
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,009
weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had been a long time in</font>

912
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,109
the making to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really come up with a</font>

914
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:43,078
Commonwealth and we gave them four

00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:44,790
months to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so we're going to be</font>

916
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,920
it we've had pieces and parts already

917
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,089
ongoing but we've given them about four

918
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,950
months to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a complete</font>

including open data as well as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

we've we've worked very very hard as you

923
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:05,010
can imagine I had a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of requests</font>

924
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,348
in along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lines over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last two</font>

925
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,180
years for data<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientists anybody want</font>

926
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:14,190
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guess as to whether those were</font>

927
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:17,190
successful in getting funded no they

928
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,410
weren't I said I need a data scientist

929
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,510
they said why I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we have all</font>

930
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,569
this data they understood the data

931
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,670
problems from the cyber side they

932
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:28,529
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at it from the</font>

933
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:32,339
efficiency side from the effectiveness

934
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:34,079
side from the the myriad of webs that

935
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,308
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be drawn and there's a lot of laws</font>

936
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,079
around how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can share information</font>

937
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">between agencies and those sorts of</font>

938
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,010
things that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

939
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,790
things that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that agencies hid</font>

940
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,010
behind

941
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,950
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to say I can't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

942
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:48,660
because there's a law that says I don't

943
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,569
know if there's a law that says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or</font>

944
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,029
not but it's easy for people to jump

945
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,820
behind and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know adore just because</font>

946
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:58,080
the doors there and so we said okay

947
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,520
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut through the doors</font>

948
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,170
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out where the real</font>

949
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,670
restrictions are we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find out</font>

950
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the real opportunities are and</font>

951
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,780
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the strategy so that's</font>

952
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:08,100
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing we're going to</font>

953
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommendations or do in October and</font>

954
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,990
we're going to hopefully move on the one

955
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,240
thing I'll add to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is over the last</font>

956
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,810
two years because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we couldn't get these</font>

957
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,459
data scientists we've actually VCU has

958
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,680
been an amazing partner with us along

959
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a couple of others to have their</font>

960
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,470
students embed with our agencies as

961
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:31,169
projects because we've need I see people

962
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:34,950
laughing in the front row because we

963
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of involvement we need</font>

964
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of talent we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

965
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,089
I guess we've had varying degrees of

966
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,460
success based on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the smiles i'm</font>

967
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,750
seeing down here on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front row some</font>

968
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,120
have worked really well some have worked

969
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,830
not so well apparently so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

970
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">very we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very pleased to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have had a</font>

971
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:54,210
partner in VCU that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been willing</font>

972
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,170
to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to borrow some of their</font>

973
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,800
students along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some of the other</font>

974
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:01,470
universities as well but take from that

975
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,240
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be very creative we're</font>

976
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,520
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very forward-thinking and</font>

977
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,649
we've got an administration right now

978
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,140
that is willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use executive action</font>

979
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,730
and legislative muscle to help the

980
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commonwealth move forward in a</font>

981
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,470
technology environment so yes sir

982
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:40,979
sure we actually put updated virginia

983
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,599
gov two years ago it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

984
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:45,779
much information on it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font>

985
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,359
no that's part of why we're doing this

986
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:49,710
strategy is because we keep saying we

987
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,690
want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to post or open date and</font>

988
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,729
everybody goes we don't have any and we

989
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,829
know they do it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of being</font>

990
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:57,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to the point of being</font>

991
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:59,759
able to post it I think it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

992
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:02,160
idea as I've mentioned I can't I can't

993
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:05,849
hire data scientist I don't have you

994
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,469
know a team of folks that are sitting

995
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:08,849
there looking at thinking about what

996
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of apps they could build for</font>

997
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:13,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">citizen services based on that data I</font>

998
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,029
don't have I don't have a bench like

999
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,890
that so be able to get that out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1000
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:19,739
public and<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow somebody actually I</font>

1001
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:23,129
think not too long ago developed an app

1002
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:26,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">about ABC stores you know just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

1003
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ABC put a bunch of data out boom</font>

1004
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,759
there was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great app about who I</font>

1005
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,650
don't know what it was on but it was

1006
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:32,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool and it was it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was something</font>

1007
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,640
that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have never been able to</font>

1008
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:37,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">have done in-house so I'm all for it as</font>

1009
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,710
much as we can push out there and we not

1010
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:42,988
jeopardize our you know our sensitive

1011
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,299
data and not you know not let any

1012
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:46,920
citizen get damaged by it I think it's a

1013
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">great idea because you guys are a lot</font>

1014
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,029
more creative<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we are so anybody</font>

1015
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,029
else have any questions yes sir

1016
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,490
thank you

1017
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,308
yeah let me take that question in half

1018
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:50,400
so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the plug for broadband</font>

1019
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:52,289
I should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> remembered so we we have</font>

1020
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the years a lot of work</font>

1021
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:57,510
we've done in broadband we have a

1022
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:59,910
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> based tool kit basically the</font>

1023
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:04,609
large providers is anybody here work for

1024
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:08,520
Verizon or Comcast or anybody I have to

1025
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:10,020
have to be careful just in case those

1026
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,020
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have built about as far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as they're</font>

1027
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to build without federal subsidy I</font>

1028
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,160
mean the cable companies are still doing

1029
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,619
some building verizon has turned down a

1030
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,788
ton of what they call calf money which

1031
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:25,980
is federal build out money Virginia had

1032
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:28,319
a significant amount of calf money that

1033
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,049
was allocated to it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Verizon did not</font>

1034
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,849
accept CenturyLink did accept it along

1035
00:41:31,049 --> 00:41:34,470
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's fair point or one</font>

1036
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:37,170
other teeny tiny little provider in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1037
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:39,180
southern part of the state so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1038
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,520
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

1039
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,038
going to be from a from an incumbent

1040
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,509
standpoint what we're trying to do and

1041
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,789
have been trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is pull down as</font>

1042
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,740
many barriers to deployment as we can so

1043
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:52,049
we worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with VDOT on rights-of-way we</font>

1044
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,729
worked on you know can we co-locate

1045
00:41:52,049 --> 00:41:56,190
stuff on state towers and on state

1046
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:57,960
buildings and really try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just take</font>

1047
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,760
down as many barriers on the on the

1048
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,680
capital side of the house as we can for

1049
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,210
the for the big guys there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a bill</font>

1050
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,009
that was just passed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cannot</font>

1051
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember the number of it but it was</font>

1052
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:09,930
delegate Randy men shoes bill that

1053
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:12,359
actually opens up bird<font color="#E5E5E5"> act roads so i</font>

1054
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:14,098
did not know when a bird act road was

1055
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,500
until this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this session but now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i know</font>

1056
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:19,710
to all of these dirt roads that you see

1057
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,839
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you drive in the hinterlands that</font>

1058
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:24,119
you might drive on it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's</font>

1059
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,130
driveway but it's a dirt road it hasn't

1060
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,720
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> paved most of those are covered by</font>

1061
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,329
what they call bird at they're covered

1062
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,520
by the bird act so the bill actually

1063
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:35,160
allows the providers to get in those

1064
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,920
roads so what happens is instead of

1065
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">having a paved road like this and a</font>

1066
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,020
paved road like this and you need to

1067
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,430
provide services<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere here and</font>

1068
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,819
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these dirt roads instead</font>

1069
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:50,308
of having to go from you know somewhere

1070
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:53,099
else to try to build back to this house

1071
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:55,529
you can go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there dirt road and have</font>

1072
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,479
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and so for some of these</font>

1073
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:59,689
communities that are down these really

1074
00:42:57,479 --> 00:43:02,069
windy roads but these dirt roads

1075
00:42:59,689 --> 00:43:04,319
basically traverse it kind of as the

1076
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:06,180
crow flies they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to actually</font>

1077
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,969
build infrastructure under those bird

1078
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">act roads and deploy services a whole</font>

1079
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:13,049
lot more cost effectively than going on

1080
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,939
the main roads so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a big deal</font>

1081
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:16,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was a big deal that the cable</font>

1082
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:19,828
companies were hoping that that will

1083
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:21,269
facilitate them building some

1084
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,439
infrastructure out pretty quickly the

1085
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:24,988
other thing that we've done and

1086
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:28,499
providers didn't like this was there's

1087
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:31,199
currently a broadband crowdsourcing

1088
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:34,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity online right now it's called</font>

1089
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,900
are you online va thank you for

1090
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,660
reminding me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say something about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1091
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,400
there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> before anybody says why</font>

1092
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,038
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you giving them a one why are you</font>

1093
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:48,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving them a web page to report that</font>

1094
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:53,459
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadband we thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1095
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:54,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we gave you a 1 877 number but you</font>

1096
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:56,879
what you would be not you were

1097
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:58,469
completely be surprised at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

1098
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,199
emails I've gotten over the last week

00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:03,209
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says that's really dumb why did you</font>

1100
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">give people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a web page to fill out to</font>

1101
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:07,799
tell you they don't have broadband and

1102
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,839
have to remind them if you had read one

1103

fill it out you can fill it out from a

1107
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:20,609
library for your home when I came in on

1108
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:22,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">two or and just about midday on tuesday</font>

1109
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:25,558
it had been open for about a week we had

1110
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:28,078
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5,000 responses so we feel like</font>

1111
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,640
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well on that the</font>

1112
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,559
providers were not happy with that at

1113
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,299
all and I know I'm running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of time</font>

1114
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:38,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">now wish me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask that earlier we have</font>

1115
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:40,049
a provider map we have a broadband

1116
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,599
provider map but it's based on census

1117
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:44,549
block so we catch a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flak and that</font>

1118
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,859
was that was the federal data model

1119
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,939
there's a whole history on broadband in

1120
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:50,670
the Commonwealth but that's a different

1121
00:44:47,939 --> 00:44:53,160
that's a different day but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we lost</font>

1122
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,839
granularity when the feds put their data

1123
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,178
model out because we were basing our

1124
00:44:54,839 --> 00:45:00,630
collection and<font color="#E5E5E5"> data partnerships on</font>

1125
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:02,219
address level they backed off and said

1126
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,910
that providers could give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">National</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">create a map that was less granular than</font>

the one we had we took the money and we

1131
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,979
built a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools we've</font>

1132
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,319
built propagation tools we built

1133
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,059
databases on policy around towers all

1134
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,880
those sorts of things the money was well

1135
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,410
spent but we lost granularity and so

1136
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,240
what we did is we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> kicked a lot in</font>

1137
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:29,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the shins and well your map shows that I</font>

1138
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,439
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> service when I don't well now we're</font>

1139
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming out to the citizens and saying</font>

1140
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,849
okay you're saying our map is wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1141
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:38,240
overstated and we agree with you but

1142
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:41,099
that's what the feds told us to map to

1143
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,759
you give us the address level data and

1144
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:46,920
we'll go back and hone the map so it's a

1145
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a bit of a reality check</font>

1146
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,299
for the providers because now we're

1147
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,880
getting the data address by address

1148
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:56,819
rather than by census<font color="#CCCCCC"> block and so we</font>

1149
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,559
continue to push we continue there's a

1150
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money in the budget this</font>

1151
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,740
year it's about two and a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font>

1152
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,868
each year for build-out that's not going

1153
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,700
to solve the problem we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1154
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:07,020
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be continued to be creative we're</font>

1155
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,149
going to have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to push these</font>

1156
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,890
guys I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing that</font>

1157
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,690
citizenry doesn't understand completely

1158
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:15,450
is broadband is not a regulated service

1159
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:19,230
it's not like telephone service it's not

1160
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:23,149
like electric I can't make them do

1161
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:25,859
anything so i'm down to carrots and i

1162
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:28,619
really got no sticks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's</font>

1163
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:30,720
carrots and these guys want<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big</font>

1164
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,910
carrots and so we continue to push we

1165
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,770
don't think we're done<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet but we're</font>

1166
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,839
trying to really hone in on the unserved

1167
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,640
areas because we don't think it's fair

1168
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:40,470
for our kids to not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do their</font>

1169
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,900
homework at home we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

1170
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,589
fair for you know people not to be able

1171
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,670
to from to work from<font color="#CCCCCC"> home or age at home</font>

1172
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:50,099
everybody should just have equal access

1173
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,990
and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult thing to tell</font>

1174
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,390
a citizen that there's really not a

1175
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,950
whole lot you can do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> by highlighting</font>

1176
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,058
these holes and really shining some

1177
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,279
light on and we're hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

1178
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:01,859
target resources to make sure that

1179
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:03,359
everybody has a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get service so</font>

1180
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:07,038
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your question let me grab</font>

1181
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">him and I'll come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to you yes sir</font>

1182
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:18,640
um yes and no part of the problem with

1183
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,680
the mobile any of the mobile

1184
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,830
technologies is the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> caps in the</font>

1185
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:26,529
price a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks that we find</font>

1186
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had they do have access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cellular</font>

1187
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:30,520
whether it's through a mifi or whether

1188
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,110
it's through their phone for kids doing

1189
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,420
homework phones are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

1190
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,100
medium to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that so we</font>

1191
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,750
prefer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we really want people</font>

1192
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,549
to have options<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if they need it</font>

1193
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can use it on a phone that's</font>

1194
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,360
great but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need it to do to run a</font>

1195
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">business or they need something that's</font>

1196
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,980
more secure or calm you know complex

1197
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,629
then we want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1198
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:53,530
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a wireless connection</font>

1199
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:55,390
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've got TV white space pilots</font>

1200
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:58,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on with Microsoft and mid</font>

atlantic broadband mid-atlantic or<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1202
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,869
not sure who announced it but we just

1203
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,760
found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the biggest</font>

1204
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:05,710
transatlantic broadband crossings is

1205
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,660
going to come into virginia beach that

1206
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,790
was announced earlier in the week we

1207
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,250
don't we're kind of technology agnostic

1208
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,690
at this point the only thing the only

1209
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,490
problems that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we start</font>

1210
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:18,790
talking about cellular we start talking

1211
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:21,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">about satellite is cost because it gets</font>

1212
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,840
so expensive so quickly that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1213
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,119
times that just doesn't match up with

1214
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,010
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve the needs of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1215
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,050
folks that are currently unserved so

1216
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,820
they're in there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have it</font>

1217
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,700
mapped based on different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

1218
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,830
technologies but we we try to steer away

1219
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,180
from that verizon is actually there was

1220
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bill in the legislature this year</font>

1221
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:42,009
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> small cell antennas because when</font>

1222
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:45,520
you move to 5g which it's coming and

1223
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,410
it's coming quickly the cells that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1224
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,000
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> put up or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the behemoth cell</font>

1225
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,950
towers anymore they can be put up on

1226
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,530
mass or they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> put upon church</font>

1227
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:55,569
steeples or pretty much anything because

1228
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,710
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> small the only problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1229
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,770
they have to be placed really close

1230
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:02,500
together Virginia because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way</font>

1231
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,810
where the way we're structured each

1232
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,400
locality has their own rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1233
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,290
provider has to go from County to County

1234
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,270
to County to County to County to place

1235
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,950
those antennas so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1236
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:13,869
some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to globalize some</font>

1237
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:15,279
of the requirements and stuff around 52

1238
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:17,319
so that it can propagate more quickly

1239
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,759
but it's

1240
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:21,009
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to be a whole lot</font>

1241
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:22,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of agreement on the party municipalities</font>

1242
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:24,160
and and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily the state</font>

1243
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,288
because we probably have the least

1244
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,299
amount of input at the local level about

1245
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:30,789
where these cells can be placed we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1246
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:32,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lot of say but we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

1247
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:35,049
municipalities<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if there's some</font>

1248
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:38,019
way to kind of smooth out the variation

1249
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:39,369
in permitting requirements and fees and

1250
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:41,379
all those sorts of things so that a

1251
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:42,880
vendor doesn't have to sign you know

1252
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,400
hundred different agreements they can

1253
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,900
sign one or two so it's all in there I

1254
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,170
mean we're happy to see whatever

1255
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,759
technology take place that that's coming

1256
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:54,670
along but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to be in at a price</font>

1257
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:56,019
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> and reasonable with the data side</font>

1258
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the house because some of us just too</font>

1259
00:49:56,019 --> 00:50:01,890
expensive yes sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay somebody in the</font>

1260
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,890
back

1261
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">did you on the rural electric poles is</font>

1262
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,670
that what you're saying

you

00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:43,009
yeah we that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most at it</font>

1265
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,690
you probably may remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they pole</font>

attachment fights that have been had in

1267
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:52,220
the legislature very quickly we have we

1268
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,530
have municipal electrics and we have

1269
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,799

bigger providers those type providers

<font color="#E5E5E5">pole attachment cost is governed by a</font>

1274
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,550
formula at the federal level so they can

1275
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">only charge so much per pole for you it</font>

1276
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:15,140
to attach anything to them when you get

1277
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:19,520
into the rural areas though a lot of

1278

their services on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the electric side come</font>

from coops they come from member<font color="#E5E5E5"> coops</font>

1281
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,800
regulated by the rule or by the formula

1282
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,500
so they can charge whatever they want to

1283
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">on per pole attachments so we've had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1284
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:38,720
lot of very testy debates about pole

1285
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,760
attachment fees in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rural areas</font>

1286
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,169
because it makes it cost prohibitive for

1287
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,569
some of these providers to get into

1288
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:46,220
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we've ended up is</font>

1289
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:48,940
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a process at the State</font>

1290
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:52,459
Corporation Commission that if a

1291
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:54,740
provider and a co-op can't come together

1292
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:57,559
on pricing that they can go have that

1293
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,689
situation mediated in an attempt to try

1294
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:01,880
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the services out to the rural</font>

1295
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,410
areas so I mean we push everything we're

1296
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,849
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push it in and V dot rights</font>

1297
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,339
away we're trying to push it on state

1298
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:09,069
buildings you know you can attach to

1299
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:12,308
pretty much anything the<font color="#CCCCCC"> state's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1300
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:14,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">state police might say that differently</font>

1301
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:16,849
but theoretically you can attach to

1302
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,920
pretty much anything we've got but the

1303
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:21,559
polls have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a particular angst</font>

1304
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,530
because again it's not something that's

1305
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:26,839
that's regulated like it is with

1306
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,640
Dominion and with aep and so we've

1307
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:30,770
fought that fight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell</font>

1308
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,348
you that those battles got so hot and

1309
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:35,030
heavy that personal friendships that had

1310
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:36,740
existed for like 20 years fortunately

1311
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,660
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were mine don't exist</font>

1312
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:42,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore because there was such</font>

1313
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:43,460
contention between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coop folks and</font>

1314
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,339
the actual provider folks so we're

1315
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,840
trying but an absent going through that

1316
00:52:46,339 --> 00:52:50,450
state corporation

1317
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,880
it I have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told that actually the</font>

1318
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:54,290
providers went to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> coops and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

1319
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,850
look if you'll just give us access to

1320
00:52:54,290 --> 00:53:00,680
the polls will give service to your

1321
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:04,130
customers and they said no<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I I</font>

1322
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:06,879
don't know what I do with that so didn't

1323
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,880
somebody yes sir

1324
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,269
wow that we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> several deployments</font>

around<font color="#CCCCCC"> lovingston we had a couple</font>

called I<font color="#E5E5E5"> BEC that was doing some</font>

1328
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:30,939
deployments down there ham radio

1329
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:33,769
operators were not happy with them um I

1330
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">BEC eventually folded and I don't know</font>

1331
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:37,029
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's even one broadband a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tree</font>

1335
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:48,769
struck Switzerland with the ham radio

1336
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,150
operators but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard anything</font>

1337

about it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years i'm</font>

1338
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,950
assuming when that company folded it

1339
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:58,129
just it just went away so if they could

1340

<font color="#E5E5E5">make it work yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i think those</font>
