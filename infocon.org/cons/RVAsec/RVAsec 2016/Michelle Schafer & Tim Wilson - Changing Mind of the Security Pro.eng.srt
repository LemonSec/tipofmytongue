9
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,820
little bit about security in the media

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,949
and I guess I should tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

trays talk that you know you can put

move about the cabin so we're we're

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,160
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about where</font>

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,078
you get your information when you're a

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,559
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional where do you you</font>

know find the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,789
where you get what you get whether it's

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,500
reliable or not and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set</font>

20
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:12,030
priorities based on the on the

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">information that you're getting and</font>

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,229
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about</font>

23
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:20,340
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sausage-making that goes on</font>

24
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:23,190
behind the<font color="#CCCCCC"> development of the news and</font>

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,950
how the news works so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,259
factor that in to what you're reading

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,330
and what you're seeing and and whether

28
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,179
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you how much credence you put in</font>

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:40,020
to the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're getting</font>

30
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:42,569
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's good so I'll start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off a</font>

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,020
little bit i'm giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to give</font>

32
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,360
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some information dark reading you</font>

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,720
guys read dark reading you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good dark reading is part</font>

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,610
of the same company that runs black hat

36
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,340
as well so we're doing in the process

37
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now doing a survey of black hat</font>

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,000
attendees past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> present on a lot of</font>

39
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things but one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we asked them about is sort of you</font>

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,489
know what keeps them awake at night and

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,109
where they get their information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

43
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,700
they make decisions and that kind of

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,989
stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to share a little bit</font>

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,700
of data with you it's a this is data

46
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,440
that just came in there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> report</font>

47
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,319
associated with it you're that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,510
actually the first ones to hear it so

49
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,399
but it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same one it's it's a symbol</font>

50
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,219
we did a similar study last year so this

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,600
is this year's numbers so when we asked

52
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,780
people

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,030
and again black hat attendees so high

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,890
intensity security pros for the most

55
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,520
part you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are your biggest</font>

56
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,869
worries so we gave them a long list of

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,460
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually was longer than</font>

58
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:58,080
this list but the the first thing the

59
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:00,390
top item on the list was fishing social

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,160
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> second one was sophisticated</font>

61
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,720
and targeted attacks there are the

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,270
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you don't</font>

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,890
know right you're there you're there

64
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,900
stuff going on and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sense</font>

65
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,760
that you don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find it and</font>

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,000
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of keep</font>

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,459
you awake at night vulnerabilities

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,800
introduced by in internally developed

69
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,420
apps you know the kind of stuff that's

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,540
your coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your development</font>

71
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">teams data theft and sabotage by</font>

72
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,910
malicious insiders it's again you know

73
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,399
the things that could cause the most

74
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,220
damage that you're least likely to know

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,340
about so not a big surprise here but you

76
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,980
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

77
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,460
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked questions like you know what's</font>

78
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,579
the company's risk status what where are

79
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you with compliance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font>

80
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">all ranked at the bottom you know these</font>

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not the things that are keeping</font>

82
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:59,010
people awake at night but interestingly

83
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,380
the things that when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask them how</font>

84
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">they spend their time or what their</font>

85
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,230
management is concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,420
things ranked very high right so risk

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">management how to evaluate and come up</font>

88
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,730
with a risk model for for the

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,730
organization what what are the where are

90
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:22,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">we as a company and things like</font>

91
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,650
compliance another issue that's very

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,690
high on the managers scale but they're

93
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,320
very low on the security professionals

94
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:35,430
scale so lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of disconnects</font>

95
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">there when we asked security pros where</font>

96
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,700
to where<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you get your information you</font>

97
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,200
know the latest threats what you're

98
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,080
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be working on that day what are</font>

99
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,979
you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

100
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,599
do that day what's what's important they

101
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,330
they talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about lots of different</font>

102
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:53,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">things security researcher blogs ended</font>

103
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:57,090
up being number one and then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> T news</font>

104
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:59,620
media so dark reading type publications

105
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,330
ranked at the top and then conferences

106
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,919
like this you know where you where you

107
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,109
know you're getting information from

108
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,520
reliable sources and and that sort of

109
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,400
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it starts to tail off a</font>

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,500
little bit in terms of reliability you

111
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,719
know colleagues<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty six percent said</font>

112
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,120
you know I get stuff from people i work

113
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:18,039
with or people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know vulnerability</font>

114
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,949
reporting sites and and that sort of

115
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,449
thing as Trey was talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

116
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,229
you know you get a lot of stuff from

117
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:29,050
Twitter not always sure how reliable it

118
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:31,449
is and it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in very small amounts so</font>

119
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,490
you can't always process it you know it

120
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know something happen but</font>

121
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,870
you don't get your on a lot of details

122
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:43,930
so that's that's sort of where they get

123
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:46,000
their data from we asked them what do

124
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,539
you think gets too much attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">know when when you read in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the media</font>

126
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,800
security blogger sites you read in

127
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube let's talk about at conferences</font>

128
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,710
what you know what's what's what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

129
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,388
get too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so they talked about</font>

130
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like governments of surveillance</font>

131
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:07,779
you know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the NSA is</font>

132
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">watching us China espionage by foreign</font>

133
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,259
governments you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sense was you</font>

134
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,710
know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting too much of that</font>

135
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:18,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff hacktivists you know the</font>

136
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">anonymous's and and organizations like</font>

137
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:22,599
that interestingly ransomware was

138
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,460
actually ranked fairly high because some

139
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:29,080
people felt like you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

140
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:32,378
too much attention and then we asked

141
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,180
them what gets too little attention what

142
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,770
you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get when you when you</font>

143
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,870
read in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media you look at Twitter</font>

144
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,810
you know what what are you not getting

145
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,419
enough information about so accidental

146
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,639
data leaks so the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen</font>

147
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,409
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day to you because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody didn't</font>

148
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,860
follow security policy or you know and

149
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,750
all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise</font>

150
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,610
fishing and

151
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,970
those those sorts of attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the social</font>

152
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,740
engineering stuff and then but

153
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,080
interestingly we start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see some of</font>

154
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that were on the list of too</font>

155
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,870
much we also see as being not enough so

156
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,370
government severe surveillance some

157
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,590
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really worried about you know</font>

158
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,400
how much surveillance are we getting and

159
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,979
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are you know feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like they</font>

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,870
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care so you start to see where</font>

161
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:24,110
things begin to it begins to depend on

162
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,240
who you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's important and that's</font>

163
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:30,770
where and that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

164
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:37,110
begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the media</font>

165
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:39,870
covers so we know that what what's

166
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,820
important to you may not be what's

167
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,600
important to the media so the media is

168
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,240
looking for stuff that's new right so if

169
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,490
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with sequel injection or</font>

170
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
you know buffer overflow stuff like that

171
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,390
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very sexy from a news</font>

172
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,650
perspective so then you won't find a lot

173
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:03,539
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage about it you know if you're</font>

174
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:07,200
you know focused in on you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

175
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,090
hottest and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most interesting threats</font>

176
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,120
you know medical devices you know cars

177
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,859
that can be sent off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road and drones</font>

178
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,850
that can be controlled you know those

179
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,760
are all things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really</font>

180
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,400
interesting from a security perspective

181
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,140
but they don't they don't have impact on

182
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,729
most of you because you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you're not managing those things</font>

184
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:32,780
every day and for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

185
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,860
organizations the media organizations

186
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,439
there and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a little</font>

187
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,719
bit about how they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're</font>

188
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,969
focused on what can bring the most

189
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,300
eyeballs but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

190
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:49,050
what's most important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so you're</font>

191
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know some topics that are</font>

192
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,880
being overhyped some you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know big</font>

193
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,839
headlines that sort of thing we're going

194
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk a little bit about branded bugs</font>

195
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,120
you know the heart bleeds and the

196
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,980
poodles and the

197
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,750
things that have a little logo and they

198
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,250
have their name and you know they get

199
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,410
and people get excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

200
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,480
because they're marketed really well and

201
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,630
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about</font>

202
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,450
how what you consider to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

203
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,720
reliable sources which by our data is

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:26,020
you know security<font color="#CCCCCC"> experts media and</font>

205
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,180
conferences can be influenced by lots of

206
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,650
different factors and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

207
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,349
talk a little bit about how these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

208
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,839
happen how these things are brought to

209
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,760
you and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can have a little</font>

210
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,140
bit more sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a filter you know as to</font>

211
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,900
what you accept and what you don't

212
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">accept you know as far as new</font>

213
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:52,060
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of the things that</font>

214
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,250
happens to all of us in the media's is

215
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,069
that we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected by PR and</font>

216
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,360
marketing organizations who sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put</font>

217
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,180
these things together whether it's

218
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,490
branded bugs the product messages or you

219
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,500
know those kinds of things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michelle</font>

220
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:11,260
is going to talk a little bit about how

221
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:14,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happens so we all read the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

222
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,580
right and we all see lots of stuff out

223
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">there it's a very noisy crowded market</font>

224
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,330
you know there's a ton of security

225
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,420
vendors and you know when i started

226
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing cybersecurity PR 13 years ago</font>

227
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,219
there was probably really only you know

228
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,330
20 maybe 30 companies that you really

229
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,430
knew and you heard from pretty

230
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,709
frequently today there are fourteen

231
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,660
hundred plus cyber security vendors out

232
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:41,800
there and so that's what's creating a

233
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,660
ton of this noise but as a result we're

234
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,770
seeing that products and technologies

235
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,319
are completely overblown it's causing a

236
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of confusion and a lot of false</font>

237
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,270
claims in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market about technologies</font>

238
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,550
and you hear best in breed or you know

239
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,430
industry-leading<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and all these</font>

240
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,779
claims about these technologies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

241
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,579
can you really prove it it's pretty

242
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,130
tough unless you're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're using</font>

243
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the product we hear about security</font>

244
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,070
vulnerabilities all the time every

245
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,990
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and you know what maybe I'm</font>

246
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,460
guilty of it too I am a PR and I'm a

247
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,840
market

248
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,640
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I work with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

249
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,260
marketing teams and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

250
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the news out there</font>

251
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:26,930
but it's gotten to a point where there's

252
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:29,250
a lot of concern and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

253
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,079
confusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what's real and what's</font>

254
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,760
not and what the goal of these

255
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,080
vulnerabilities really is and what's

256
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">really behind it from a marketing</font>

257
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,000
perspective and then we're finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

258
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,610
new issues and threats are taking over

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,860
old ones so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it the</font>

260
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,810
OWASP top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 vulnerabilities that list</font>

261
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,240
doesn't change year after<font color="#CCCCCC"> year it's the</font>

262
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,949
same bugs that come up these are the

263
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,210
most important things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that IT security</font>

264
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,070
professionals should actually be

265
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,290
addressing but this noise and this

266
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:00,770
confusion this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very crowded market is</font>

267
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,770
causing a big i would say tornado effect

268
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,500
but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it starts with sort of the</font>

269
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,990
headlines and hot markets drive big

270
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,820
headlines and over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past few years</font>

271
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,970
we've seen a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these hot sexy</font>

272
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,190
markets think endpoint security threat

273
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,810
intelligence incident response there's a

274
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of attention that's being given to</font>

275
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,729
certain sexy areas of these technologies

276
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a lot of that has to do with many</font>

277
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,670
factors so number one venture capital

278
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,500
funding we're seeing a ton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> VC money</font>

279
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,020
that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been dumped into certain</font>

280
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,330
companies and that causes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of this</font>

281
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,430
overblown<font color="#E5E5E5"> hype you know if a VC is</font>

definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> draws eyeballs that catches</font>

285
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,339
the media's attention and it also

286
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,199
catches the attention of the whole

these<font color="#CCCCCC"> technologies and special reports</font>

they're important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're a great</font>

way of getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and getting</font>

298
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,939
that sort of validation in the market

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">but again you know if you think about</font>

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way the analysts work it is a lot of</font>

it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for play you know if you are</font>

308
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,370
product coverage it's very very

309
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,930
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get like I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

310
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago when i started doing this it was</font>

311
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,829
pretty easy to actually call up a

312
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,780
reporter at network world and tell him

313
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I had a new firewall and they would</font>

314
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,500
write about it and that was great

315
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,600
because it got you know my client great

316
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,950
coverage it was all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their product</font>

317
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and technology and how great it was</font>

318
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:59,190
today reporters will not do that it is

319
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,650
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough to get a solid piece of</font>

320
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,800
product coverage because again we're

321
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,540
competing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,400 other vendors that</font>

322
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,839
are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their technology is the</font>

323
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,579
greatest and reporters want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive</font>

324
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,960
headlines and they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that product</font>

325
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,720
coverage really isn't going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

326
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,060
for them you know that's why as PR

327
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,950
professionals we take the tack these

328
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,900
days to combine your product coverage

329
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,240
with something else we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to basically</font>

330
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,480
bring something a little bit more beefy

331
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,970
juicy headline worthy to a reporter in

332
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,100
order to get them to write and that is

333
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,820
what is also causing a lot of this sort

334
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,530
of tornado effect and PR pros they just

335
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,050
know this that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of this magic</font>

336
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,030
recipe you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analyst</font>

337
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,160
validation you get Gartner to say you're

338
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,750
great you get your product news which

339
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,490
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out anyway you get a</font>

340
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,960
venture capital that's funded you and

341
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,120
you go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> promote that news and</font>

342
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,070
then you couple it with this great

343
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
threat report with these you know

344
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,670
vulnerabilities or these new threats

345
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,250
that your company is found and that

346
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:03,930
creates<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good headline so let's talk</font>

347
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some major vulnerabilities that</font>

348
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,209
have made<font color="#E5E5E5"> major headlines and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

349
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you guys saw a lot of the news around</font>

350
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,670
bad luck earlier this year how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of</font>

351
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">you felt that it was pretty much over</font>

352
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,569
hyped all right well you are correct and

353
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,030
in fact when I went back and I looked at

354
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,730
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the articles around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad luck in</font>

355
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:29,819
particular I saw reporters you know

356
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,280
industry you know gurus the CTO of

357
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualis many people that basically looked</font>

358
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,480
at this vulnerability and said this was

359
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,820
all a marketing ploy it was all over

360
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,470
Twitter there was definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort</font>

361
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,529
of spiral effect about this particular

362
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,079
vulnerability

363
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,120
but what it did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think was raised</font>

364
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,449
awareness to the problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font>

365
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,089
today because you know I had never<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

366
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,829
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that plethora that amount of</font>

367
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,050
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of criticism towards one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

368
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,599
vulnerabilities the way bad luck was

369
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,359
definitely negatively perceived by

370
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,879
everyone in the industry and after a lot

371
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">of digging what was supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be you</font>

372
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:10,629
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a bug turned out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

373
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,279
man-in-the-middle denial of service

374
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:15,639
vulnerability and it was all over hyped

375
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:18,970
so I think that was just probably the

376
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:22,059
most recent worst example of the

377
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:26,069
overhyped vulnerability looking back

378
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:28,089
last year the carbon act gang and 2015

379
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,649
kaspersky you know they have a great

380
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">threat lab they do a great job of</font>

381
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:35,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting great vulnerability data out</font>

382
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:38,439
there do it very strict<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of</font>

383
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,899
going in and out so every year<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

384
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:42,849
his fierce keys cyber security<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysts</font>

385
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,279
summit and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that event which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

386
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,439
some wonderful place on an island you

387
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,089
know Puerto Rico or the Bahamas or

388
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:51,939
wherever they do it spain i think this

389
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:54,160
past year they invite security reporters

390
00:16:51,939 --> 00:17:02,759
and bloggers to come and what they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

391
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:07,480
they biggest juiciest and this path

392
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:11,589
criticism around this carbon act gang it

393
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,880
disclosed because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can still</font>

394
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:18,938
hear me right for 14 years you can hear

395
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,399
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so what we saw was that</font>

396
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,630
people were criticizing kaspersky

397
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:25,270
because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually knew about a</font>

398
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,890
vulnerability and they held on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

399
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,700
several months for marketing purposes

400
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,020
and you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry has looked</font>

401
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,630
a little bit like a head scratcher

402
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,549
because you know if you have a threat

403
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,860
that's out there in the wild shouldn't

404
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:41,049
you disclose it properly and shouldn't

405
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,250
it be fixed this vulnerability was

406
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,620
running around for a while before

407
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,470
anything ever actually happened but what

408
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:51,459
was also interesting is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when the</font>

409
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,919
news came out FSI sac and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the American</font>

410
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,710
Bankers Association they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually said</font>

411
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,450
this wasn't

412
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,830
it had been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while they knew</font>

413
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the vulnerability they were seeing</font>

414
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,330
it at some of the financial institutions

415
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:05,059
and the banks so it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of looked</font>

416
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,049
very sketchy you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

417
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it from a marketing perspective</font>

418
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:10,490
and what the industry really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed I</font>

419
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">think by far everybody knows about</font>

420
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,539
heartbleed and this was the first time

421
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,250
we'd really seen back in 2014 a

422
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,379
vulnerability that had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website of its</font>

423
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:25,669
own and a nice pretty little logo of its

424
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,049
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know i think you know if you</font>

425
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,500
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all the coverage that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> harp</font>

426
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lee got and how much it still gets today</font>

427
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,880
you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just past the two-year</font>

428
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,980
anniversary of heart bleed but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

429
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,770
see it referenced as one of the biggest

430
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,690
vulnerabilities in history yes I'm not

431
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,250
undermining that it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> serious</font>

432
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,350
threat but if you just look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

433
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,010
marketing tactics around it again

434
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,860
another head scratcher and you it's

435
00:18:49,010 --> 00:19:00,110
interesting it goes way back you can

436
00:18:51,860 --> 00:19:03,260
look at was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> 34</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago right at the</font>

437
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">time of RSA McAfee talked about shady</font>

438
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:09,830
rat and it got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attention and the</font>

439
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,580
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year they came back with something</font>

440
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:15,470
called night dragon which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

441
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,980
nothing in the in the end but it was

442
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,140
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out with RSA if you look at</font>

443
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 60 minutes report that was done</font>

444
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:27,080
on configure if you ever get a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

445
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:30,080
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and watch it again the only person</font>

446
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,689
that talks in that entire segment is is

447
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,870
the researcher from Symantec it

448
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:41,990
reporters can be duped especially on

449
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:44,270
very technical new vulnerabilities they

450
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,260
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't they're not very</font>

451
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:51,230
good filters and so when you see stuff

452
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,850
in the news particularly in the

453
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,980
mainstream news like the wall street

454
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:57,230
journal's and and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new york times and</font>

455
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,000
and those sorts of things were the

456
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:03,020
reporters don't sort of eat sleep and

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,299
breathe security watch what you see

458
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,370
because and and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know give it some</font>

459
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,150
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we read everything</font>

460
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,030
you can

461
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,680
and because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we'll</font>

462
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about this some more is you know</font>

463
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,220
your executives coming saying you know I

464
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,020
saw this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wall street journal is</font>

465
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,670
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front page today you know what</font>

466
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,800
are we doing about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when in fact</font>

467
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,600
it's it's not something that that's

468
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really going to affect you and it's</font>

469
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly because a reporter got sucked in</font>

470
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,169
somewhere whether they shouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

471
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,600
do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say the names that they come</font>

472
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,300
up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pretty darn creative the</font>

473
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,899
Melissa virus I love you<font color="#CCCCCC"> this dates me</font>

474
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:42,440
but hey been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while so what's</font>

475
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,970
this tornado effect of crazy headlines

476
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,980
causing a lot of questions in our minds

477
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,350
you know do the security teams out there

478
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually view these vulnerabilities as</font>

479
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,840
real or serious does it confuse them

480
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,240
even more I'd say yes pretty confidently

481
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,209
to that question and are these threats

482
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,640
being patched and with marketing teams

483
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,740
overhyping these zero-day threats and

484
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,630
announcing them before a patch is

485
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,400
actually available are we actually

486
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,860
allowing the cyber criminals and the

487
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,660
malware authors a head start giving a

488
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,219
more time to actually exploit them I'd

489
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,170
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes and does it help or hurt a brand</font>

490
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,020
to put out report these you know big

491
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,160
sexy reports and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as are we seeing some</font>

492
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these security vendors out there</font>

493
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:32,450
losing brand credibility because there's

494
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:34,490
too many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so yes I'd say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes to a</font>

495
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:39,230
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these it's causing a big headache</font>

496
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:41,360
in the industry so I think what we want

497
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,130
to do now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of take a step back</font>

498
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and take a look inside the media</font>

499
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,960
landscape I work with journalists like

500
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,370
Tim every day my team works<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font>

501
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,960
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working with these guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

502
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,929
long time we know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're up</font>

503
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,260
against and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> pressure-filled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

504
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,210
environment is to cover news so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

505
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to talk a little bit about what</font>

506
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:05,000
Tim's life is like and Tim feel free to

507
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,310
feel free to pipe in here not to put

508
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">words in your mouth but reporters are</font>

509
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,600
evaluated by how much audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

510
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,430
drive so they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the big</font>

511
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,520
story they need the headline grabber

512
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:19,520
that's what their editors want they want

513
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,299
lots of readers lots of circulation they

514
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,489
need to basically hit numbers

515
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,710
they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the stories that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

516
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:28,259
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interest the average person on</font>

517
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,299
the street or a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone</font>

518
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">is heard of and they're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

519
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,019
breaking news stories that have

520
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,090
immediacy something that just broke you

521
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,289
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days are good for that you</font>

522
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,320
know those new vulnerabilities we were

523
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:43,440
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and reporters are also</font>

524
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,299
driven by advertising the more content

525
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,789
pages they have the more money they make

526
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:50,700
it's a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> equation and they're</font>

527
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:52,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking to define a specific demographic</font>

528
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,659
that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seem more unique to the</font>

529
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,149
advertiser and then they compete with

530
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other for advertising dollars so</font>

531
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:01,498
again if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that more</font>

532
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:04,678
stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> more dollars more advertising it</font>

533
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:07,230
all is important for journalism to

534
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,299
maintain you know it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being and</font>

535
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,690
its existence today well it's it's it's

536
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:15,749
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of convolution of two</font>

537
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,359
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things 11 as a journalist your</font>

538
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:20,159
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to is to give you the most</font>

539
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:24,928
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> information with the most</font>

540
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:28,230
useful information but because we serve

541
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:31,169
advertisers I have to deliver next month

542
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:34,440
I have to deliver a million pageviews so

543
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:35,639
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at stories that you know</font>

544
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots and lots of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to</font>

545
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:41,580
write read and that their and their

546
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:43,289
stories that are and the sexier they are

547
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,439
the more people were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read those</font>

548
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:49,169
so if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> write you know a buffalo story</font>

549
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,529
you know and I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> 137 hits that's not</font>

550
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:53,879
helping so but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand that</font>

551
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:57,509
might be the problem that you're dealing

552
00:23:53,879 --> 00:24:00,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">with today that that is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

553
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:03,779
important so it's sort of an extremely

554
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:06,330
example but we're constantly in a battle

555
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,899
between you know what's most important

556
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,549
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what's most useful to you and</font>

557
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:13,379
what will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the biggest readership and</font>

558
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,649
those are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font>

559
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:18,719
actually true story so about six or

560
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:21,570
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago I pitched him and his</font>

561
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">team to meet with one of my former</font>

562
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,100
clients which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> password manager</font>

563
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:28,200
company and Tim told me that one of the

564
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,730
only reasons why<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was going to help</font>

565
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know have Sarah one of his editors</font>

566
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,629
take this meeting was because they had

567
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:34,260
written a story in dark reading I don't

568
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:36,629
know a tour

569
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,770
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> about top password managers</font>

570
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,460
and he said it was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most</font>

571
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:43,560
widely read pieces and so in my pitch

572
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with Tim and his team he said</font>

573
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,610
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do a follow-up story to</font>

574
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,800
this password manager piece because this

575
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,540
actually will drive a lot of readers if

576
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,720
it did it before hopefully it'll do it

577
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,730
again and so lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me got the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story</font>

578
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,580
got the client in there and it was great

579
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,740
coverage but product coverage isn't

580
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,270
something that you guys ever do normally

581
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,980
but in the case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you made the</font>

582
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,160
exception just because that one story

583
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,510
drove so many readers well you know it's

584
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you look up in google</font>

585
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you know so you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for you</font>

586
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">know your company is thinking about</font>

587
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,080
buying a password manager thinking about

588
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,270
a next-generation firewall or thinking

589
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,370
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a laugh or you know those kinds of</font>

590
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:27,000
things and so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a story</font>

591
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:30,239
that's kind of serves<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so you know</font>

592
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,920
10 best laughs you know 10 best password

593
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,810
managers those are the stories that end

594
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:39,960
up you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we have we did a story geez</font>

595
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,760
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was at network computing 12 years</font>

596
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago or something like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it has</font>

597
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,890
a title like something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how to</font>

598
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,169
configure a firewall and it's still one

599
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the best stories that they get that</font>

600
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:54,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets read on network computing and it is</font>

601
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,030
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know really simple stuff</font>

602
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,860
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess the lesson you take</font>

603
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,690
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that is be sure to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check the</font>

604
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:04,219
date when you're doing you're googling

605
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,220
because some of the stuff is really old

606
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,889
so another few important facts about

607
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:13,080
journalists they're humans too they've

608
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,300
got a job to do and they are overwhelmed

609
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,720
right now security news is moving at a

610
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,480
lightning pace and the noise is also

611
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,010
causing a lot of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stress on the</font>

612
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,280
journalists they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a crank out</font>

613
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:29,210
somewhere between three to five you know

614
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:32,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">28 stories a day and this definitely</font>

615
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:35,010
causes them to have less time to go do

616
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:37,320
really in-depth research and call a

617
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,879
bunch of sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sort of verify the</font>

618
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,340
pieces that they're putting out there

619
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,890
it's just really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the nature</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

620
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting industry these days I'd</font>

621
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,090
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years ago not the case you would</font>

622
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,740
see maybe a one-story a day

623
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,178
from a journalist and you know they go

624
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,580
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a nice dinner and go to bed</font>

625
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:56,010
these guys are up all night I'm seeing

626
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,620
stuff at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 23 am stories breaking on</font>

627
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,860
weekends it is a round-the-clock job

628
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,840
these days and then they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

629
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,209
the low-hanging fruit so they want these

630
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,459
like quick hit stories that you can

631
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,690
package up and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them where you</font>

632
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,610
know you give them a press release

633
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,750
gimmeh threat report sometimes they

634
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,459
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> do interviews because they</font>

635
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,100
just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time so they write them</font>

636
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,070
quickly what they love<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaches</font>

637
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,870
compromises we see a ton of breaches in

638
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,189
fact I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a ton of breach</font>

639
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,199
fatigue out there in the market because

640
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're seeing at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least one to two maybe</font>

641
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,610
three big breaches a day and the news

642
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,409
but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still what the readers</font>

643
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,559
want and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know is going to drive</font>

644
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:36,870
that circulation and they like stories

645
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,000
that cause fear uncertainty and doubt

646
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,908
anything that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause anxiety</font>

647
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,559
or you know be<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye-opening for the</font>

648
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:46,470
reader that's obviously going to be a

649
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:48,120
huge one to gain more readers and they

650
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,549
like news exclusives and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a</font>

651
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,408
lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past few years and as</font>

652
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,510
a PR person who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> pitched news</font>

653
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:57,360
exclusives I know how important it is

654
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:00,149
for a journalist to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a first on</font>

655
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,000
a story we see focus like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Krebs</font>

656
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:04,860
who gets a first on a story and then

657
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,690
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else has to write and it's sort</font>

658
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a game of cat and mouse they've got</font>

659
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,710
to catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to write the story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that just</font>

660
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,570
broke but that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that cycle that</font>

661
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,520
they're in someone breaks it and it's a

662
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,760
catch-up game you know two hours later

663
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,070
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> 250 stories on the same</font>

664
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,169
vulnerability that Brian just broke but

665
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,059
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the nature of how it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

666
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:26,159
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian writes about it it's probably</font>

667
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:29,100
accurate credible it's a story that

668
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,500
everyone else needs to cover and what

669
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,350
reporters don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> love our breaches with</font>

670
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,899
little impact they don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

671
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:39,149
news I told you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> before and right</font>

672
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:41,850
now they are not having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good time with</font>

673
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:44,549
the oversaturation of threat report I

674
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you know even just in the last</font>

675
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:49,620
year year and a half it's become more

676
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,149
difficult for my team to go out there

677
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">with new vulnerabilities and threat</font>

678
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:55,199
reports and actually get them covered

679
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,658
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think reporters are finally</font>

680
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,940
looking at these with raised eyebrows

681
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,110
and wondering about that marketing hype

682
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:07,020
vs real

683
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:08,399
I think reporters are dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

684
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,110
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're dealing with I</font>

685
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,700
don't know how you actually have a job

686
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,350
while you're trying to process all of

687
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,470
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to process but</font>

688
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:20,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know from for us we're seeing you</font>

689
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,929
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> their 1400 and some security</font>

690
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,549
vendors out there and you know ninety

691
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:28,170
percent of them are hitting my email box

692
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:30,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know every day yeah you know asking</font>

693
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,440
for coverage telling us about something

694
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're doing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that kind of</font>

695
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,610
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I don't know how you</font>

696
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,559
begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> process that as a security</font>

697
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,909
professional whether or not you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

698
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,350
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that product whether or not it's</font>

699
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,710
something you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about</font>

700
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,480
using and the threat reports are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

701
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,220
same sort of thing we're we're

702
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,350
constantly filtering we're constantly

703
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:55,140
trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's important</font>

704
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:56,520
and you know the trick is you know there

705
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">are good reporters and there are bad</font>

706
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,809
reporters there are some that are that

707
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:04,410
are good at choosing the right stories

708
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:06,090
to write some are not some are new at it

709
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,860
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just and they just pick up</font>

710
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever is thrown at them first or</font>

711
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:15,299
whatever Krebs was writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that week or</font>

712
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:19,678
whatever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just as you decide</font>

713
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:21,780
who you're going to follow on Twitter

714
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,580
you know among security experts and that

715
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,160
sort of thing it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea to kind</font>

716
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,770
of watch reporters will watch writers

717
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,710
watch people watch publications that you

718
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,080
think are especially good because some

719
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,040
of them are good and some of them are

720
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,299
the other thing too is there a

721
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,340
journalist out there that are

722
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:40,049
freelancers they're waiting for two or

723
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,928
three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> different publications and</font>

724
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:45,059
they are paid by article that is how

725
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:46,830
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making a living so they have to</font>

726
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,720
feed the family so naturally they're

727
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,270
going to try to crank out six seven

728
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,460
eight stories a day and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

729
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have time to you know validate</font>

730
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,840
do a ton of research like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

731
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">just you know it's definitely a very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different environment with journalists</font>

733
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,660

734
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:10,260
and the noise factors in so what else

735
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:13,980
influences the news well vendors and PR

736
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,610
so Tim knows that if he needs a security

737
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,950

738
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,570
he can call me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I represent 12</font>

reporters will<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to people that they</font>

right there at Twitter and that's where

761
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,400
some of the reporters are actually

869
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,630
or too over the top and we have to be

870
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,940
the filter sometimes to say you know

880
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,690
decisions to tell our<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients that's not</font>

00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the end of the day it is about spin</font>

885
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:47,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's our job and you know it's</font>

886
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,770
tough because vendors need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

887
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,570
their own dog food right you know so I

888
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people I you know</font>

889
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:55,100
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and they come in and they have</font>

890
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,770
do an interview and they say we're the

891
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">only ones doing this you know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

892
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,509
sick recalling i can tell you six other

893
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,580
vendors who do the exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing and</font>

894
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:06,860
but they've been living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this little</font>

895
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,840
world where they know what they know and

896
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,990
they have they think they've developed

897
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:15,890
some sort of concept that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand new</font>

898
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:19,279
and so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for both of us we're</font>

899
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:22,220
constantly in a state of in some cases

900
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,420
telling people what the reality is that

901
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,950
we are so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just saw the 15 minute timer</font>

902
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,860
so we're going to probably run through a

903
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,439
few of these pretty quickly just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

904
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,330
sure we get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for wrap up in QA</font>

905
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,640
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some stories get so big well</font>

906
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:40,340
big numbers if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the OPM hack</font>

907
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,750
a year ago I mean everybody had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write</font>

908
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,030
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it continues to drive a lot of</font>

918
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,480
saw at least four hundred stories on

919
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,040

the industry first most dangerous

921
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,520
vulnerabilities horribly drown those are

922

back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attribution we've seen a lot of</font>

927
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,620
that the past few years guess that

928
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,029
information is good it's interesting but

929
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:28,509
at the end of the day if you're at an

<font color="#E5E5E5">happened on Twitter or vulnerability</font>

944
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,150
from the trade pubs and then the

945
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,090
mainstream pubs will pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up and then</font>

946
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:07,630
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tweeting about it and it's</font>

947
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:10,030
you know stories get big because they

948
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:13,600
start out in just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right place at the</font>

949
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:16,090
right time where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know other times a</font>

950
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,270
story might get drowned out I remember

951
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:21,790
of ebay had a had a hack a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

953
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,529
and it but it happened at the same time

954
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,530
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of other things that were</font>

957
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,750
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

958
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,610
nobody else did either and it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

959
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,680
up getting a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of coverage so</font>

960
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:40,930
you know it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be timing there are a</font>

961
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:45,819
lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> factor into you know</font>

962
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:49,149
what you see in the headlines so what's

963
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:51,190
the disconnect well so here we're

964
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking a little bit about just news in</font>

general so your local news they have to

966
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,040
decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're going to pick they</font>

967
00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:01,750

996
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,110
cash you know that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things</font>

997
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,790
where it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know wow that's a</font>

998
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:21,060
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> story but most of you are not</font>

999
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:23,520
managing ATMs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not not as</font>

1000
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,350
useful to you so you know one of the

1001
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,410
things we try to do at dark reading is

1002
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:30,480
we try not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the to focus on the</font>

1003
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,819
shiny objects we try to do more stories

1004
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,740
that are useful to you but you know

1005
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,660
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as subject as everybody else</font>

1006
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,609
you know sometimes you know that drone

1007
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,170
story is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool or the you know the</font>

1008
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,330
car hacking story or you know that kind

1009
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,500
of thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep that in mind as</font>

1010
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,049
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming along some of the things</font>

1011
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are happening may not be in the</font>

1012
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:51,050
news just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know other storage</font>

1013
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,050
got chosen

1014
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:02,750
so here we're talking a little bit about

1015
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:04,070
and and we already you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we talked</font>

1016
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,220
through a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about where the</font>

1017
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:10,520
information comes from but the point

1018
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,069
that I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> making here is that you</font>

1019
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,220
know media<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just one source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

guys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have on you know you're</font>

1021
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">sitting in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle and at the top is</font>

1027
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,799
doing about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you got that push</font>

1028
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,740
then you have users who are finding out

things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're kind of</font>

1033
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,730
pushing up from underneath you have the

know we've discovered this vulnerability

1048
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,529
you need to patch so you've got this so

1049
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,330
and you're saying in the middle and

1050

these places and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're the filter you</font>

1052
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,680
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decide you know today these are</font>

1053
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,990
the most important things that the

1054
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,240
security department has to deal with you

1055
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,850
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it may it may be that that</font>

1056
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,290
boring old patch that has nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1057
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,690
with anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened in the media</font>

1058
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:48,020
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most important thing on</font>

1059
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,520
your on your list you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to decide</font>

1060
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not going to be the same</font>

1061
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,580
for every company that's the other thing

1062
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,810
that drives me crazy about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a</font>

1063
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:59,509
journalist is that I'm sort of spewing

1064
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:01,460
news and but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some of you it</font>

1065
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,040
may not be that important you know if

1066
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,900
you have if it's a new linux threat and

1067
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,279
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any linux then you don't</font>

1068
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,210
care you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though it might be</font>

1071
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,869
of the site you you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter out</font>

1072
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:18,500
what's useful to you you kind of have to

1073
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:20,770
create that that civ that says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1074
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,150
I'm only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care about this and</font>

1075
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:25,670
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though this is interesting and I'll</font>

1076
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,740
read about it when i have a break<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1077
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:30,349
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision</font>

1078
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:38,299
about what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in the security</font>

1079
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:41,780
department<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so and again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1080
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,940
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a you know just a reminder that</font>

1081
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the media doesn't know your environment</font>

1082
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:50,300
so that you know they're they're putting

1083
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:52,460
out stuff and they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get as</font>

1084
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,790
much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know traction as they can in</font>

1085
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:59,390
terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic but they don't they're</font>

1086
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:02,420
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to know you know SI p</font>

1087
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,098
is a great example so if you're you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1088
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:08,210
financial services or lots of other

1089
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:11,570
businesses live breathe sleep SI p your

1090
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:13,820
whole business is SI p but in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

1091
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:16,490
of leadership there are only so many

1092
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,440
people who have SI p there are only so

1093
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,540
many people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

1094
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:24,230
reading about SI p so there may not be

1095
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,150
that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> news there you know so whereas</font>

1096
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,430
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows threat is going to go all</font>

1097
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:31,040
across the web because everybody has

1098
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:33,379
windows so keep that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind as you're</font>

1099
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,450
thinking about it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it depends on</font>

which didn't appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a very many</font>

1105
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,509
publications might actually be the most

1106
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:57,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical thing that day for you to look</font>

1110
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:07,848
you know how corporate executives and

1111
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,070
people you know they see stuff they you

1112
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,180
know it's on 60 minutes it's on it's in

1115
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:18,379
don't know security so you have to be

1116
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to push back and say you know</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that story's not important to us</font>

1118
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:26,400
we got it handled don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1119
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,960
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other cases it might be</font>

1120
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,300
something that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

1121
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,150
answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when your boss says</font>

1122
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,130
you know I saw this today you know it's

1123
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:37,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">just something that we're working on yes</font>

1124
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,930
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on it but its its fifth on</font>

1125
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,910
the priority list because of x y&z you

1126
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:46,348
know so you factor the media in but it's

1127
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:50,190
it's not driving anything I the analogy

1128
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:52,680
I uses in financial services when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1133
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,730
and they only want to hear about pork

1134
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:07,980
bellies and so even though there's tons

1135
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:10,140
and tons of financial news every day and

1136
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,869
they have decisions they have to make on

1137
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,910
a minute-by-minute basis they have a

1138
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:18,510
filter that says only<font color="#E5E5E5"> show me the news</font>

1139
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:20,549
about pork bellies and that's the kind

1140
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:23,490
of thing that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you figure</font>

1141
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:27,119
out where your your most critical data

1142
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:28,890
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's residing on what the what</font>

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,170
the tech what the applications are that

1144
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:33,750
are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and that's how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you read</font>

1145
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:37,290
your news and anything that doesn't fit

1146
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:39,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it aside for reading</font>

1147
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:41,130
it lunch or you know whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1148
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,170
time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to stay up with</font>

1149
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,970
stuff as a security pro so you can have

1150
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,280
conversations or like at conferences

1151
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:49,230
like this but you know the things that

1152
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,940
are important to you as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know from a</font>

1153
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:54,480
on a daily basis maybe something

1154
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:56,010
completely different so what do you do

1155
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,230
if your organization is actually a

1156
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,400
victim of a breach you need to have a

1157
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,040
breach response and crisis

1158
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,900
communications plan in place so there

1159
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of companies out there that do</font>

1160
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,790
tabletop exercises that will bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1161
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:10,680
all of the executives into a room all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1162
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:13,079
the stakeholders that need to be part of

1163
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,509
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually practice you'll role</font>

1164
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:18,510
play you'll prepare for the inevitable

1165
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:20,609
because hopefully none of us will be

1166
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,950
breached but we know the day may come so

1167
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to be prepared from both a</font>

1168
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:27,089
corporate communications and PR

1169
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,369
perspective to you know communicating

1170
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:31,380
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your stakeholders one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> company that</font>

1171
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:33,240
actually did this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well i think is</font>

1172
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,930
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five or six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years now was</font>

bit9<font color="#CCCCCC"> so bit9 is</font>

1174
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,040
security company<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1175
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:41,980
breached and you know when the news

1176
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,859
broke of course it was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of</font>

1177
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,200
headlines but what was great about what

1178
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:50,279
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did is they were very transparent</font>

1179
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:53,109
they wrote about four or five blog post

1180
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,910
disclosing what they knew at what point

1181
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:57,430
in time they knew it and they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1182
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:59,049
honest and I think that's the the one

1183
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,450
thing you know if if I'm a shareholder

1184
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:03,490
in bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine or you know I'm a partner</font>

1185
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,020
customer I want honesty but I want

1186
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,419
communication I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's</font>

1187
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,400
happening but when it comes to the media

1188
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,770
you have to be careful about what you

1189
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,109
say so of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media we're calling</font>

1190
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:16,059
bit9 that day they wanted to know what

1191
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:18,339
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell us the details but at that</font>

1192
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:19,930
moment that that breach happened when

1193
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:22,270
they first figured it out they didn't

1194
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:24,129
have all the details so the advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1195
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:26,800
you know the pr communications team is

1196
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:29,050
you know be honest but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you know if</font>

1197
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,030
you don't have details then don't go out

1198
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,950
right and say you know stuff that's not

1199
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">true or something that you can't back up</font>

1200
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,879
so I thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

1201
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:38,770
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> over communicated but it</font>

1202
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,690
actually in the end didn't really hurt

1203
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:44,349
their brand as much as a normal breach

1204
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:45,549
would you can also turn breach news into

1205
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:47,710
a positive so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

1206
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:53,020
Heartland which was god I don't know

1207
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:54,910
2006 maybe that CEO took that huge

1208
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,710
breach and basically went out there and

1209
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,270
started talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and said here</font>

1210
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,280
are the lessons learned from what we

1211
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,509
went through them what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> experienced so</font>

1212
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,890
you can take something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's negative</font>

1213
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:05,049
and turn it into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive sometimes</font>

1214
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,670
and then I think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to think</font>

1215
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:08,470
about all of the aspects of the

1216
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential impact you know if you are</font>

1217
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,980
breached you have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1218
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,390
investors the brand damage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1219
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the loss of trust and loss</font>

1220
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,440
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> credibility you need to really think</font>

1221
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">about all of these things before it</font>

1222
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,099
actually happens and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1223
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:23,559
do employ and do these tabletop

1224
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:26,049
exercises because that in the end will

1225
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,130
help in that moment where it hits and

1226
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:33,309
you're scrambling and you're trying to

1227
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1228
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:40,270
key takeaways I think you guys know all

1229
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:43,058
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just got the the wrap up in a</font>

1230
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:44,470
nice very nice sign there I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1231
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:46,960
to repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that since my bosses in the</font>

1232
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:48,850
room um

1233
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,670
I think you guys get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

1234
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:53,920

1235
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of factors and use the news to</font>

1236
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,190
your advantage but<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't let it set your</font>
