1
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:29,198
hello everybody so my talk has kind of a

2
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,239
strange title staying above a rising

3
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,070
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> water line through software</font>

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:37,390
engineering so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really sure what</font>

5
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,570
what you guys might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that</font>

6
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:46,750
meant but I kind of think of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as two</font>

7
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:49,300
things one where security is you're

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,489
trying to raise the security bar so get

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,409
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better and better and to</font>

10
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:54,699
where you're constantly getting more and

11
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:59,920
more requirements and things are getting

12
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:11,259
harder and harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> and harder so it's</font>

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:14,170
also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at a high level about how</font>

14
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:16,600
to limit people from making mistakes in

15
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:32,520
your organization software engineering

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:37,508
mistakes and oh and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how I</font>

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,079
focus on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of a lot of what I do is</font>

18
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:44,109
focusing on getting security out of

19
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,029
building high quality software so not

20
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:48,249
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on building security focus on</font>

21
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:52,569
getting security as a byproduct of

22
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:57,908
having really good software and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

23
00:01:52,569 --> 00:02:01,240
important because I work out in San

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:04,119
Francisco a start-up that's growing

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:09,100
really fast so there's constantly new

26
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:14,620
requirements and more and more and more

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:17,549
to do so I work at<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare doing a</font>

28
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,959
lot of various different security things

29
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my fourth time here at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RB a sec</font>

30
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,780
and my first time speaking which is cool

31
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,819
and I'm from from this area so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,450
why I really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come speak at our</font>

33
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,450
be a sec

34
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,790
in the past besides<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare I've</font>

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,828
worked at I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done some independent</font>

36
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,530
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've worked at a last pass</font>

37
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:45,200
which is in fairfax which you some

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:50,849
people might use<font color="#E5E5E5"> which saw it's notable</font>

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so a rising security security</font>

40
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,010
water line at cloud Claire what is

41
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">CloudFlare so we're actually one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

42
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:03,420
biggest networks in the world and this

43
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:06,299
is a the peering exchange lists and we

44
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,119
are we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> peered with more networks</font>

45
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,859
than anyone so well not more than

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,579
anybody hurricane electric meets us but

47
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll beat him soon and we're growing</font>

48
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,470
growing growing this network to be

49
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:22,230
really big we have I think 80 points of

50
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,099
presence around the world in data

51
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,290
centers everywhere and we're processing

52
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:32,280
and what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudflare is is it's a</font>

53
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,709
giant reverse proxy so we sit on the

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,370
network how it works is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it software</font>

55
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,579
as a service<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a website or a web</font>

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,269
service and you change the nameservers

57
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:48,479
to be our name servers and then we sit

58
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,970
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle of all HTTP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requests that</font>

59
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,430
go to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> website we become a trusted</font>

60
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:58,440
man in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that means we</font>

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,440
have massive scale because<font color="#E5E5E5"> our every</font>

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,319
request that all the combination of all

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,269
of our customer sees comes to us first

64
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,879
so we have to handle be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font>

65
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:15,810
all these requests we have a lot of

66
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:19,500
security features of like caching layer

67
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:22,889
waffe firewalls like this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,270
boring stuff that you would expect but

69
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,900
the mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the company is to make</font>

70
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,849
the web faster and more secure and then

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,210
why is security important to us why does

72
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:36,570
this water line matter so we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

73
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,570
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> secrets like I'm sure everybody does</font>

74
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,400
so we give away SSL for free so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

75
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,740
an ssl cert for every one of our

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,320
customers which is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

77
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,600
probably

78
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,159
you really want to keep secret even free

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,550
customers you don't have to pay us

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,050
anything when we give you an ssl cert so

81
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,090
it would kind of be like an end of

82
00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">business end of business day where</font>

83
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,440
everybody just goes home if there's a

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,770
pace bend dump of all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers</font>

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">ssl certificates the the company we've</font>

86
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,990
got our business so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about</font>

87
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,390
security for that reliability so like I

88
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:18,010
said we handle all of our HTTP all of

89
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:20,349
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers HTTP requests so if our</font>

90
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,200
customers an online store<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon's not a</font>

91
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,410
not our customer but they're a good

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,599
example where if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're reliability</font>

93
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,430
matters if this if Amazon's down for a

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,390
minute they know it's a really big deal

95
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's millions of dollars a second so we</font>

96
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:41,469
also do DDoS mitigation and we we

97
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,659
consider our customers real website ip's

98
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,370
secret even though there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

99
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,780
can do to figure it out like if you know

100
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,730
where it's hosted you can narrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down</font>

101
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,729
to a smaller set of IP addresses but we

102
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,830
we know customers IP addresses but we

103
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,350
don't want other people to know our

104
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,240
customers IP addresses so they they

105
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,460
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just circumvent our network by</font>

106
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,300
going right around us and then there's

107
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,340
regular custom customer settings that

108
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,770
are secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> like regular business e</font>

109
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,109
secrets and then internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> secrets we</font>

110
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,950
have an internal certificate authority

111
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,860
and a lot of internal infrastructure

112
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:25,390
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want outsiders to know so</font>

113
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:29,380
security is really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what do</font>

114
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:33,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do here so I kind of got hired and two</font>

115
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:36,490
they said we have a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more</font>

116
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,280
application security for more<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps X</font>

117
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,350
stuff and they said we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

118
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,309
bugs I'm sure why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you go find them</font>

119
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then fix them and we've got hundreds</font>

120
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,610
of code repos to keep you happy and go

121
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:55,930
at it and that isn't what I did at all

122
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,850
because that is a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste of time</font>

123
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,800
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many</font>

124
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">more engineers who know way more about</font>

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,949
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code base so what I'm what I'm going</font>

126
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about here and is more what I do</font>

127
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:15,650
every day is<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day</font>

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:19,400
operation so I spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> time security like</font>

129
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,020
triaging security bugs but then that's

130
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,880
the easy part is making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

131
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,639
don't happen next time and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,139
and what happens if everybody at the

133
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,900
company quits tomorrow and they hire new

134
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,490
people and have the same code base and

135
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:39,489
you still want the security bug to not

136
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:42,889
come back so and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before the</font>

137
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,960
software engineering is this is kind of

138
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:52,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the combination of software engineering</font>

139
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:58,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">and application security so oh that's</font>

140
00:07:52,099 --> 00:08:02,300
not supposed to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so today and</font>

141
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,120
modern software applications modern

142
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,180
software as a service applications

143
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:13,220
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from a monolith which is a</font>

144
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,139
one big poop emoji to micro services

145
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:20,539
which are a lot of much smaller poof

146
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:23,020
emojis distributed poop emojis and this

147
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:26,120
purpose is what things look like today

148
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,659
and it presents new challenges to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

149
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,419
it secure before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had one big thing</font>

150
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:37,510
to protect and now it's things are more

151
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,510
distributed things are better<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font>

152
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,820
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way things are going so</font>

153
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,989
dank there we go

154
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:53,670
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro services are when you split</font>

155
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:57,389
up your services into smaller bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

156
00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:01,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">not actual bits but smaller parts were</font>

157
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:05,499
the parts make up a whole application

158
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:09,550
and it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the goal of micro</font>

159
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:12,370
services is to make the code simpler

160
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,189
which you think would lead to less

161
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,459
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues because you're dealing</font>

162
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:20,469
with simpler code there's fewer problems

163
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:22,869
that can happen if there's not as much

164
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,709
complexity all in one case all in one

165
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">place and it sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like everything</font>

166
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,459
would be great<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become</font>

167
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,910
really difficult to deal with

168
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:36,998
operationally<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if you're not ready</font>

169
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:40,059
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new change which a lot of</font>

170
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:41,939
people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new idea so</font>

171
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:44,980
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still figuring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out and</font>

172
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:51,579
operationally it's a nightmare<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

173
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:53,709
people are doing it all wrong so so from

174
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,888
an application security perspective what

175
00:09:53,709 --> 00:10:00,989
do I do here do i do I review each small

176
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:03,670
part and how do I approach that should I

177
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:07,990
really waste<font color="#E5E5E5"> my time and dive into each</font>

178
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:09,729
separate part separately or how much

179
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:15,519
cohesion is there between all these

180
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:18,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">different micro systems and like I said</font>

181
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,720
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> microservices wrong is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font>

182
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:23,800
and tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are doing it wrong</font>

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,660
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these operational issues</font>

184
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,389
are security issues that we mentioned

185
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier so how do you handle high</font>

186
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:36,399
latency circular dependences

187
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,500
dependencies are you are you equipped to

188
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,209
trace operational issues so if someone

189
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,189
can bring down one of your micro

190
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,138
services and you have other micro

191
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:45,879
services that depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

192
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,759
structure it's a house<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cards and</font>

193
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:53,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything will go down and reliability</font>

194
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:56,680
is key so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're setting yourself</font>

195
00:10:53,379 --> 00:11:00,370
up for failure so security is

196
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,439
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> central and has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

197
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,370
thought of at the very beginning of

198
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,330
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this microservice world and</font>

199
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:18,730
people aren't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that right</font>

200
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:21,370
now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting better so so</font>

201
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:25,480
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudflare we do a micro service</font>

202
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:28,779
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we've done a pretty</font>

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,370
good job accidentally is how it started

204
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,930
but I think we did a really good job so

205
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,300
it makes me<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy it makes the</font>

206
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:41,920
operations people<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy but all of them</font>

207
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:45,399
look the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is key for</font>

208
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,459
security if you're if you're building

209
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">all these things they should all look</font>

210
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:54,399
the same if you're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

211
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are part of a whole it makes</font>

212
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,670
sense so we have a cut like very loosely

213
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,279
these are just a couple requirements all

214
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,560
of our microservices have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> make file</font>

215
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,450
they all have a docker file they're all

216
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,420
written in go and so if someone quits

217
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:17,320
and their part and they worked on one

218
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,020
part of the of the whole anybody can

219
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,690
kind of jump in and be up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed on it</font>

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:26,079
it's kind of the way I think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

221
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:28,870
having a standard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your services</font>

222
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,279
and having a standard for what your

223
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,589
software looks like it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

224
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a style guide line when you're</font>

225
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:36,870
writing style guides with when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

226
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,870
writing code

227
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:51,399
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and never won so what does this mean</font>

228
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">for like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you as a application security</font>

229
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,190
person or you as a information security

230
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:00,959
person when you're dealing with a

231
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:03,430
standard way that services should look

232
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,010
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going to have a lot</font>

233
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,660
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> code reuse because if all of our</font>

234
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:13,240
code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> go we're going to share the same</font>

235
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:15,579
libraries which is good you're going to

236
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,649
have fewer questions to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font>

237
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're looking at each part of this</font>

238
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:26,040
big system it's a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

239
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,040
understand all the ins and outs and

240
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,740
there's going to be fewer burdens to get

241
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,649
started looking at all these different

242
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,570
systems so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone says hey here's a</font>

243
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:46,050
new one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pretty well how to</font>

244
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:48,790
handle tackling this this new system and

245
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:52,300
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward a lot easier so</font>

246
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:55,329
let's say you add a hundred new services

247
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:58,540
to this to this poop emoji cluster

248
00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:01,329
you're you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in pretty good shape</font>

249
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,949
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of have an expectation</font>

250
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:09,430
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like and what that</font>

251
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:13,660
means and it allows you to focus on

252
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,880
what's different about each one so if if

253
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,180
all of your services are Venn diagram

254
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,279
and they all look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this then the</font>

255
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,670
space in the center of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Venn diagram</font>

256
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,980
is pretty big and it just leaves a

257
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit a little bit around the edges</font>

258
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,860
that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at for each</font>

259
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,860
different service

260
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,760
and this is good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

261
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:41,100
operations people just running running

262
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,660
your software business it's good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

263
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and the another thing that I focus</font>

264
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:53,910
on a lot is secure interfaces and secure

265
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,589
interfaces I say up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

266
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,610
designed to help developers make fewer

267
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:06,840
mistakes and this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

268
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:10,140
care a lot about and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the reason</font>

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of this is funny I wrote this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

270
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,390
reason a lot of security companies exist

271
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:18,930
is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people didn't do this and</font>

272
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:24,210
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get two examples of why in just a</font>

273
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:27,290
second but i think that providing secure

274
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:30,270
defaults for code that you write and

275
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,849
libraries and for your developers so

276
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,340
this can be for infrastructure this can

277
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,920
be any for anything secure defaults

278
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,590
really matter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add a</font>

279
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,660
default value it like you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

280
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it to a system whether it's</font>

281
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:51,180
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux how does SSH come pre set up</font>

282
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:56,630
whether it's anything it's all it all

283
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:58,800
really matters in and you should well

284
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,880
interfaces should abstract the way the

285
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,900
difficult parts like not everybody

286
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,110
understands really difficult things

287
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:11,670
about infrastructure and about code and

288
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:13,410
and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same levels of</font>

289
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,839
subject matter expertise that the people

290
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">who built it have so it's it's about</font>

291
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:23,820
like helping the future people who come

292
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:26,970
around and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this handle be able</font>

293
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle it and so like I said a lot of</font>

294
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,380
application or a lot of security

295
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:38,250
companies exist because people didn't do

296
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:40,470
that and here's probably why so<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

297
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,640
does anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is a good secure</font>

298
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:48,030
interface

299
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:51,360
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the string copy and see where</font>

300
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:56,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have you copy a source to a</font>

301
00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:11,760
destination character pointer character

302
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:13,859
array yeah i agree but this is just an

303
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,699
example of is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good interface or</font>

304
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:19,979
not it doesn't have to be whether it's

305
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:25,880
it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't matter</font>

306
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it's at right like this is this is</font>

307
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,130
there's room for improvement and they

308
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,440
tried to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Stern copy and</font>

309
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:39,360
eventually start copy is really good but

310
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,990
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is this is this is like</font>

311
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,699
kind of a classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of a line of</font>

312
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,810
code that can go really horribly wrong

313
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,550
if the source desk if the source is

314
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:55,379
bigger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the destination and storing</font>

315
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:57,629
copy you'll corrupt your memory and this

316
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:03,000
can lead to really bad things and stern

317
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:06,270
copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to well I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

318
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,790
sea history and all this but i imagine

319
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,370
that string stir copy came first in

320
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">store copy stern copy which has this</font>

321
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,250
length so you don't so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can prevent</font>

322
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:21,450
yourself from overrunning your buffer

323
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:24,210
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do better and this is</font>

324
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,120
actually right up that alley of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

325
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:31,050
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who asked the question why don't</font>

326
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,239
you just not manipulate memory well what

327
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">about if you just copy a source and you</font>

328
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,190
get back a pointer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's a lot</font>

329
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">better this is like not good it has</font>

330
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,530
other implications and see this wouldn't

331
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,170
be good code to actually have but it's

332
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,180
kind of abstracting away this this idea

333
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,590
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> manipulating memory yourself and</font>

334
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,280
needing to understand all these details

335
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:59,850
before

336
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:02,340
you use it and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world there</font>

337
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good security secur</font>

339
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:12,540
called an AE ad interface and it's open

340
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,090
in seal and so for years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years and</font>

341
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:19,530
years people have been writing crypto

342
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:25,379
code that is wrong and they get it wrong

343
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:28,889
constantly so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> before there's a</font>

344
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,700
huge barrier to enter to write crypto

345
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:35,880
code you had to someone gives you a

346
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,760
requirement and says encrypt encrypt

347

this string you're going to look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,210
how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I encrypt something let me Google</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably is not secured</font>

353
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,530
probably not good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this went on for</font>

354
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,650
probably 30 or something years where

355
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,990
people people were writing code that

356
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,770
they didn't fully understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

357
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:17,820
crypto code and the problem wasn't that

358
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:20,490
the crypto CODIS the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem wasn't with</font>

359
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:25,439
the requirements the problem was there

360
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:27,960
is no tool to help people help people be

361
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,230
successful at writing this crypto code

362
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,010
and so the a EAD interface came out and

363
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:40,020
it's an attempt to remedy this it it's

364
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:42,320
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the salt library and this is open and</font>

365
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,330
seal so the idea is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> call seal</font>

366
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,520
developer call<font color="#E5E5E5"> seal it encrypts securely</font>

367
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:51,810
a developer calls open it decrypts and

368
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,840
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to understand all the</font>

369
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:58,220
ins and outs of like ciphertext padding

370
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,679
of choosing a block cipher mode of

371
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:05,040
choosing a cipher<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all these</font>

372
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,130
complexities that like that

373
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,909
cryptographers<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about</font>

374
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,950
it's there should just be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an easy way to</font>

375
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:17,180
encrypt and decrypt a securely and

376
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:19,540
that's what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for there's really</font>

377
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">only one issue that still remains with</font>

378
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,610
with it and that's not sorry use if you

379
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,480
reuse if you look you can reuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> this non</font>

380
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:31,699
sporadic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lu in the docs don't do</font>

381
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:38,300
that but they still allow you to shoot

382
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:41,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself in the foot a little bit this</font>

383
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:44,169
is a really big<font color="#E5E5E5"> step forward for for</font>

384
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,370
software development and and

385
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:51,230
cryptography because if this is

386
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,149
successful like more more things will

387
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,300
get secure interfaces and there'll be

388
00:21:53,150 --> 00:22:03,380
less security bugs and less need for

389
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:05,389
people who do application security so

390
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,980
now if you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you ever</font>

391
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:13,580

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:35,770
interfaces and focusing on like how to

instead of just one individual emotion

401
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:51,350
and and this is course so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a bug</font>

402
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:55,430
at work one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> where someone had</font>

403
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:58,899
misconfigured something it's called

404
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">cores cross-origin resource sharing and</font>

405
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:05,090
it's a way to poke a hole in the

406
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">foundation of all web security all web</font>

407
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:12,260
security is based on what's called

408
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">same-origin policy and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coors is used to</font>

409
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,559
poke a tiny hole in that because

410
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,049
sometimes you might want to

411
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:22,549
have two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shouldn't by</font>

412
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:25,340
default be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and you you want</font>

413
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:30,889
them to so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korres is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to do that</font>

414
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:33,860
and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example is I having a page like</font>

415
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:36,320
Google make a request or in this case

416
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,320
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is requesting example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 but</font>

417
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,439
Google shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write code</font>

418
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that makes a request to bank of america</font>

419
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:50,869
and steals all your banking information

420
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:54,169
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> browsers will stop that and Coors</font>

421
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:58,090
Coors allows you to poke that whole of

422
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:58,090
your bank of america to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> google to</font>

423
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,299
and it works with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special special HTTP</font>

424
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,200
headers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're if you're familiar</font>

425
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:19,549
with HTTP this should be fairly simple

426
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:22,580
so the the bug was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kors was really</font>

427
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:26,090
really really misconfigured when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i saw</font>

00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:41,928
really confusing a topic to stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

433
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:44,809
talk about but uh the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer had</font>

434
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:49,749
basically opened a hole where anybody

435
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:49,749
who wanted to could access the website

436
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:54,459
they were poking a hole for anybody and

437
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:06,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that meant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people could the actual</font>

438
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">tak man</font>

439
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:14,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual attack is really complicated</font>

440
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:16,730
of how this is exploited so I if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

441
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,309
if you open this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole for anyone one</font>

442
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:22,100
what happens is you could go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a evil</font>

443
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:27,530
website and the evil website makes a

444
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:32,260
request to bank of america and bank of

445
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,260
america says yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they shouldn't</font>

446
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:50,540
so what i did was i<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote a secure</font>

447
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:56,000
interface around around<font color="#CCCCCC"> this process of</font>

448
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:58,460
picking picking who to allow to talk

449
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,450
your website can talk to who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

450
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:05,540
poke holes for so it's very restricted

451
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:15,530
so so you can't open<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up for anybody</font>

452
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:17,418
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gave this to all the engineers so</font>

453
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,500
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier to maintain so</font>

454
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:23,540
engineers who come come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the future</font>

455
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:27,140
don't need to understand this really

456
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,879
complicated system because Korres by

457
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,669
itself this this cross-origin resource

458
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,860
sharing and poking holes is super

459
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:36,049
complicated there's like four HTTP

460
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,689
response headers that you have to send

461
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:43,610
back and there's all this weird weird

462
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:46,790
oddities that your<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser will do to</font>

463
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,649
see if you're allowed to if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

464
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,690
actual hole that's been poked by Bank of

465
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:56,570
America it gets really really

466
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:58,790
complicated so it can't be expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

467
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,770
everybody understands this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

468
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,820
wrote this security interface around it

469
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:11,900
so it's just a small white list of sites

470
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:15,428
you can poke a hole for and gave it to

471
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">everybody and</font>

472
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:26,340
oh wait and this got me thinking though

473
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:30,899
so my coworker did this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think my</font>

474
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:32,790
coworker is really good engineer and he

475
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,390
just misunderstood this this

476
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:38,610
specification it's an RFC of what

477
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,220
browsers should do for for these for

478
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,350
headers that get handled I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

479
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:47,100
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like a big misunderstanding and</font>

480
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:51,959
it's my other people might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done</font>

481
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:56,939
this so I scanned scanned the Alexa top

482
00:27:51,960 --> 00:28:00,420
million for for this bug and like a

483
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:04,620
thousand work completely completely

484
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:07,530
misconfigured so that anybody could

485
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,810
could bypass<font color="#CCCCCC"> same origin policy this</font>

486
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,720
glue that holds all of web security

487
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:16,260
together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> steel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a proof of</font>

488
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,200
concept and attacked myself and I could

489
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:22,080
steal my I could steal Bitcoin I could

490
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,380
steal credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> information from sites</font>

491
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,960
it to credit cards I could steal all

492
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:34,620
this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scary stuff that you</font>

493
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:38,130
shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal and I think</font>

494
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,199
that goes to show how important security

495
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,510
interfaces are around complexity like

496
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,430
you can't you can't expect everybody to

497
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,660
understand really complex concepts and

498
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:50,990
that's kind of what we do as security

499
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,250
people a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people work in big</font>

500
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:58,530
organizations and smaller organizations

501
00:28:53,250 --> 00:29:00,060
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes there's complexity</font>

502
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,550
that we understand with systems that

503
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:06,000
other people don't and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

504
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:08,220
help to just point at Point a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

505
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,660
and say this has to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed because</font>

506
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,540
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to get repeated and</font>

507
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:15,900
repeated and repeated until the problem

508
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:20,220
is fixed at its core or you or you

509
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">extract away all this complexity from</font>

510
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:30,200
the people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the mistakes and</font>

511
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:33,920
worst is me me finding that all of these

512
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,750
sites are misconfigured if you have any

513
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,430
ideas of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should do because</font>

514
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're still out there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

515
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,360
still really open I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go</font>

516
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,950
hunting down like a thousand email

517
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,929
addresses but like you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get</font>

518
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,430
a CD for it because its people

519
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,520
misunderstanding something and you can't

520
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:52,010
really and it's not one place<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

521
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,970
misconfigured that like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

522
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:57,710
little library that's wrong it's tons

523
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,210
and tons of people misunderstanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

524
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:04,640
and it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> glue of the whole olive web</font>

525
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:20,390
security so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of in a</font>

526
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:23,360
tough spot with it and so so my talk is

527
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:25,690
a little more from the perspective of

528
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,439
software as a service like running a big

529
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:40,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big network or a big software project</font>

530
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:43,400
or keeping things online kind of more a

531
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:47,330
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from what I know a lot</font>

532
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:52,880
of people here do it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no it's a</font>

533
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:54,919
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> different but a lot of times the</font>

534
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,400
coordination in communication and

535
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:01,130
maturity when you approach solving a

536
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,500
problem at its core and not just

537
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:08,450
patching like patches are the worst you

538
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:12,170
you patch something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in n and it's going</font>

539
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be outdated shortly or if you write</font>

540
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,340
some code to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and it's not</font>

541
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna and someone else will repeat the</font>

542
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:22,490
same bug over and over again like these

543
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,710
unless you solve security issues at

544
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:29,540
their very core then they just get

545
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:32,980
repeated or they or they just continue

546
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,980
on or manifest themselves elsewhere

547
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:42,690
and and since I said this is kind of

548
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:48,000
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the combination</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of software</font>

549
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:52,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering meets meets security I work</font>

550
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,910
with software engineers so a lot of

551
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,770
times what helps me is what helps them

552
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,080
as well so if they're running into the

553
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:01,440
same problem tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tons of times I</font>

554
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,540
can help them by making them more secure

555
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,390
and abstracting away complex things and

556
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,700
make their life easier to<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy buy them</font>

557
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:12,030
not having to worry about about this

558
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,010
stuff all this security business they

559
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,570
don't care they just want they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

560
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do their job they have requirements</font>

561
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:21,679
and it helps everybody all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

562
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys</font>
