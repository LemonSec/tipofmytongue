00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,619
well I know we're coming up right on two

2
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">o'clock so i think we might go ahead and</font>

3
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,329
get started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our session on show me</font>

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,980
the money how much does a breach

5
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:37,180
actually cost us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be messing</font>

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this mike throughout the entire</font>

00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,949
presentation um my name is Inga godine

8
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,530
I'm with risk-based security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where I</font>

9
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:49,659
head up our data breach research efforts

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,239
so what we do is we look at a lot of

11
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:54,070
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of breach events</font>

12
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,629
quantify those events and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalog</font>

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,239
those events and then look at the impact

14
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:59,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fallout</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from those events and so</font>

15
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,379
understanding the cost of a breach is

16
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:04,000
very near and dear to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my heart i'm also</font>

17
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:05,890
very near and dear to the hearts of i

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">think many other folks here in the room</font>

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,240
as well I'm and it is certainly become

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,080
the quintessential million-dollar

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,610
question and although I think it can be

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit of a challenging question to</font>

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,170
answer i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's stuff definitely a</font>

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,700
topic worth talking about and I know

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,400
it's a topic that's near and dear to my

I'm the managing director for

miscellaneous professional liability but

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,929
also our cyber insurance product so it's

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,140
definitely it's definitely near and dear

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my heart to actually figure out what</font>

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,979
does it cost it does because she has to

36
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,650
write the check at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day</font>

37

and are you gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me the answer by</font>

00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:58,180
the end of this no honesty right that's

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it's all about and so what we</font>

40
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,320
thought we would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> today it's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,869

<font color="#E5E5E5">what sort of resources are available to</font>

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:09,008
us right now for answering this breach

cost question what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we find when we</font>

45
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,429
go out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look for for answers</font>

46
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">and talk a little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

pros and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons of each one of those</font>

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,280
sources and really identify what we can

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
trust versus what is a little bit of

50
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,420
smoke and mirrors I'm we are going to

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,298
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of time talking about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

can tackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> this question for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves</font>

53
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:28,269
because I would argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

54
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,000
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good methodologies out there that</font>

55
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,349
we can use for calculating the impact of

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,210
a breach and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

57
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more meaningful</font>

58
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,390
when we take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the perspective</font>

59
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,369
of what it means to our specific

60
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,660
organization and the cost structures

61
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,970
associated with our specific

62
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,500
organizations and from there we'll talk

63
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,660
a little bit about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wild-card</font>

64
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">factors that I think really play into</font>

65
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,380
what the ultimate cost of an event might

66
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,510
look like I'm so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I felt like I</font>

67
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,460
needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest I'm at the opening</font>

68
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this session and share with everybody</font>

69
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,560
that when Becky and I first started

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,300
working together on breach cost issues

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
and we were first putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> together cyber</font>

72
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,050
insurance policies and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,340
that our actuaries were asking us well

74
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,230
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this actually going to cost</font>

75
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,370
us at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day you know are we</font>

76
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,560
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much are we going to have</font>

77
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually write a check for and we</font>

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,950
started doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and our due</font>

79
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,990
diligence and quickly realized we don't

80
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,000
know we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer to that</font>

81
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">question but we know we want to do this</font>

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,560
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and dive in and</font>

83
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,790
see where the chips fall and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,350
that's a hard conversation with

85
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,200
actuaries because they like that you

86
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,210
know there's that set that data set that

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,890
they they can work off of and they know

88
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,390
and that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> insurance is based on</font>

89
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:41,260
and they didn't have that so it became

90
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:43,000
your guests are their guests absolutely

91
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,519
and we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey we can guess right um</font>

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,430
but as we work through these issues and

93
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,780
we as we have investigated the issue of

94
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,000
reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs a little bit more closely</font>

95
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,840
just guessing it really doesn't cut it

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,730
I'm it just simply doesn't work and I've

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,190
come to the conclusion that there really

98
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of good reasons why we do need</font>

99
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,810
to investigate what is the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

100
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,220
breach to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization and certainly</font>

101
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,500
first and foremost is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

102
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,120
can calculate these numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously we</font>

103
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,400
can start to justify our spend on

104
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,990
security right and because we can show

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the folks that are making the</font>

106
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,530
decisions about where we're going to

107
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend our money and how we're going to</font>

108
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:22,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend our money that look you know if we</font>

109
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">can calculate this impact and we can see</font>

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the number is going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

111
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,000
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day don't we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

112
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,090
investing in our security<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to</font>

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,980
prevent this ultimate outcome and I

114
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">think even more so than just putting the</font>

115
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,570
numbers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the page I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

116
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,610
that when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to management and</font>

117
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,250
business leaders the terminology that

118
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,910
they really understand the impact that

119
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,680
they can relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> most easily is</font>

120
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,509
dollars and cents

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,310
how much am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to write</font>

122
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,199
that check for at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

123
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,270
that that's the terminology that they

124
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,240
understand I mean low medium and high

125
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,859
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps when we're doing impact</font>

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,870
assessments right but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

127
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually put a lot of weight behind it</font>

128
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,770
and it doesn't actually convince folks

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,460
why we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be investing in our</font>

130
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,380
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> processes in our technology so</font>

131
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,060
with that we turn to what sort of

132
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,100
resources are available to us out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

133
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now to understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs and</font>

134
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,090
certainly top on the list is the PO

135
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,080
naman<font color="#E5E5E5"> Institute how many folks have</font>

139
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,109

141
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,070
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at anyone i mean i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

143
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,419
everyone realizes that there is there's

144
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,550
a need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these this analysis and some</font>

145
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,830
cost analysis but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to understand</font>

146
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,449
whenever you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at any one of</font>

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,310
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> reports whoever it's coming out of</font>

148
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,080
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand where is that</font>

149
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,300
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from what is that</font>

150
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,419
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just to kind of give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

151
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,949
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of insight on pony mom is you</font>

152
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,109
know it's 350 companies that were

153
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,599
surveyed and it's not just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

154
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were 11 countries involved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

155
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">in different countries is different so</font>

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,520
you know it what that dollar amount says

157
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,289
to you know me who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Illinois</font>

158
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,240
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different than someone</font>

159
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,680
sitting in another country so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,500
to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're when</font>

161
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,430
you're looking at these and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

162
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,229
look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the average cost 3.7</font>

163
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,699
million dollars the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average cost per</font>

164
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,219
record is a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fifty four</font>

165
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,380
dollars so that's what does that mean

166
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,300
what is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> record you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to</font>

167
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,620
everybody everybody's record is it's a

168
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit different there's a different</font>

169
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:44,320
value on everybody's data you know so it

170
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:47,199
is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most widely quoted numbers</font>

171
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,930
yes and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all kind</font>

172
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> go why is everyone using that number</font>

173
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,389
you know it's just it's not exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

174
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want that to be because it is just a</font>

175
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:00,940
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited set of data and it's</font>

176
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,390
limited but it's very expansive so it's

177
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,100
kind of like

178
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,740
how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are you getting 154 and</font>

179
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,340
how is that the exact number yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

180
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,580
know and is it just data breaches that

181
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're there they're just is that the</font>

182
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,390
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that you're going to be</font>

183
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,510
impacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by probably why not there's</font>

184
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably a lot of other security events</font>

185
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,740
so that's I mean with with this it's

186
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:27,190
it's really understanding that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

187
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">just it's it's quite it's a limited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

188
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,300
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 countries is that what</font>

189
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,340
you're looking is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what your company</font>

190
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,990
does it is it affected by all those

191
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,270
countries as well so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a</font>

192
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,940
closer number to you maybe it's not is

193
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,729
that is that fluff is there any fluff in

194
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,740
there yes yes sir and really<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end</font>

195
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day is records really a good</font>

196
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,120
calculation point right should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

197
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,359
be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of records</font>

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,710
impacted in order to calculate<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost it's</font>

199
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,080
a nice and easy shorthand to use and

200
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,359
managers seem to love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but what</font>

201
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,280
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those incidents that impact a</font>

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,960
limited number of records but take an

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,659
extraordinary amount of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

204
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,030
remediate or it has an incredible

205
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,820
disruption on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business processes</font>

206
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,010
how can you equate records number two

207
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,810
what that impact is and at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

208
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day I think calculating by record</font>

209
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,040
number is it's not going to give you

210
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,050
anything meaningful it's not going to

211
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,360
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole story so others have</font>

212
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,110
tried some different approaches so net

213
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,850
diligence this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information comes from</font>

214
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,470
insurance carriers so you know there's

215
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,150
the net diligence has a lot of

216
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,130
relationships with<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance carriers</font>

217
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,350
and they you know they reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

218
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,320
every year and say hey give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us your data</font>

219
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:44,440
and that's the information they take and

220
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,090
part of the the dollars associated with

221
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,280
that that you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to keep in</font>

222
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,530
mind is the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's given to</font>

223
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,520
net diligence from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriers is what</font>

224
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,810
did we pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> out so that payment is only</font>

225
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,290
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was covered by their insurance</font>

226
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,239
policy that doesn't really encompass

227
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,160
everything that may have been spent out

228
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,350
there may even be things that you know

229
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,969
depending on who that<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier is there</font>

230
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,280
were different exclusions and different

231
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,460
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were being covered so even</font>

232
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,800
within that data set it's not apples to

233
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,529
apples so it's it's a it's a

234
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,380
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go by you know and if you</font>

235
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,600
look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the their median cost</font>

236
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,880
here of thirteen dollars they have a

237
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,470
range of typical range of payouts thirty

238
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,570
thousand dollars to two hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

239
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,690
sixty three thousand dollars it's quite

240
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:35,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">a range you know an average cost per</font>

241
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,300
records 964 dollars a little different

242
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,229
from the last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saw 154 dollars</font>

243
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,219
that we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really believe that</font>

244
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,829
either so where is that 964 coming from

245
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,399
it's that very small subset of what's

246
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:50,229
being paid and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's it's only</font>

247
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,420
companies that have insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

248
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,440
know so is their mindset different than

249
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,829
a company that doesn't have insurance

250
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,560
maybe maybe not it is across multiple

251
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:03,399
industries so there's a lot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot here</font>

252
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:09,040
with a little subset oh what a lot of a

253
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:11,890
little a lot of alone but you know the

254
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,959
verizon estimate using supposedly the

255
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:19,510
same data is 58 cents a record so what

256
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,040
made that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost so different based on</font>

257
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,010
those those two what were they looking

258
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,829
at come up with such different numbers

259
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,839
and if you apply yeah so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it</font>

260
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really have to understand</font>

261
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the other you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a breach of</font>

262
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,510
a thousand records<font color="#E5E5E5"> could cost anywhere</font>

263
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:38,350
from three thousand dollars to 1.4

264
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,060
million dollars not helpful oh it

265
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,829
doesn't narrow it does that do for you

266
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,279
how does that help you estimate your

267
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:48,130
costs not so good I'm not sure does I'm

268
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,540
not so sure it does either and there are

269
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,950
a few other approaches out there that I

270
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,319
think are definitely worth mentioning

271
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,970
real quickly I'm in early on there was a

272
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,040
lot of academic research that came out

273
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,250
around actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the impact to</font>

274
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,279
share price I'm and can we see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

275
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,279
holistic impact or a broader impact to

276
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,899
the organization as a reflection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

277
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,660
investors thought that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

278
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,649
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the business and some of</font>

279
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,060
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're kind of nice about</font>

280
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,070
it is it certainly is evidence-based

281
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,589
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at a very specific set</font>

282
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,360
of outcomes can we point to yes this

283
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,970
breach happened here's what happened to

284
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,740
the share price the next day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

285
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,449
also capture a lot of that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all</font>

286
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,040
that informations public which is

287
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:28,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">another nice thing because you know</font>

288
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
folks don't really like to show

289
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,650
or this type of information so you can

290
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,510
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there and actually look for for</font>

291
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,980
the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it without actually</font>

292
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,470
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince folks to give you the</font>

293
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,630
information as well I'm but what some of

294
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,980
these studies have shown and what some

295
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,130
of this academic<font color="#E5E5E5"> work has shown is</font>

296
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,390
really a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very mixed outcomes and I think</font>

297
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,450
they're mixed outcomes for a number of

298
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,220
reasons I mean one is I think big among

299
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,320
them is is you're really looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

300
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,240
impact of publicly disclosed events

301
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,940
right so you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the</font>

302
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,730
impact of the worst of the worst but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

303
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,080
think we've also seen as time goes on

304
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,900
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of investors simply have</font>

305
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,210
breach fatigue right they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

306
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,400
know what it's going to mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

307
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,780
bottom line of an organization they hear

308
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">about these events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening all the</font>

309
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,959
time and as outsiders looking in do we

310
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,390
really have a way to materially estimate

311
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,550
what that means to the organization and

312
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the answer's no that</font>

313
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,510
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type of detail so</font>

314
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,420
investors can't make that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

315
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,980
rational economic decision about what

316
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,620
does it mean to the share price of the

317
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,750
organization so that's not a very good

318
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,120
measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of breach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of breach impact</font>

319
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,100
either now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some other tools</font>

320
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,680
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there and available to us</font>

321
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,480
and if you just google data breach cost

322
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,750
calculator and you'll find a litany of

323
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,570
them most of them are free online tools

324
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:53,230
um and while some of those can be fun to

325
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,900
play with for a little bit I'm everybody

326
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,390
has heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> the saying right the value of</font>

327
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,209
free is exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pay for it and</font>

328
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think what's that yeah so what's that</font>

329
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,800
worth I'm a lot of the free tools that

330
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,230
are out there are simply too generalized

331
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,689
and don't give us enough specificity to

332
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,780
really be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to impact or to really be</font>

333
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,820
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to calculate impact if you want to</font>

334
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,069
go into total opposite direction there

335
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,530
are some nice tools out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

336
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,100
for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing impact assessment and cost</font>

337
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:26,140
impact assessments but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are very</font>

338
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,270
high-priced subscription services and

339
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,920
when we think about our limited budgets

340
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,860
and how much we have actually available

341
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,670
to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on security it can be difficult</font>

342
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to justify investing in a tool that's</font>

343
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,170
really a one-trick pony<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might not</font>

344
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually help us out more at the end of</font>

345
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,060
the day too

346
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,670
we be more secure be a little bit better

347
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,410
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> every corporation is very</font>

348
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,360
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their spend and where it</font>

349
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,250
should go and what's the right spend and

350
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,290
that might not always to every

351
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,830
corporation seemed like the best use of

352
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,899
their money absolutely not um but it

353
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,690
does i think beg the question of why is

354
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:06,080
this so hard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to get our hands</font>

355
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,580
around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the biggest</font>

356
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,350
challenges that we struggle<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

357
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">every company is a little bit different</font>

358
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,450
every company<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a different cost</font>

359
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:17,149
structure if you think about it I'm what

360
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,800
we what we ultimately spend will depend

361
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">on things like one of our relationships</font>

362
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,870
with our vendors the skills of our

363
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,580
incident response team and are we

364
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,890
actually handling the incident response

365
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,930
in-house are we shifting it out out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

366
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,720
house so different companies have

367
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,209
different cost structures and that makes

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,610
equating apples to apples to apples very

369
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:40,550
difficult how do you rationalize that or

370
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,839
normalize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another one of</font>

371
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,819
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> big barriers that we have right now</font>

372
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that not a lot of companies like to</font>

373
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,600
share this information I'm certainly as

374
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,430
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about in this</font>

375
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,959
morning's keynote address there are a

376
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,609
lot of challenges with just getting

377
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,310
organizations to share threat

378
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,500
intelligence try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to open up</font>

379
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,300
and share about money is a little bit

380
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,650
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up to somebody and saying hey</font>

381
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,250
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much money did you make last year</font>

382
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:07,130
I'm nobody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share that</font>

383
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,860
information I'm it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

384
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,080
like the corporate secret of the year

385
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,910
and it's interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because as you know</font>

386
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,709
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the insurance side and you</font>

387
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,300
know we're asking for information on an

388
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,979
application essentially we don't

389
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily always have the opportunity</font>

390
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the company's we're looking</font>

391
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,970
to ensure but you know it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

392
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,000
confidential document that has some of

393
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,650
this information but they're very very

394
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,839
tight with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information and and</font>

395
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't even want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share it which</font>

396
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,040
makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for us even assess</font>

397
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,349
what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're what is there yeah how</font>

398
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,969
much are they paying right absolutely

399
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I think there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of other</font>

400
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,279
challenges as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well when we think about</font>

401
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,420
overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to the organization and I</font>

402
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think one of the bigger ones that we</font>

403
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,050
face is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to tend to become</font>

404
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,719
absorbed over time into normal

405
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,430
operations right and when we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

406
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,350
being especially true in cases

407
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,329
or maybe there's been a compromise of

408
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,710
health information<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's triggered an</font>

409
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,350
investigation by<font color="#E5E5E5"> health and human</font>

410

services they come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a consent</font>

411
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,330
order that says well for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next three</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">years five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years or sometimes even 20</font>

do x y&z to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> your security well x</font>

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">y&z will simply become just a part of</font>

416
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,240
normal operations right so is that

417
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">really do you calculate that is a part</font>

418
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,930
of a breach impact or no and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one of the challenges that we</font>

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,029
trying to quantify brand damage or

422
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,610
damage to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our trade secrets and it is I</font>

423
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,240
think one of the more difficult and

424
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,399
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the much more</font>

425
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,440
subjective things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also one of the</font>

426
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,320
topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much at</font>

427
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,560
the top of management's list of things

428
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,870
to understand when we do have this type

429
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,449
of incident what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean to us as</font>

430
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,580
far as our brand and we do see and we'll

431
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little bit later about how</font>

432
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,110
organizations have a tendency to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

433
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,180
above and beyond what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might normally</font>

434
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,400
expect them to do in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

435
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect that brand at the end of the day</font>

436
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,949
it's a big contributor to the ultimate

437
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:12,260
cost but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately I think the reason</font>

438
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,300
why we really struggle with this is that

439
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we simply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a meaningful</font>

440
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:22,129
methodology or framework for calculating

441
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,980
impact we look at certain specific cost

442
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,230
points but I would argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

443
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a step back and actually think</font>

444
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:33,440
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what sort of</font>

445
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,860
impact has this particular event had on

446
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,230
our organization and can we identify

447
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:42,830
specific impact points and equate that

448
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,380
to a cost and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think actually the</font>

449
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer is yes we can do that and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

450
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,190
to give a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat tip out there to a group</font>

451
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,620
of folks who did some work in the space

452
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:56,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">and 2013 I'm a gentleman by the name of</font>

453

Russell Thomas I'm with a group of other

454
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:00,740
folks who put together the study how bad

455
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,690
is it a branching activity model to

456
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,669
estimate impact of information security

457
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,140
breaches and if you have a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

458
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,580
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out their paper it's really</font>

459
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">worthwhile because I think they have</font>

460
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,639
some fancy

461
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,279
stick ideas for how we can go about

462
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:14,840
tackling this problem and it really

463
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,850
helped me call us some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my thinking</font>

464
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,980
around how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand impact and</font>

465
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,590
essentially what they argue for is that

466
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">anytime we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> event that incurs</font>

467
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:29,689
some sort of action outside of our

468
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,330
normal incident response that we can see

469
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,399
that there has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an indicator of an</font>

470
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,960
impact taking place and it's taking

471
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:38,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">place in the course of the cost of</font>

472
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,700
recovery or restoration to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

473
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,679
and while their study was really looking

474
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,799
at building out a much larger framework

475
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:49,009
that we all can use and to do some

476
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:50,450
generalized estimation I think there are

477
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">some really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neat things that we can pull</font>

478
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,429
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their out of</font>

479
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">their study that we can use to build our</font>

480
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:00,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">own type of model and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think when we do</font>

481
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,460
build that own model then we get too

482
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:04,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">much more specifics where we're using</font>

483
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,429
cost estimates that are germane to our

484
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:10,070
specific organization we can also tie it

485
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:12,230
back to observable identifiable events

486
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,210
so that when we're talking to management

487
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,649
we can go to them and say hey yes we

488
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,210
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a cost or an impact</font>

489
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:19,488
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because we can see</font>

490
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it lets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this experiment with some</font>

491
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:24,590
different scenarios map to transfer

492
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,840
options like insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually I</font>

493
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">think helps us broaden our conversation</font>

494
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,899
from not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just how much will this cost us</font>

495
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,658
to what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the larger impact</font>

496
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:38,389
to our business as a whole in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

497
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:40,999
recover so getting a little more

498
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:43,939
granular with that so what exactly is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

499
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:46,580
impact point how do we how do we find or

500
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,139
look for an impact point and i would say

501
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,629
once we start to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these</font>

502
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:53,779
particular pieces they start to become

503
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:55,879
relatively clear i'm from the study and

504
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:58,399
they define an indicator of impact as

505
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:00,820
being an observable event behavior

506
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:03,619
action change or communication

507
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,590
indicating an attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to respond recover</font>

508
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:10,158
restore rebuild reposition as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result</font>

509
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,749
of harm and i love that definition to be

510
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfectly honest with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you because that</font>

511
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:15,919
encompasses not only what we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

512
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">as an extraordinary expense but also</font>

513
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,570
encompasses the time that we might spend

514
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,710
and responding the extraordinary time we

515
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,590
might spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

516
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a particular event and when you start</font>

517
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,939
to break that down I think you can break

518
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">it down into response like cleanup</font>

519
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,549
replacement costs those type of expenses

520
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,549
and you can break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down into a</font>

521
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:40,010
diversion you you diverted people's time

522
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,500
maybe you diverted resources and you can

523
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,789
also break it down into very specific

524
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:47,929
consequences such as legal fees fines

525
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:49,370
penalties and that sort of thing so I

526
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:52,130
know that's kind of high level but sort

527
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,570
of taking this down a notch or two how

528
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,279
would this actually work if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

529
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build our own tool for</font>

530
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,970
estimating costs to our particular

531
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,039
organization how can we put this to work

532
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,080
well I think what we get to do is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

533
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,789
to be creative right we can pull out of

534
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">our history we can look at some</font>

535
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,690
incidents that we've experienced in the

536
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,100
past or<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get creative and develop</font>

537
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,630
our own unique scenario that we're

538
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,908
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what the cost is</font>

539
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,649
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so we can develop what that</font>

540
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,990
scenario is going to look like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

541
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:20,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">can start to map out very specific</font>

542
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,299
indicators of impact to the organization

543
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:25,250
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and see yes this is an</font>

544
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,110
observable event this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what happened</font>

545
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,200
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start to track those</font>

546
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,000
indicators of impact we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also</font>

547
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,520
establish pretty straightforward

548
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,200
methodologies for calculating what that

549
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,289
impact might be whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in terms of</font>

550
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,000
hours resources whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> and whatever is</font>

551
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:44,750
germane to our particular organization

552
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,330
then as our scenario unfolds we can pick

553
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,760
out each one of those impact points we

554
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,918
can tally the cost at the end of the day

555
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,000
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us our</font>

556
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,340
estimation of cost so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,620
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what those impact</font>

558
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,270
what those indicators of impact looked

559
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,879
like and what is an indicator of impact

560
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,158
so here we've kind of separated this out

561
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,440
into a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different categories your</font>

562
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,390
response and recovery so your time how

563
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,159
much time<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take you and you</font>

564
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,830

fraud or is there damage to some assets

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,049
there what's the cost associated with

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:50,179
something that we're all hearing a lot

00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:51,500
about now in the news clean and repair

606
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,000
the assets do you need to clean the

607
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,429
repair the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assets or do you need to</font>

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">replace the assets and recover from that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of those those impacts a side impacts</font>

611
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,149
absolutely but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even take it a</font>

612
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,740
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> further I'm you can start to</font>

613
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:09,739
quantify things like business

614
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,779
interruption we had downtime right or

615
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,690
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we incurred some contractual</font>

617
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:21,470
maybe even delays or cancellations lost

618
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,899
sales lost sales are very calculable

619
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:27,380
when we can say clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there was an</font>

620
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:28,969
event did it result in some sort of some

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,880
sort of business interruption as far as

622
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:35,149
sales or income coming in or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even an</font>

623
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,889
ultimate a bad case scenario did we

624
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:38,750
realize as a result of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> event that</font>

625
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:41,510
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change up our vendors or that</font>

626
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:44,149
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be rethinking maybe even our</font>

627
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,799
staff unfortunately I'm when we think

628
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,629
about any time there's a staff change

629
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,309
anytime there's a vendor change that's

630
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:51,408
an impact to the organization

631
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:54,110
and it's an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

632
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:57,740
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> being spent to making that</font>

633
00:24:54,110 --> 00:25:00,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">change and those those types of changes</font>

634
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,009
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered as a part of our</font>

635
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:05,870
total breach<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs and then likewise</font>

636
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:07,220
with some extraordinary expenses and

637
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,928
these are the things that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

638
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,299
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a wild card that can come into</font>

639
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:12,919
play after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact and they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

640
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,570
be things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the cost of outside legal</font>

641
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,100
counsel maybe you have to bring in

642
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,999
somebody to help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what</font>

643
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,279
some statutory requirements might be

644
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:24,169
there may be additional audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs or</font>

645
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,509
compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs or cost of deferred</font>

646
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:28,909
cost of upgrade actually or even fines

647
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:31,519
or penalties but the point here really

648
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:34,100
is that when you start to look for these

649
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,980
indicators of impact you can see them

650
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,748
rather clearly they're out there it's

651
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,779
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're not necessarily looking</font>

652
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:45,139
for them right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we look for</font>

653
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:47,179
them we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> set them down on paper or</font>

654
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:49,369
somewhere else I'm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can start</font>

655
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,110
to measure them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would also argue</font>

656
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:53,509
that we can measure them in very

657
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,850
specific ways we can measure them in

658
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:58,669
terms of hours spent outside of the

659
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,559
ordinary incident response we can

660
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:03,470
measure in terms of resources being

661
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,090
diverted I'm taken off task and put

662
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,100
towards something new or something

663
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,350
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is an impact to the</font>

664
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,149
company and likewise all of those

665
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:15,498
unexpected expenses they're pretty

666
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:18,768
obvious what those might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be um but all</font>

667
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:21,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these elements go into what did my</font>

00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:32,360
we just a real life example no names<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

672
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:34,219
you know we hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensured that they had</font>

673
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,350
an incident they went in they hired a

674
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,110
vendor it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party forensic</font>

675
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:42,850
vendor to come in fix fix fix their

676
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:46,279
problems find and fix my technical terms

677
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,649
and they came in they fixed it it was

678
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:52,360
ecommerce<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was it a lot of it had</font>

679
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:54,590
you know pci implement implications<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

680
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,758
you know thought they fixed it they got

681
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,980
in there they started doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

682
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,850
again come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out it wasn't fixed</font>

683
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,260
so those fines and penalties that you

684
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,669
thought you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you had that cap</font>

685
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,590
fine you thought you brought in the

686
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,570
right vendor now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and</font>

687
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,459
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reduce some of those expenses so</font>

688
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,639
that's that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those you know all</font>

689
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">along cascading impact but that is I</font>

690
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things about</font>

691
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">creating some of these own scenarios</font>

692
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,660
right so folks are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask well if</font>

693
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,720
we spent money here would it have

694
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,370
prevented this ongoing attack if we had

695
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,380
done a better job of vetting the vendor

696
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,360
up front if we had established<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

697
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,700
relationship with a vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

698
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,379
have helped us out beforehand instead of

699
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,860
just pulling out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow pages to say</font>

700
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:42,080
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can answer the phone those are</font>

701
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,209
the drivers right and that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

702
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,120
by looking at indicators of impact when

703
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:50,780
we map these events we can start to see

704
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,639
where those factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that drive up</font>

705
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,620
the cost and certainly not having

706
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,400
established relationships when you know

711
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,480
i know i said you can calculate all of

712
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,330
this and i would say you absolutely can

713
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,850
calculate all of this and we all when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

reach out to our fellow colleagues and

within our organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would wager</font>

00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can come up with some pretty</font>

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,540
start to equate a cost associated with

728
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,840
some overhead information or some cost

730
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,580
break it down to what is that hourly

likewise with outside counsel you need

737
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:13,189
to go outside and hire somebody to help

738
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:15,260
out with the response<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you you can</font>

get their hourly rates and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would argue</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go and talk to the general</font>

on this response how much do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that would cost they can probably give</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an estimate of what those hours are</font>

747
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,680
and we can start to play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

748
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,170
modeling some different scenarios while

all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need 28 hours maybe</font>

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,430
we need 50 hours what if it's a really

worst-case scenario and we need a

752

hundred or two hundred hours or even two

754
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,680
drag on you can start to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the math and</font>

755
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">play out what those different scenarios</font>

764
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,550
the cost of an interruption or a delay

the quality quantity of goods you would

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,780
have produced I'm times the value of

769
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,429
each unit and again if you reach out to

770
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,260
the folks in the accounting side and say

771
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,930
hey you know how much do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

772
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,990
would cost us in terms of sales if our

during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> busiest time of the weekend</font>

775
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,620
and they know those numbers numbers

776
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,719
they're not they're not pulling those

777
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,820
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air they when it comes down</font>

well or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help out you know</font>

communication systems were down and

796
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,830
there was potentially some

797
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,110
anecdotal evidence at least in the news

798
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,600
reports that the systems were kinky and

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,540
but they did ultimately decide that

we've got a big problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on here</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually forced the hospital to revert</font>

to paper records for their patients they

808
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,840
were actually writing down what was the

811
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,470

813
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,460
and because they felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like even though</font>

814
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,070
that there was no impact to patient care

815
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,380
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular moment and they</font>

weren't sure where it was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so</font>

817
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,460
they weren't accepting patients um and

818
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:23,190
then ultimately sometime over the

weekend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CEO decided that the most</font>

821
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,790
track was actually to pay the forty

dollars of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty Bitcoin are about</font>

823
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:36,090
the seventeen thousand dollars to get

824
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,980
their systems restored to them and by

00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monday the system was back their</font>

now this is what we know from from the

828
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,030
outside right from just what we can

829

glean from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reports but you</font>

830
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:53,490
start to map out those indicators of

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:55,380
impact points for this particular event

832
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,380
and it can look something like this

833
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">lovely flow diagram</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um by the fifth</font>

834
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,180
right they had the malware detected they

835
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,500
what did they do what was the immediate

836
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,750
impact will they took the systems

837
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,430
offline right and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the result of</font>

838
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,930
that while we know actually from the new

00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,420
stories as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that they brought in</font>

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,670
some outside assistance to help them get

to have to convert that record over or

846

back into an electronic medical record

847

what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what's the impact to</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization as patients being</font>

850
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,870
diverted while they lost out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on revenue</font>

851
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,030
from the from those folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were that</font>

852
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,070
went somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else we also know they</font>

853
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,710
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up a call center inside the</font>

854
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,939
hospital itself to help answer questions

855
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,230
because patients were calling it people

856
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,190
were calling in are you open for

857
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,620
business what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

858
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,850
going on you know how are you taking

00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">care of your patients that are in there</font>

860
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,408
right now so they had to divert

861
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:53,909
resources staff resources to answer

862
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:56,909
those calls and to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

863
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:59,759
public ultimately they paid the 17,000

864
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,019
to get their systems back but then in

865
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,549
the course of doing that they also

866
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,759
decided we need to coordinate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

867
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:08,250
FBI right so they're reaching out and in

00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,079
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a coordinated investigation</font>

spent his entire weekend talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

there may also be some extra expense

absolutely absolutely and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> map how it</font>

the day right so additional time you've

888
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,429
got your staff hours and maybe you have

889
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">a can equate that to a cost per hour if</font>

890
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">not at least you know the staff hours</font>

response by the fifth when they declared

00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,329
a state of emergency now you've got

894
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">something outside of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ordinary same</font>

899
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,670
Hollywood Presbyterian or how much they

900
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,400
actually paid for some of these

901
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,730
additional services<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just based on my</font>

903
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,260
the 17,000 was actually the one of the

smallest pieces of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cost the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">organization I'm if you look at all the</font>

906
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:32,790
time and all the resources and just on

907
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:35,040
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own made-up math and when I was</font>

908
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:37,710
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at about sixty to a hundred</font>

909
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,910
thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remediate and clean</font>

910
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:43,500
up this effort alone but you add in this

911
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,348
business interruption the lost revenue

912
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,609
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> patients being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> diverted</font>

913
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:49,560
Hollywood Presbyterian makes nine

914
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:52,200
hundred seventy million dollars a year

915
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:56,270
if you do just<font color="#E5E5E5"> even some simple math</font>

916
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:58,109
that's about 2.6 million dollars a day

917
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:03,269
so for two days

918
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:06,509
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5.2 million dollars of revenue on</font>

919
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:11,339
those two days if even ten percent of

920
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:14,849
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> revenue was lost that's 260,000 or</font>

921
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:19,099
by person I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is math yes you're</font>

922
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:22,410
gonna love<font color="#CCCCCC"> it 260 thousand dollars on</font>

923
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:24,239
lost revenue so what's the biggest

924
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,339
impact to the organization from this

925
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">event it's not paying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the ransomware</font>

926
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:30,839
it's not the cleanup it's the lost

927
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:37,859
revenue from the patient's going

928
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:40,038
somewhere else yes ma'am<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what are the</font>

929
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,038
best

930
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,810
absolutely that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the wheels really</font>

931
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,810
come off the bus

932
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:10,430
yeah yeah and there's I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

933
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of reasons for that too I mean you</font>

934
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,190
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything so electronical</font>

935
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're moved to the paper</font>

936
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,970
documentation and you go to the

937
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:21,590
emergency room nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows how to do</font>

938
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:23,060
this on paper anymore exactly so they

939
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,200
miss a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and there is that's</font>

940
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,650
a whole nother that's one of those

941
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,779
extraordinary expenses that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

942
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,880
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to contemplate exactly what</font>

943
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be it is but I think you</font>

944
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">can also make the point to the</font>

945
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:37,160
management as well well we know what

946
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,350
medical malpractice is going to cost us

947
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,020
we can there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of good numbers</font>

948
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:43,940
around medical malpractice so if you can

949
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,190
take that event<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all right the</font>

950
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,480
patient wasn't cared for in the way that

951
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,850
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought they should have been cared</font>

952
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,010
for if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some parallels</font>

953
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:56,200
between the medical malpractice side of

954
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:59,300
that you can start to it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think maybe</font>

955
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,689
build some parallels between we know

956
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:05,510
what patient injury<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and we know</font>

957
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:08,810
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had some issue on our part that</font>

958
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,820
caused injury to the patient how much

959
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,680
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you expect delay medical treatment</font>

960
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:16,310
Acosta's is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical malpractice suit</font>

961
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:20,419
so even from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of yes maybe</font>

962
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:22,970
patient care was impacted you can there

963
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,310
are very known<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost examples that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

964
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:28,339
can tie it to and you can start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build</font>

965
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:30,190
some parallels there I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

966
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,990
throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> out another example as well</font>

967
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:35,660
rockhurst university in my hometown of

968
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kansas City I was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> victim of a phishing</font>

attack a little earlier this year on

970
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:43,759
April fourth and these scams<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

971
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:45,710
just going nuts the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this</font>

972
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,840
year but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course what happened it was</font>

973
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:53,810
pretty typical um the email came in

974
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,360
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the CFO who said hey</font>

975
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,610
you've had I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the w2 information</font>

976
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,080
from everybody over the past past year

977
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,240
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> email that to me real fast I</font>

978
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,610
mean the very diligent HR person says

979
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,669
yeah sure no problem and ended up

980
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:11,990
emailing 1300 w 2's to<font color="#E5E5E5"> who knows where a</font>

981
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,990
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical example of a fishing</font>

982
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:17,029
event but also I think another one where

983
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,970
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some good some good information</font>

984
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,609
to map to

985
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,810
impact they were fish they were fished

986
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,580
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourth they knew they were fished</font>

987
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:26,250
on the fourth well they knew they were

988
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,080
fish on six and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered it they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">confirmed it that didn't take an</font>

990
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,619
extraordinary technical response on

991
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,420
their part to confirm it it took some

992
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,609
investigation yes but nothing

993
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,380
particularly out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ordinary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

994
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:38,430
they did say hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as a result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,020

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">some additional awareness training for</font>

997
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,550
our staff again you see the coordination

998
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,609
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IRS and law enforcement outside</font>

999
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:49,140
agencies that's an impact of time staff

1000
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:51,869
communication they had to do the

1001
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,970
notification I'm also the CEO and other

1002
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,800
leaders are the lead administrator and

1003
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:59,270
other leadership spent time meeting with

1004
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,760
the folks and they offered<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years of</font>

1005
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:05,880
identity protection service and then go

1006
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,849
figure and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the staff was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1007
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,920
unhappy as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of this and whether</font>

1008
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:13,830
it was an outcome of how the information

1009
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:18,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">was communicated or just a larger</font>

1010
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:21,840
symptom of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of being an</font>

1011
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:24,300
employee rockers they brought a proposed

1012
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:27,960
class action on the twenty-fourth of

1013
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,420
this month and again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can apply the</font>

1014
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,609
math to this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1015
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,920
methodology you can run down how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

1016
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:37,920
hours did we spend from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical</font>

1017
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,200
point of view um what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did our general</font>

1018
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,880
counsel how many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they have to</font>

1019
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,250
spend on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font>

1020
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,920
their cost per hour the notification

1021
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,410
probably required outside counsel to

1022
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,410
bring in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how much you know</font>

1023
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:54,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do we have to notify when and how</font>

1024
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:57,089
staff meeting there were hours spent on

1025
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,550
staff time I'm everybody's hours were

1026
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:02,490
spent on that the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of the</font>

1027
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,980
identity remediation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now we have</font>

1028
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:06,569
legal fees but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think this starts to</font>

1029
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,490
illustrate the power of looking for

1030
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,220
impact because when we do look for

1031
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:15,839
impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we can you know again</font>

1032
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:18,450
equate<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs in terms of time money and</font>

1033
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,640
lost revenue to those but there's

1034
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">another important aspect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think of</font>

1035
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,410
looking for impact is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

1036
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:28,980
start to really dig into these things

1037
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start to ask some questions like why</font>

1038
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,680
did it take a week for them to declare a

1039
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,589
state of emergency

1040
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,259
see at<font color="#CCCCCC"> hollywood hospital why was it</font>

1041
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:40,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay at rockhurst university for them to</font>

1042
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:44,790
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and say yeah we can email w-2s</font>

1043
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:47,520
that's not a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> allison is not so</font>

1044
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:51,029
common um but it does start to bag some

1045
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,759
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions and we see it coming</font>

1046
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,980
up time and again that when we talk

1047
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,390
about breach costs the organization's

1048
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:03,660
start to lump into breach<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs the</font>

1049
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:06,240
actual cost of improving security after

1050
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:09,779
the event and this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

1051
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,250
astounding to me right and because what

1052
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we saying here we're saying that</font>

1053
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,790
well we knew that we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

1054
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">more awareness training but now we're</font>

1055
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,829
actually going to spend money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it or</font>

1056
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:22,020
we knew that we had some issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our</font>

1057
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,369
backup in our disaster recovery at

1058
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hollywood hospital but now we're</font>

1059
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:26,819
actually going to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money on it</font>

1060
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,020
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another great study out</font>

1061
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:29,849
there that I would recommend everybody

1062
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,119
taking a look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from the SANS</font>

1063
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:34,980
Institute um came out December of this

1064
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,160
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's cleaning up after a breach</font>

1065
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,630
the post-breach impact a cost compendium

1066
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,328
and I know it can be a little bit

1067
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,980
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read but over seventy</font>

1068
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:45,630
percent of the organizations that

1069
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,150
responded it said yeah we had some sort

1070
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,829
of security incident and as a result of

1071
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that incident we spent money on</font>

1072
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:55,049
administrative policy development we

1073
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:57,690
spent money on administrative training

1074
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:59,759
over sixty percent spent more money on

1075
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,040
technical tools purchased in order to

1076
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,950
respond or remediate this type of event

1077
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,500
in the future this to me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not breach</font>

1078
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost this is deferred paying the piper</font>

1079
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,960
right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is security spin that should</font>

1080
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,598
have been done early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> but didn't come</font>

1081
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,549
up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually had this event and</font>

1082
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,740
now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this out of cycle expense</font>

1083
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:21,540
and because it's an out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cycle expense</font>

1084
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,759
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it a breach cost I'm</font>

1085
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,290
and this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is another one of those</font>

1086
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,180
powers of actually looking for the

1087
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,670
impact and when you start to map if

1088
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,049
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say oh I need to invest</font>

1089
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,230
in awareness training because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1090
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:37,200
event no no that is not a legitimate

1091
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">breach cost that is simply putting off</font>

1092
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,279
the inevitable something that should

1093
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:46,050
have been done a while ago

1094
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,140
absolutely and when you combine not

1095
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,119
spending money on security with having a

1096
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,700
sort of that tenuous relationship with

1097
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,109
your folks and you get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1098
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:59,310
horrible outcomes and I think one of the

1099
00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:01,890
classic examples that we've seen of this

1100
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:05,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">lately is with the talk talk breach that</font>

1101
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,480
happened in October of this year I'm on

1102
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,760
the face of it is it was a fairly

1103
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,940
straightforward event right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1104
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk had a possibly compromise of their</font>

1105
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:18,930
other customer portal on a significant

1106
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,150
and sustained attack that may have

1107
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:23,040
compromised about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred seventy</font>

1108
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand customer names addresses email</font>

1109
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,359
addresses phone numbers and a little bit

1110
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">of credit and banking information as</font>

1111
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,109
well now talk doc has over<font color="#E5E5E5"> four million</font>

1112
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,640
customers and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

1113
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:38,960
157,000 in relationship to<font color="#E5E5E5"> four million</font>

1114
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,339
that's not a lot of their customer base

1115
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,609
in comparison to some of the things that

1116
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:47,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">we hear about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've seen 170,000</font>

1117
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:49,799
60,000 that's not significant maybe but

1118
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:53,099
not catastrophic it shouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

1119
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:57,599
catastrophic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is that is is the</font>

1120
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:59,700
point um but the very day after this

1121
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,390
breach came to light I'm you started to

1122
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:08,299
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting um chain of</font>

1123
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:11,640
events are very interesting backlash

1124
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,830
unfold yeah the folks at talktalk saying

1125
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,900
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh potentially it could</font>

1126
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,848
affect all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers which is why</font>

1127
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,339
we're contacting them all by email and

1128
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:21,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll write them as well the very next</font>

1129
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,490
day in the news customers are out there

is get safe online week immediately

1134
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,750
immediately the very next day<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font>

1135
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,118
were coming out in the media talking

1136
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you're not taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care of my</font>

1137
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,190
information you're not communicating

00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:46,740
with me and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay my bill</font>

1139
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,780
and what did all of that mean at the end

1140
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,689
of the day well it meant about 60

1141
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,910
million pounds to talk talk and there is

1142
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">really no reason why this breach should</font>

1143
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,960
have cost this much money particularly

1144
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,250
but they have had they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they'd</font>

1145
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,810
had a couple of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> events</font>

1146
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,140
beforehand before this happened

1147
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:06,210
customers were already leery of how they

1148
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:13,859
were how their information was being

1149
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:16,050
handled<font color="#E5E5E5"> um they uh they also as a mobile</font>

1150
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:17,880
phone a communication broadband provider

1151
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,589
they already have sort of a not very

1152
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,839
happy relationship with all of their

1153
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:24,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers I mean the gloves their</font>

1154
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,060
carrier right now some folks do some

1155
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,899
folks down right um so what did they

1156
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:32,578
spend 60 million pounds on while they

1157
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,910
spent 60 million pounds on incentives

1158
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:38,670
basically on trying to repair that brand

1159
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:41,399
image on trying to win their customers

1160
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:44,400
back after what should not have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1161
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,619
particularly severe event I'm yes they

1162
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,510
did spend money on forensic reviews and

1163
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:50,490
on security reviews which unfortunately

1164
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,369
uncovered and confirmed another breach

1165
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:57,390
that had happened with one of their call

1166
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:58,950
center facilities in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India they did</font>

1167
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:01,589
spend some<font color="#E5E5E5"> money on some new controls</font>

1168
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,839
and some new features and in there again

1169
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:05,880
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their in their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> filings they talked</font>

1170
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:08,310
that up as being a part of the breach

1171
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,490
response when really I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is</font>

1172
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:14,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">um but they also ended up spending a lot</font>

1173
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:17,490
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money on free upgrades to all of</font>

1174
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:20,400
their customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and free services to all</font>

1175
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:22,169
of their customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how far it</font>

1176
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,300
went it wasn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hundred and 50</font>

1177
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:27,630
some odd that were actually impacted it

1178
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,760
was everybody in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk talk family</font>

1179
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many of those how many how many</font>

1180
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,760
customers actually took that upgrade

1181
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:37,740
well almost 500,000 it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

1182
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,349
because when when there's services

1183
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:42,629
offered to you know the consumers or

1184
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:45,780
whoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be the impacted parties it</font>

1185
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:48,089
that uptake is typically more like ten

1186
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,710
percent or less so<font color="#CCCCCC"> offering free</font>

1187
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:55,200
services because your brand was so

1188
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:57,839
damaged is extraordinary on free

1189
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,700
services but that is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font>

1190
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what's the value of your brand</font>

1191
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:05,040
well they're almost is it's unlimited

1192
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:08,430
that in what organizations are willing

1193
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend to restore or preserve that</font>

1194
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:12,299
brand image

1195
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,640
that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really drives your costs up</font>

1196
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:17,580
and I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we make the</font>

1197
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,879
investment in security earlier to help

1198
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">offset some of these negative outcomes</font>

1199
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,250
if they hadn't had a number of incidents

1200
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:28,830
just before the October incident I'm if

1201
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:31,020
they had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to control that</font>

1202
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:32,220
security beforehand I'm if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

1203
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,380
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a slightly better</font>

1204
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,240
relationship with their customers this

1205
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:39,180
incident would have cost them a whole

1206
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,459
lot less so with that I hope that we've

1207
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:44,460
convinced everybody that some looking

1208
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">for impact out of a particular or out of</font>

1209
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,630
a particular incident is our place to

1210
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,779
start when we go for calculating the

1211
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:54,600
cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breach but it also is perfect</font>

1212
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:56,700
for understanding i think the value of

1213
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,580
investing in controls today and how it

1214
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">can prevent 60 million in the 60 million</font>

1215
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:09,660
pounds in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future so with that are</font>

1216
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:12,509
there any questions good because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1217
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,810
pretty much out of time thank you

1218
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,810
everyone
