00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,590
I'm an executive director with the

opposite see so it optiv opposite see so

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,280
is a team of 30 former chief security

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,550
officers that make up a team in advisory

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> opt-in so we plan build run security</font>

programs starting with your security

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,269
strategy and moving through to building

9
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:45,129
and deploying and providing the services

10
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:47,400
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting that program up</font>

00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,960
and running we also provide services for

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,120
managing what you have going on today

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,430
we're talking about breach response so

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,570
I'm the former CEO of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fortune 500</font>

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:01,000
retailer and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the spot at a kind</font>

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of precarious time for CISOs and retail</font>

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,670
organizations so certainly everybody

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,979
recalls when TJ maxx Home Depot had

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,289
their first but there were some

20
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:13,060
incidents that kind of preceded that we

21
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:17,920
saw things happening in retail that

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,869
drove the rise of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI framework but</font>

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,420
then we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the target incident which</font>

24
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:27,400
happened late in 2013 and things sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,350
changed for us in retail and all of a

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden I found myself underneath my desk</font>

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:36,399
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fetal position pretty much most</font>

28
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:38,380
of my day which was like you know 929 at

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,710
that time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided I was going to</font>

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,619
make myself an expert in breach response

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,750
I needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that when it happened</font>

32
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,610
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything in place because I really did</font>

34
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it happened to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us we were</font>

35
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,579
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,139
place so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and I found myself</font>

37
00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:01,750
the best breach lawyer that I could find

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,579
and then I seconded that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said well</font>

39
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Who am I going to bring in for forensics</font>

40
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:08,019
team and how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go down and</font>

41
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,789
so this presentation talks about one

42
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,709
what happens from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident</font>

43
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,650
management perspective what happens

44
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">after you've discovered an incident what</font>

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,549
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do after you've gone through the</font>

46
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,890
technical part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your cleanup you've</font>

47
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:23,620
discovered it what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do next right</font>

48
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,540
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we all get our cert plans right</font>

49
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,920
our incident response plans and some of

50
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,320
us have big<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones and some of us have</font>

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,589
small ones but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know what</font>

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,299
happens after the legal ramifications

53
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,660
that come with incidents the breach

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,280
disclosures that happen and then the

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,079
secondary question is this is kind of

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,569
evolved over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> as what do we do about</font>

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,670
insurance because<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite frankly and the</font>

58
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,768
insurance providers are in a different

59
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">place and that's kind of new for us most</font>

60
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,370
of us are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> now buying our first</font>

61
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,069
cyber liability policies some of us are

62
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:01,170
a couple years in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

63
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:05,078
ink my cyber liability policy binder on

64
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,880
december six which for everybody with a

65
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,400
great memory that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about two weeks</font>

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">before the target breach was disclosed</font>

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,560
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say fifteen percent by switching to</font>

68
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,390
geico that year so the long and the

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,680
short of it is there's a disconnect

70
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,179
between the CSO and the business units

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,319
they serve and it's time that we're kind

72
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of getting together and becoming</font>

73
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,750
business partners and that's the start

74
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the breach response conversation and</font>

75
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like this in at Golden Circle because</font>

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,069
for a lot of us we get stuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the what</font>

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:41,109
we do right we secure systems we lock

78
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff down we're looking for threats we</font>

79
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,760
manage risk we always talk about the

80
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it is that we do then we get to the</font>

81
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,569
how you know events like this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

82
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,470
get to your vendor floor you say well I

83
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:55,780
have XYZ branded firewalls I have a sim

84
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,840
tool I have advanced persistent threat

85
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,120
protection that's how I do the what I do

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,310
but we never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quit really get to</font>

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the why you know our group this is</font>

88
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,769
particularly bad at as technicians of

89
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,769
saying why are we doing this and that's

90
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,810
the business case for security so the

91
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,858
why are we doing this will help us drive

92
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,630
the what we really are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do in</font>

93
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:23,280
our communications with the business in

94
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,280
and around breach response

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,789
so we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the economics</font>

96
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">i love it when i put animations and i</font>

97
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:38,000
forget that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're so but the first is</font>

98
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,770
understanding that when we're talking

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,479
about the economics of reach management

100
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,008
we have to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business case</font>

101
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,979
for it because we all recognize that

102
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:48,199
we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cost center and that's</font>

103
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard for us to derive budget down</font>

104
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,190
it's really hard to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money come</font>

105
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,650
down from management when they don't

106
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">really see what our value is so getting</font>

107
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,620
to a place where we understand that

108
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:00,110
cyber security is an enterprise risk

109
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,410
management issue this is not an IT

110
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:06,169
function a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are still reporting</font>

111
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:09,139
into the CIO organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> or worse one</font>

112
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,330
step down below them putting us three

113
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,180
four maybe five steps below the

114
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,940
executive team that's an indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

115
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,460
your management has not yet recognized

116
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,090
that security is an enterprise risk not

117
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">a technology risk second understand the</font>

118
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,138
legal implications of cyber risks this

119
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,090
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coming back to the beginning</font>

120
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:33,409
when I told you when I was in the seat

121
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,719
as a retail see so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

122
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,699
the best outside counsel I could find I

123
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,440
went to find a breach lawyer and the

124
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,000
number one question after this is who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

125
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,180
he I'll give you a list because I

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,919
interviewed<font color="#E5E5E5"> five I have three and I have</font>

127
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">one go to number three have regular</font>

128
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,820
updates and access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cybersecurity</font>

129
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:55,039
experts so often to see so we talked

130
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,880
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an advisory function I advisory</font>

131
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,820
arm of optiv so I'm an unbuilt resource

132
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,000
to you what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it means you</font>

133
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,860
have access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my team of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 CISOs if</font>

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,380
you want to bounce some ideas off of us

135
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,550
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about strategy make sure you have</font>

136
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,469
that like sensical thing am I crazy

137
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,210
being a CSO is a really lonely and

138
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:20,719
isolating job because you're in conflict

139
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,508
with people<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost every day but you're</font>

140
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:25,969
not in conflict with me so have access

141
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,030
to other cyber security resources other

142
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:31,219
knowledgeable experts because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you try</font>

143
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,650
to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on just yourself or just your</font>

144
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:35,810
team you get caught and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

145
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,310
see your blind spots you don't know what

146
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,440
you don't know number four

147
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,610
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> I enterprise-wide risk management</font>

148
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,040
framework frameworks are sticky right

149
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,270
our internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit teams love them to</font>

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,400
check to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're hearing two</font>

151
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,620
frameworks but it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best way to</font>

152
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,770
communicate that we are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

153
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,800
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are setting out to do the it is</font>

154
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,930
connecting me what we do with the why we

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
do it okay so look into the framework

156
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,660
pick one that matches best for your

157
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization and roll with it and then</font>

158
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,260
lastly sit down talk to your management

159
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how you want to avoid accept or</font>

160
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,700
mitigate risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay our transfer the risk</font>

161
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,650
in the form of cyber liability insurance

162
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,469
so that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of kick off our</font>

163
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,080
next conversation about cyber liability

164
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:28,680
so the economics of a breach is that 450

165
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">billion per year 5.85 million per breach</font>

166
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,900
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is roughly what it's costing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

167
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,850
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a security incident</font>

168
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,280
so I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers</font>

169
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,620
because we've all seen it but the point

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is cyber liability insurance isn't</font>

171
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,180
going to cover everything and so what

172
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,710
happens is we see these<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font>

173
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,050
management sees these numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

174
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,460
say okay it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs a hundred million</font>

175
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,370
dollars for anthem I need a

176
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,109
hundred-million-dollar policy this isn't

177
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,060
reasonable right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how you come</font>

178
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to that define your enterprise risk</font>

179
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,890
management strategy figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

180
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:06,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to accept mitigate or</font>

181
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:09,180
transfer your risks so here's what the

182
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,730
claims paid out at so there's a negative

183
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,290
three percent a 13-percent there or less

184
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,300
than thirteen percent of the total cost

185
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,730
of a reach was actually paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

186
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,950
insurance claims so that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

187
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,480
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt right so part of the rest of</font>

188
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,030
this conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

189
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,600
well how do I shrink what a breach is

190
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:30,659
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs me down so that that you</font>

191
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,820
know thirteen percent that is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

192
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:38,520
actually covered will will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> less rare</font>

193
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I didn't say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right so that what is</font>

194
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,000
covered cover you cover more you have

195
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,630
less that you're actually having to

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">write the check for it's interesting I</font>

197
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,630
spoke to a coverage lawyer today so this

198
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a new</font>

199
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,800
thing you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always said your</font>

200
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,780
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> call after breach should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be to</font>

201
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,939
your cyber security council who's your

202
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,270
outside counsel and then they will

203
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:04,230
engage your forensic provider well I

204
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:06,510
spoke to a liability coverage coverage

205
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,150
counselor coverage lawyer and he said no

206
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,430
no call your insurance company first the

207
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,620
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think you have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incident</font>

208
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,989
you call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can follow</font>

209
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,000
your policy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can follow your plan to</font>

210
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,250
the letter but if you haven't called

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">them early in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your process you may find</font>

212
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,530
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have coverage kind of the</font>

213
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,330
other flip side of that was also make

214
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you've defined all of these people</font>

215
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">in accordance with your policy before</font>

216
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,010
the incident happens so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

217
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,050
of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like health care coverage you have</font>

218
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,060
in network out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of network and damn we</font>

219
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,380
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not paying for it the same</font>

220
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing happens with cyber liability</font>

221
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,370
insurance so they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a preferred</font>

222
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,410
provider list and you will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

223
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">choose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the preferred provider list</font>

224
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,120
who your forensics team is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

225
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,340
and who your liability<font color="#E5E5E5"> Council will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

226
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,290
but in addition to that get your

227
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,030
coverage council because that guy's

228
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,670
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start fighting your legal</font>

229
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,410
battle to get your claims paid before

230
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,979
you've even gotten to the place where

231
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,630
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not paying them so that this was</font>

232
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,610
a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> revelation for me this morning I</font>

233
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,290
flew in this morning at eleven thirty

234
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,540
and I was on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy on</font>

235
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,780
my way here and he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

236
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,819
explaining that to me so in the vein of

237
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,709
reducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that which you actually have to</font>

238
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,050
pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to start with what</font>

239
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,460
are the breach response objectives now

240
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,740
I'm saying breach response and we all

241
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,170
know that that's like that word is

242
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:32,250
verboten right it's a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident</font>

243
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,349
until somebody says otherwise so but for

244
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,030
the entire incident management platform

245
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,100
and I should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> update my slide to</font>

246
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,560
say the incident management objectives

247
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,380
is minimize impact you're doing nothing

248
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">more in this process than trying to</font>

249
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,480
minimize the impact of the breach not

250
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,989
just the technical half not the wiry

251
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,570
that's the what happened but the legal

252
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,610
fallout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regulatory issues and</font>

253
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,740
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will come after for your</font>

254
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,600
reputation so we're minimizing impact

255
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,520
across the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we're going</font>

256
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was fronted</font>

257
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,810
demonstrate transparency so I already

258
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,579
said once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> discover you've had an</font>

259
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,560
incident then you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> next call</font>

260
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,200
your cyber liability insurance provider

261
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,770
and be like yo I need a forensics team

262
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,930
and your forensics team is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

263
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">lead you through the exercise you want</font>

264
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep your hands up where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we wear</font>

265
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,240
white cats we ride white horses we are

266
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,920
good people in something bad has

267
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,200
happened to us in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way that we</font>

268
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,780
can demonstrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is by allowing a</font>

269
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,400
third party to do what they need to do

270
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and provide the facts of the incident</font>

271
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,600
you're establishing reasonableness now

272
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FTC s in the SEC</font>

273
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,740
favorite word's was your security

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,880
program reasonable did you do what you

275
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,470
were supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is what they're</font>

276
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,210
saying now<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that framework</font>

277
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,460
conversation if you're following<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

278
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,560
framework you most<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly can</font>

279
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,300
demonstrate reasonableness<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so make</font>

280
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,160
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your security program is built</font>

281
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,790
on something else other than bill said

282
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,709
so last has<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed communications this</font>

283
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,939
one is critically important so adoptive

284
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:09,320
we have an enterprise incident

285
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,540
management team and the first thing we

286
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,130
tell that team is let's establish right

287
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,560

until you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened will use</font>

target as the example 30 million credit

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,649
cards right everybody knows that story

446
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:56,440
30 million credit cards we're impacted

447
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,140
not stolen and i don't care if they're

448

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">now they can't leave with the data right</font>

450
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,440
so after target gets done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all their</font>

452
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,690
that packs up and leaves turns out less

453
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,870
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% of the credit card data that was</font>

454
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">reported was actually exfiltrated take</font>

455
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,300
the time do it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so don't get</font>

456
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,429
quick to announce because you've got

457
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,590
pressures from the media pressures from

458
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,300
management pressures from your PR team

459
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,570
to step up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give the information to</font>

460
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,570
quickly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you create your legal</font>

461
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,760
class of victims as soon as you disclose

462
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,879
that so 30 million transactions were

463
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,040
impacted that's how many transactions

464
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,320
went by the malware that's not how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

465
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,120
left and that's important so make sure

466
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,980
you're taking the time in order to

467
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,679
manage the communications out you need

468
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">those two things done first</font>

469
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,360
alright so who's on the team<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you</font>

470
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,490
have your technical team these are your

471
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,870

472
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the team that knows this that you're</font>

473
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,679
doing your red team exercises your table

474
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,020
topping with them you've practiced

475
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,220
you've done the drills these are your

476
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,840
guys that know the stuff the next is the

477
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,520
business team is your executive team

478
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,610
general counsel media relations and

479
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,310
customer relations don't lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> sight of</font>

480
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,129
whoever is responsible for the employees

481
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:24,040
that face customers so as the head of a

482
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:27,700
retailer we had to have a very specific

483
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,940
communication plan drafted for store

484
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,860
employees because it's very easy to sit

485
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">back in your corporate office and tell</font>

486
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,959
everybody not to say anything but as

487
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,170
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Krebs reports it or the news</font>

488
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:45,010
gets it your frontline employees are in

489
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:46,540
my case 16 year olds are left talking to

490
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,760
the customer make sure you know what

491
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,100
they're going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in that</font>

492
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,290
business team make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that's covered</font>

provider outside counsel being the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

496
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,159
your breach lawyer and your coverage

497
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,620
lawyer so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be from the</font>

498
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,030
same firm that was part of the

499
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,189
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had today because what</font>

500
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,350
ends up happening is the breach lawyer

501
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,200
is arguing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that insurance should pay for</font>

502
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">their work so if your breach lawyer and</font>

503
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,210
your coverage lawyer come from the same

504
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,040
firm it's like Reed Smith is demanding

505
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,590
their money and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should pay</font>

506
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,240
them because we read Smith are also

507
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,980
coverage lawyers right it's self-serving

508
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,170
it doesn't look right it ends up being

509
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">ugly so make sure you have two firms for</font>

510
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so you know everybody has</font>

511
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">a plan until they get punched in the</font>

512
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">mouth is one of my favorite so when you</font>

513
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your incident response plan I am</font>

514
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:45,430
seeing some crazy incident response

515
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:47,669
plans like 84 pages who's guilty of the

516
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:51,370
50 plus page incident response plan oh

517
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:53,560
you're lying forget it so your incident

518
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,409
response plan should wave like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

519
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,570
it should include<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like bill is a</font>

520
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,840
certified incident handler bill will

521
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:04,379
follow industry standards for<font color="#E5E5E5"> blah five</font>

522
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:12,480
bullets because if you have step

523
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:16,059
23<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 1d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Bill mrs. step 23 a 1d</font>

524
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:21,460
negligence those lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> love that stuff</font>

525
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:22,840
ok so don't have step 23 a 1 B so it

526
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,840
should wave like this it should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

527
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,629
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table like a phone book and I</font>

528
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,559
have seen them I have seen them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

529
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">these gigantic binders I have seen them</font>

530
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:39,639
stored on network shares listed incident

531
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,340
response plan because like I'm sure your

532
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:44,408
hacker didn't think to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look there right</font>

533
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,289
so let's be logical about how we're

534
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:49,240
doing things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay again mayonnaise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

535
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:53,289
once I once was a I was aqsa at some

536
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,149
point and my pen tester got in in 20

00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:57,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes which was just like horrifying</font>

538
00:22:55,149 --> 00:23:00,340

539

can you just give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah give me some</font>

542
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,658
background he goes well I don't know

543
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,949
there was a fold around their network

544
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:13,749
share that said don't touch these

545
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,519
servers as I touched him right like

550
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:29,320
a business one you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said to</font>

00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:53,949
information that there ever was some

561
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,399
ups is when you're trying to demonstrate

562
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,440
what data is lost and what data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

563
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:01,090
as there's four states right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that</font>

are requiring you to disclose even if

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,549
you lose encrypted data and the reason

566
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:08,649
for that is your business people in

567
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:11,110
their data assets because they will tell

568

you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of creation needs access to</font>

fantastically expensive but awesome

583
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,090
behavioral analytics tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,830
tell us when something bad is going on

585
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:56,320
in our environment so all right so how

when to kneel we got it when to stand

590
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,360
right we do the same routine every

591
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,230
Sunday<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have been raised on it it's a</font>

595
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,330
to say that the church is pretty

596
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard but you find yourself standing</font>

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:26,409
when everyone else is kneeling and you

598
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,780

you my infos on the last slide

640
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,780
discourage blame storming this is really

641
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,320
hard that comes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that text that I</font>

642
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,810
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like we wear white</font>

643
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,200
hats we ride white horses we do good

644
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,610
things so let's try to ensure or get

645
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">your management on board with the fact</font>

646
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:31,729
that security incidents are

647
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:35,300
eventualities having somebody in the

648
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:38,480
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> is likely having someone</font>

649
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:41,990
take stuff maybe not as likely but if

650
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,390
they do blame storming costs money so

651
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,700
don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't work</font>

652
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:49,520
out it doesn't play<font color="#CCCCCC"> out well and</font>

653
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,740
unfortunately as security folks you know

654
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,230
the finger ends up pointing at us and we

655
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">all kind of do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hmmm but</font>

656
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:59,120
you promised me eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and a two</font>

657
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,560
million dollar budget and I didn't have

658
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,629
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you end up on this</font>

659
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,919
internal bickering well you've got a

660
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,030
lawyer on the phone at a thousand

661
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,370
dollars an hour you guys are bickering

662
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,840
about whose fault it is you know thirty

663
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,600
thousand dollars later<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're no further</font>

664
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,879
in your investigation but your<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer is</font>

665
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,750
buying his new yacht okay so let's be

666
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,250
mindful of that so early communications

667
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,140
equate to bigger expenses I don't know

668
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,740
if I pointed this out earlier maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

669
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,180
missed it don't don't go early<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay get</font>

674
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise we don't care what the media</font>

675
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:40,040
thinks it's a proven fact Americans are

676
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,610
in breach fatigue right now they kind of

677

720
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,340
the part we know the parts that we don't

721
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,980
know is when are we prepared to ask for

722
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,600
help right we're demonstrating

723
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,730
reasonableness we're taking

724
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,649
accountability we have identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

725
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:26,549
security incident that may have involved

726
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:29,429
data and we're reaching out now early to

727
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:31,110
legal counsel so that any conversation

728
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:34,620
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be under privileged and not</font>

729

disclosed in a court of law establish

730
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,689
your breach management objectives what

731
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,690
did I say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

732
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:44,009
minimize impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so your breach</font>

733
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,529
response objectives should be the same

734
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:48,419
but put three bullets under there in the

735
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:51,299
coming back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sin x golden circle</font>

736
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:53,579
why are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep</font>

737
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:55,769
standing in front of your slides so

738
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming back to the why we do this and</font>

739
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:00,119
your bridge response objectives your why

740
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:02,129
you're doing this should very closely

741
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,769
tie with your organizational mission and

742
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:08,279
vision statements and this is a good way

743
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:10,679
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this conversation lastly is the</font>

744
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,579
legal rule of three this is kind of a

745
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:20,179
giggly thing but it's it's an actual

746
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:24,178
thing in incident management you may not

747
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:29,279
under any<font color="#CCCCCC"> circumstances ever say things</font>

748
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:32,549
like we didn't have enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> money it</font>

749
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,249
interfered with the business it takes

750
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:37,229
too long<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the those are</font>

751
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:40,379
the legal rule of three any one of those

752
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:42,450
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go oh you're oh</font>

753
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:44,488
you're in I mean that's the same as<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

754
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,779
admitting guilt so understand and talk

755
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:47,219
to your management right now about the

756
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,200
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are not going to be able</font>

757
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:52,739
to say to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of court in a</font>

758
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,999
breach and that's it costs too much the

759
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:56,959
business didn't like it interferes

760
00:31:53,999 --> 00:32:01,379
buckle black or doesn't align business

761
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:02,549
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> last time takes too long okay</font>

762
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,678
because people say that's me all the

763
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:07,289
time oh well that was on the budget plan

764
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,089
for next year we pushed it off of this

765
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:11,279
year it was on a budget plan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

766
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:14,969
next year and they go but you we see it

778
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:46,859
coverage council this morning so that

779
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know kind of didn't make it into the</font>

780
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:52,300
slides but

781
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,300
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a question</font>

782
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,280
this is

783
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:49,260
yep right so we're minimizing impact the

784
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:51,928
economic impact is you have to do these

785
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,600
steps in order to minimize the kind of

786
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cost to the company and figuring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

787
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,428
which steps are most valuable so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

788
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,640
what we're you know I understand what

789
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:03,870
you're saying an opportunity cost but I

790
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're really talking about</font>

791
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,860
here in terms of pitching it to

792
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,399
management is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost us more</font>

793
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,868
if we don't do these five things you

794
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,759
know Larry Ponemon will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

795
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:17,700
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of breach costs this is how</font>

796
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,190
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it costs if we don't exercise these</font>

797
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:23,359
preparedness steps and this is the

798
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:25,470
deviant on your transfer risk

799
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,629
opportunity because we see that come up

800
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:30,388
a lot as management<font color="#CCCCCC"> will say we have</font>

801
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,859
insurance or how much insurance do we

802
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:33,119
need I get that one a lot because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

803
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:36,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">always start out with a hundred million</font>

804
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,530
dollars that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go okay but</font>

805
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,879
they're not going to pay PCI fines and

806
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,700
specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told me this</font>

807
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:48,560
morning I'm not to call them finds call

808
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,560
them assessments

809
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:55,418
payment card industry standard so

810
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,040
anybody who processes credit cards

811
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:59,740
follows a standard and they have to pay

812
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,350
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the card replacement costs</font>

813
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,990
any fraud on those transactions and so

814
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:09,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> brands will come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the your</font>

815
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,689
company and ask for that money back and

816
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:17,230
the insurance providers historically go

817
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:19,060
no no so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around that and</font>

818
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:26,340
it kind of comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to reporting you</font>

819
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:26,340
had a question yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

820
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,910
right

821
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:44,070
mmhmm yeah so it's very funny because i

822
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,080
am going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends with brian krebs</font>

823
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:49,440
and the reason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because during the</font>

824
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">target incident my CEO said well you</font>

825
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,109
have to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and was</font>

826
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,550
like well nobody knows yet you know it's

827
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:55,770
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> was released he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like well I</font>

828
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,000
need you to find out we have a meeting

829
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,000
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board on Friday and it was a</font>

830
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,680
Wednesday and I called Brian directly so

831
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,020
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have had quite a few</font>

832
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,279
conversations around this because what

833
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,490
ends up happening is you sign up for

834
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,300
credit monitoring and then what happens

835
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:15,149
or what has happened what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> credit</font>

836
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,849
monitoring company was breached so

837
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:20,130
you've just get extra given but you can

838
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:23,430
put a freeze on your accounts through

839
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,730
TransUnion Experian and Equifax that

840
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,230
prevents any opening of new accounts

841
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,490
this is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people who are</font>

842
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,140
terrific at managing their credit

843
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,459
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I always say I don't</font>

844
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,960
shop where I bank I don't bank where

845
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,119
shop so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one of those</font>

846
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,190
people that opens a credit card to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

847
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,290
five percent on that transaction the

848
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,730
freeze works great you already have a

849
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,920
home loan you already have a car<font color="#CCCCCC"> loan</font>

850
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,290
and to lift<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all you have to do is</font>

851
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,750
call verify your identity over the phone

852
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,480
they'll lift the<font color="#CCCCCC"> freeze you open</font>

853
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,220
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need a new car and then you</font>

854
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,050
freeze it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> up again I definitely</font>

855
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,560
advocate that over the credit watch

856
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:01,410
credit monitoring and also that doesn't

857
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,549
cover you the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unspoken thing I</font>

858
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,920
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some folks here from health</font>

872
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:15,830
ahead what's oh right because the major

873
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,580
costs associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a breach are</font>

874
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:21,470
coming in the forms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those fines and</font>

875
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,830
penalties that come from compliance

00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:28,189
violations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pci recovery right so our</font>

877
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:31,340
most expensive breaches are the credit

878
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:35,690
card ones right now and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not</font>

879
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:39,050
paid back you know targets breach they

880
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,790
have been hesitant to identify what that

881
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,640
actual number<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and it's hard to</font>

882
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">quantify because it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmastime</font>

883
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">and their sales were down but they also</font>

884
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:51,020
gave discounts and things so it's very

885
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,480
hard to quantify but in the actual real

886
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,100
costs of breach the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of the</font>

887
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,180
money comes out and repaying the car

888
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:01,460
brands on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the banks and that is</font>

889
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,720
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> not covered and again this</font>

890
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,110
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comes back to for those of you</font>

891
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,450
who are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at new policies or</font>

892
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:10,330
renewing policies good time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach out</font>

893
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,919
to coverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> council i also have those</font>

894
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:15,290
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we know two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those i feel</font>

895
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's a new phase of law but the</font>

896
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:20,870
point of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe consult with them</font>

897
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,910
now and find those clauses so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

898
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,710
bought my<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy for urban there is this</font>

899
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:29,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">anti-terrorism clause that says it won't</font>

900
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:35,210
cover any act that originates from

901
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:37,790
abroad so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you know</font>

902
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:42,580
hopes there was also one<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite in there</font>

903
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:47,230
that it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not pay out on a tax of</font>

904
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,230
theological or ideological means

905
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,600
so you have to find those things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

906
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,630
them out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to do that is</font>

907
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:58,319
a to be you know junior lawyer type

908
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:00,270
person and find those places or to have

909
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,040
coverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> counsel when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about so</font>

910
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,990
coverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> counsel to spend an hour with</font>

911
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,200
them is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost you about 600</font>

912
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:09,450
bucks just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it saving millions on the</font>

913
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">back side right same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with breach</font>

914
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">counsel you can interview these guys and</font>

915
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,230
have some great fact finding information

916
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,580
moments with them for free because

917
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,500
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do their first session</font>

918
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,670
because they want your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business right</font>

919
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,020
and then if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow up</font>

920
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,240
conversation all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so cost you a</font>

921
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,390
thousand bucks right this is cheap money

922
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,100
in the scheme of the breach management

923
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,660
thing and a lot of my presentation came

924
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,910
from those conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of</font>

925
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the fact that I you know I really</font>

926
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,660
buddied up to three of them and I've

927
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">given this presentation with the</font>

928
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,950
coverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> council</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I talked this</font>

929
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,590
morning and a breach lawyer not this one

930
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:46,160
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much but a variant of is there</font>

931
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,160
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

932
00:40:51,670 --> 00:41:02,750
yeah that's yeah and so it's kind of I'm

933
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,950
not moving off that slide so that you

934
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,780
stop asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions about it i'm</font>

935
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:09,259
moving to back so that you can you can

936
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,490
get my contact information but yes so

937
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:15,890
that's kind of comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to that</font>

938
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:20,149
coverage question around how much

939
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:23,990
insurance do you actually need you know

940
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:26,000
if you don't carry credit card data if

941
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:29,959
you don't have credit card data you're

942
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,650
not going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> as high a policy areas</font>

943
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,540
to look out for that we see coverage

944
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:38,210
we're not seeing it covered covered is

945
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:40,940
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have had that mysterious</font>

946
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,880
email from the CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking that you know</font>

947
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">30 million dollars be wired to him at</font>

948
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,650
this number so insurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

949
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,270
cover that because somebody was sitting

950
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,070
behind the keyboard made a business

951
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,720
decision you didn't have a control in

952
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,320
place to limit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that risk they're not</font>

953
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:01,160
going to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so you know keeping</font>

954
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:03,170
those kinds of things in mind makes you

955
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,810
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some of those tools you</font>

956
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,940
know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean but we see that we're</font>

957
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,910
seeing that one a lot right now we're

958
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of ransomware activities</font>

959
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:16,460
and insurance is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay your</font>

960
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,740
ransom where payout so if you decide

961
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to pay they are not going</font>
