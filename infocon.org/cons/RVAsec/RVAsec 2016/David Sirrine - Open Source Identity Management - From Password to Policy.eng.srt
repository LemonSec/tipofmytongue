34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so identity to me is is</font>

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,659
way more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a username and</font>

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">password and it should be for everybody</font>

37
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,049
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I fell under the misconception</font>

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,420
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the preconception that identity</font>

39
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:15,060
management was you know who's in what

40
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,738
group what's their password policy you

41
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,530
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> those types of things you know very</font>

42
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">very low level things but the more you</font>

43
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,209
think about it the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get into it</font>

44
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:26,010
it's way more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right so you</font>

45
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,710
have to define what identity means to

46
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,079
you

47
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,390
everything has an identity this screen

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,050
this projector has an identity that door

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,630
has an identity right you know I'm more

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,720
part of my identity so you know

57
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,020
identities are people places things

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,300
right things host services devices

59
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,500
they're all identities they all have

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,680
their own unique unique place in our

61
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,310
environments and and descriptors that

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,980
define them so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a unique</font>

67
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this important right so knowing is</font>

68
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,770
half the battle all right and please

69

70
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you very much so your identities your</font>

71
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,870
your username your password that tells

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,760
you who you have and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing</font>

73
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">what service servers you have you know</font>

74
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,850
when you join a server to your domain

75
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,040
you have that list of service so you

76
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what you have so that provides you</font>

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,890
to whom what now policy provides you the

78
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,980
when where and why and policy is part of

<font color="#CCCCCC">your identity policy is applied to your</font>

80
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,739
identity right so that goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know the driving analogy you know that's</font>

82
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:13,510
that's policy so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

83
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,529
you need to be able to identify not just

84
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,269
who you have but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can they access</font>

85
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:22,570
why can they access it how can they

86
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,460
access it right and you need a method by

87
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,290
which you can control that by which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

88
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,940
can start setting and applying that

89

101
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,820
there you've got openldap you've got MIT

102
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,280
kerberos you've got all these components

103
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">all these bits and pieces that you can</font>

104
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,049
kind of cobble together to make your own

105
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,010
kind of identity provider you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> samba</font>

106
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:17,400
and you know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that today I'm</font>

107
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus more on free IPA and a</font>

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,669
couple other sundry things free IPA is a

109
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:29,640
project it exists in the Fedora project

110
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,370
universe stands for identity policy and

111
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,469
audit it's a bit of a misnomer because

112
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,730
we have focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> more on identity and</font>

113
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:42,240
policy and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much audit as as folks</font>

114
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,600
would like us to but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working on</font>

115
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so we're again we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to focus</font>

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,820
a little bit more extensively on on free

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,780
IPA than anything else today so here's

118
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,510
kind of a very broad broad stroke

119
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,340
overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architecture free IPA</font>

120
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,260
comes it's essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a domain</font>

121
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,409
controller for your Linux environment it

122
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:11,099
has KDC built-in it's got pki built in

123
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:16,290
ldap<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns a really robust command-line</font>

124
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:19,290
interface and GUI interface you can use

125
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,050
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authenticate linux systems unix</font>

126
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,320
systems anything really anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

127
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,480
can authenticate to an ldap identity

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,230
store you can authenticate against IDM

129
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,060
or a free IPA because it is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

130
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,630
else just a standards-based ldap

131
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:41,810
implementation with a bunch of other

132
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,810
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and usability aspects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built in</font>

133
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,830
so digging in a little bit more to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

134
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more insight into</font>

135
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what's going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here each</font>

136
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,050
component is provided by individual

137
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,759
projects so

138
00:06:52,050 --> 00:07:01,710
Oh York<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is provided by MIT kerberos</font>

139
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:05,520
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS is provided by a bind bind dine</font>

140
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,888
DB and bind ldap everything free IPA

141
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,969
does everything it manages is stored in

142
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:14,720
ldap so that also makes it really easy

143
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,099
for you to do your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own custom reporting</font>

144
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,470
it as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you know how to do an ldap</font>

145
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:23,940
search you can get the data out of ldap

146

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,979
it provides all that functionality and

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,460
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> client server based so the server is</font>

153
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:50,909
IP a server the clients are free IP a

154
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:54,359
client so you would set up your free IPA

155
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:57,000
server and then on your individual hosts

156
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,370
you would run free<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would install</font>

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,289
the client portion of it and it'll join

158
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,590
it to the domain automatically add the

160
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,508
server you know and configure your

authentication to authenticate against

162
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,090
it it'll do all that for you and then

163
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,940
you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other component here which</font>

164
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,489
is sssd think of that as your

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,409
authentication gateway that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

166
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,719
you're configuring to tell your your

<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux systems to you know I want to</font>

168
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,349
authenticate against free IPA and this

169
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,189
is what i want free IPA to provide back

170
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:39,718
to me so any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions so</font>

171
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:41,669
far sir yeah that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

172
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,500
just linux-based so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was the</font>

173
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,930
free IP the free IP a client is that

174
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,940
just linux-based or is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX aspect</font>

175
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,589
to that it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux there may be</font>

176
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,120
some some hand-rolled implementations

177
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,459
out there for like maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> BSD or</font>

178
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,270
something like that but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,640
provided by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> project it's it's</font>

180
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,660
there's an installer for you boon to

181
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,350
obviously fedora

182
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:12,530
rell sent off those types of

183
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:15,720
implementations thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

184
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,689
free IPA the features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it provides</font>

185
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:23,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's your centralized authentication you</font>

186
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:25,650
know Kerberos by a Kerberos or LDAP it

187
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">also you know manages your identities so</font>

188
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:32,310
your users groups your host host group's

189
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,630
net groups services again you know we're

190
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,849
started we're starting to broaden the

191
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,700
scope of what what is an identity you

192
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> services definitely an identity</font>

193
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,630
because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what what</font>

194
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,619
services we have running where they're

195
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:48,300
running and how people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can access them</font>

196
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,370
you know some<font color="#E5E5E5"> user lifecycle management</font>

197
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,290
aspect here so you know we have

198
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,970
different different levels you could

199
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,099
have staged users where you know you

200
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,050
have a group of say interns coming in in

201
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,630
a month you can stage them up they're

202
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,089
inactive ready to go but they have no

203
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,790
real policy applied to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> until you</font>

204
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,680
put them active and then folks can start

205
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,150
using those identities and then once

206
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,719
they're done if you need to preserve

207
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,730
them for auditing purposes or you know

208
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,890
if it's a if it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract or who's on</font>

209
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,240
a you know nine-month contract in three

210
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,069
months off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then comes back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

211
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,630
another nine month contract you could

212
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,860
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a preserved state and then</font>

213
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,189
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back you can move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

214
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">back into an active</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state so it helps</font>

215
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,210
you ensure that you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

216
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:34,590
any active users who should not be

217
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:36,960
active and manageability so it's a

218
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,780
simple installation script so for IP a

219
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,810
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP it's free iph server dash</font>

220
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,730

221
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,319
questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whether whether</font>

222
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,480
or not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use DNS what you want</font>

223
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,280
your realm name to be you know what your

224
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,820
passwords are going to be you can also

225
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,550
pass it in answers file to to help

226
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">automate that process as well same thing</font>

227
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,650
with the client side it's just free<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP a</font>

228
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,620
client install and it'll ask you a

229
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:07,260
couple questions it does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client side</font>

230
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,350
will do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns lookup against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an SRV</font>

231
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,990

232
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,889
any automatically discover any existing

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,170
free IPA servers in your infrastructure

234
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,889
it'll ask you we found this one do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

235
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:25,209
want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right to authenticate</font>

236
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:27,790
against so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a very rich</font>

237
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:31,809
command-line interface and web-based you

238
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:36,579
I it's all based on a back-end restful

239
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:40,959
api that will be exposed and supported

240
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:43,029
here soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope but that means anything</font>

241
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can do in the UI you can do in</font>

242
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,959
the command line interface and vice

243
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,699
versa we try and keep feature parity

244
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,309
between the UI in the command line

245
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:54,069
interface really helpful when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:57,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to automate these workflows these</font>

247
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:58,929
business processes right because the

248
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,779
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can automate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and build it</font>

249
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:04,988
into your your business needs in your

250
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:07,689
business workflow the less likely you're

251
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:09,910
going to have you know errant users out

252
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:12,279
there just hanging out not doing

253
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,779
anything and that shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be right you</font>

254
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,220
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can automate the most better</font>

255
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:19,179
you can automate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better the better</font>

256
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:21,549
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so and flexi flexible</font>

257
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:23,499
delegation of administrative roles so we

258
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:26,110
could get pretty granular about when we

259
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:29,079
set up administrators<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free IPA what</font>

260
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,389
can they do you know can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just view</font>

261
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:35,949
users can we modify users can we create

262
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:38,350
users are we can we limit folks to just

263
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:40,419
managing policies like can can this

264
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,029
person just be a pseudo rules

265
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:46,379
administrator you know we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

266
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:48,669
granular with how we can delegate

267
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:55,299
administrative responsibilities within

268
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:57,819
free IPA so of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> features</font>

269
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,970
replication again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is a</font>

270
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:02,169
pretty standards-based ldap

271
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,299
implementation so you can have

272
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:06,549
multi-master replication agreements

273
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:09,939
between multiple free IPA servers this

274
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:12,269
helps to distribute load and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

275
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:16,599
helps you scale within your environment

276
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:18,730
also helps for you know redundancy

277
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,369
disaster recovery type situations as

278
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">well so recommended deployment is</font>

279
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:25,939
usually two to three thousand clients

280
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,299
per server so when it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

281
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:30,769
clients I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> host so you know if</font>

282
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,949
you're if you're connecting two to three

283
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:36,019
thousand servers to a single free<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP a</font>

284
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:37,459
server instance then you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

285
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,729
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolling out another free IP</font>

286
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:45,919
a server to to start picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up some of</font>

287
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:48,199
those additional clients so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

288
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,109
the details depend on the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

289
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:53,659
centers and the geographical locations

290
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:55,849
so you know you can you can pretty much

291
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:58,279
set it up however you want in your

292
00:13:55,849 --> 00:14:00,220
environment right so if you have if you

293
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">have data centers in the US and the UK</font>

294
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have free IPA servers in both</font>

295
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:07,399
locations set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a replication agreement</font>

296
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,868
between them and that way your

297
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,889
authentication you're authenticating

298
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:15,379
locally in certain instances so any

299
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:17,479
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and still no questions all</font>

300
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:18,949
right back up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> restore there's a</font>

302
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:22,878
can backup and restore here you know

303
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,859
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some tools that come with it you</font>

304
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,419
have debe de back and db2<font color="#CCCCCC"> L div so you</font>

305
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:29,239
can either take a binary copy of your

306
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:34,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">database or you can take a full</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ldf dump</font>

307
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:37,009
of your databases so and compatibility

308
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:39,858
with a broad set of clients again you

309
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,089
know this is what we what we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

310
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:42,139
compatibility with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the broad set of</font>

311
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,849
clients is going to depend on what

312
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,069
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for when you when you</font>

313
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,569
yourself think about compatibility so

314
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:50,209
again anything that can authenticate

315
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:52,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">against just a very basic ldap</font>

316
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,559
infrastructure can authenticate against

317
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">lvad right so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you pointed to</font>

318
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,978
sell that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can point against free IP</font>

319
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,748
and authenticate but if you're looking

320
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:02,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get the bells and whistles and policy</font>

321
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:04,569
applied and things like that then you're

322
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,108
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little bit more limited</font>

323
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:11,569
again basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your your rel</font>

324
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:14,629

325
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:16,988
with sssd are going to be able to

326
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:24,649
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you those that policy management</font>

327
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:26,809
on a per<font color="#CCCCCC"> hose basis so some of the</font>

328
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:29,599
policy features this gets pretty in

329
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:32,959
depth here we can do essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font>

330
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:38,540
pseudo rules selinux context host based

access control is Otto Otto

332
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,699
automatically add hosts and users to two

333
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,040
groups so you can start automatically

334
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:51,660
applying policy once a once a user or a

335
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,730
host is connected to two free IPA I like

336
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,390
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story you know specifically</font>

337
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:00,320
when in the real world we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

338
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:04,050
called satellite right and satellite 6

339
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,880
free IPA or IDM plugs into that and when

340
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you start provisioning systems using</font>

341
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,310
satellite it'll automatically add the

342
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,149
hosts entry into it'll automatically add

343
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:17,459
the host into free IPA and once that

344
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,050
host is added based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some regex that</font>

345
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:21,149
you apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your auto membership rules</font>

346
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:25,079
it'll automatically add that host to a

347
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:27,180
host group now that host immediately out

348
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:31,319
of the box as soon as this provision has

349
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,839
policy applied to it right so that that

350
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,870
helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigate those gaps in time when</font>

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,089
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> provisioning and policy</font>

352
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,180
application right it's it's applied at

353
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:44,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time of provisioning so those types</font>

354
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,829
of those types of automated process and

355
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:51,410
automated workflow really helps out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

356
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:53,969
in the the enterprise world and again

357
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,980
tying this back into identity management

358
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,610
right you're managing the identity of

359
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,930
that server that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just set up so</font>

360
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:05,520
again out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box we want to make</font>

361
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:08,129
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's as policies as applied as</font>

362
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,929
possible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that host without the gap in</font>

363
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:15,240
time so and you know some additional

364
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:17,309
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is two different POSIX data sets</font>

365
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:22,699
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do centrally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> managed SSH keys</font>

366
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:25,918
for your users you know auto mounts

367
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:28,679
things like that it's fairly it's fairly

368
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,510
robust and all of this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps ease</font>

369
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,250
your administrative overhead in your

370
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,129
Linux environment because now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

371
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,200
managing these policies on a per host

372
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,330
basis you're managing them in one

373
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,340
central location and you're managing

374
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,620
them hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a host level not on a</font>

375
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,360
per-user<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean on a group level not on</font>

376
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,489
a per user level to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your</font>

377
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,379
administrative headache even less right

378
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,180
so now you don't when somebody leaves

379
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,400
you don't have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> across your entire</font>

380
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,400
data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say well did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was this</font>

381
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,120
user in my suitors file was the dis user

382
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,250
have you know automount rules set up on

383
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,139
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> box you just go right in here</font>

384
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">delete the user and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> automatically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled</font>

385
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of the groups and you don't have to</font>

386
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:11,460
worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that policy anymore so we</font>

387
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,000
can also manage two factor

388
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:20,040
authentication and smart cards so free

389
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">IPA can manage neh OTP or totp token or</font>

390
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:29,040
soft tokens<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personally use I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

391
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:33,660
ubc for that has the pivot and pivot

392
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:36,510
Iran at PGP and OTP but you can use

393
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,090
pretty much any<font color="#CCCCCC"> h.o.t p or t to be token</font>

394
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,879
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a soft token again like</font>

395
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:45,209
free OTP on your smartphone or Google

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,540
Authenticator or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

397
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,820
if you already have say RSA securid set

398
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:56,340
up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your environment you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can configure</font>

400
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,020

securid server as part of that as part

403
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,430
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> users authentication process so</font>

404
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">you as long as it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be set up as a</font>

405
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:16,950
radius as a radius server you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can bring</font>

406
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:20,400
your own OTP solution so and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

407
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,620
smart cards we can't provision smart

408
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,680
cards yet with free IPA though that is

409
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,209
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> road map but if you already have</font>

410
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,770
smart cards that you're using you can

411
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,770
pull the user certificate off of the

412
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:36,030
smart card put the put the binary

413
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,100
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the users users entry</font>

414
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,990
in the ldap database and now you can

415
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:45,199
start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certificate verification</font>

416
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:49,290
against that that's strictly binary and

417
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,190
that's done either by sssd or<font color="#E5E5E5"> pam module</font>

421
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:09,210
questions any questions

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">no okay all right so you know it</font>

424
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:21,660
strongly recommended I would personally

425
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:24,059
require it if I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> because in the</font>

426
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,870
free IPA runs primarily on Kerberos and

427
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">pin pki and there are two things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

428
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:36,689
Kerberos and PKA are is critical for

429
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:39,480
that to function time and name right so

430
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,419
if you're controlling your own DNS then

431
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,669
you are slightly more assured that your

432
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,720
fqdn<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you have said are pointing</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to function</font>

436
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:57,689
appropriately and we do have built<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

437
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,419
DNS SEC support this was tech preview

438
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,700
when it was released in rel 72 as part

439
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,980
of the rel platform but but it is in

440
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:11,130
free IPA and should be out of tech

441
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:13,410
preview by<font color="#E5E5E5"> 73 so and the disadvantage</font>

442
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,630
here is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to delegate a zone for</font>

443
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:18,120
now again we're working on that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

444
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,549
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by delegated zone let's say you</font>

445
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,989
have your your DNS infrastructure setup

446
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,480
today in your Active Directory

447
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,110
environment and your realm is you know

448
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,860
or your DNS zone is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> deed example calm</font>

449
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:34,500
right you can't add free I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pa-28 example</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">calm it has to be Linux example calm or</font>

452
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:49,860
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> add it to that zone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

453
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:51,390
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA related functionality this is</font>

454
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,870
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wheel houses I love talking</font>

00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">about pki because I'm a bit of a nerd</font>

456
00:21:53,870 --> 00:22:01,168
but certificate provisioning for users

457
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:04,290
so you can with a with free IPA you can

458
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:06,210
you can issue certificates for users for

459
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:11,159
services so your ssl certs you can do

460
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:14,300
host-based certificates in free IPA for

461
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">they goes free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipf the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

462
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,580
for you can you can now manage custom

463
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,030
certificate profiles so if you have a

464
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,710
specific use case that you're issuing

465
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,450
certificates for you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

466
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,700
custom certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> profiles so you can</font>

467
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,620
manage the life cycle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificate</font>

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:39,760
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so you can really make it what</font>

471
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,380
you need it to be in your environment

472
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,580
there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can deploy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free IPA and a</font>

473
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple different ways with the CA you</font>

474
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,260
can either do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can either choose to</font>

475
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,659
not implement a CA if you don't want to

476
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:54,320
you can be a subordinate of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing</font>

477
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,990
group CA so you can sign you can you can

478
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,639
have the ca that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> free IPA provides be</font>

479
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,070
a subordinate of your bridge CA so it's

480
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,680
part of that trust chain or it can be

481
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,840
its own self sign CA you know those are

482
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,780
your three options and we make it pretty

483
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,520
easy to switch between you know if you

484
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,770
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with no CA and then like well</font>

485
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,840
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be a self-signed CA it's</font>

486
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,400
pretty easy to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self-signed CA</font>

487
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,899
and then if you need if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font>

488
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,480
it a subordinate you can change that as

489
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,590
well midstream without having to

490
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,540
reinstall and it also comes with a

491
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,870
security archival<font color="#E5E5E5"> and recovery we call</font>

492
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,659
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ball it's based off of our KRA</font>

493
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">from dog tag so that's where you're</font>

494
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:38,630
keeping cryptographically<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap secrets</font>

495
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:41,750
so you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store user private</font>

496
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:47,990
keys you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store passwords</font>

497
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:49,790
you know anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that so requisite</font>

meme your pikia is bad and you should

500
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,190
historically has been hard most people

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard time implementing it we're</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying hard to make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

503
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,730
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement good pki so if it's</font>

504
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,920
something you've played with<font color="#E5E5E5"> before in</font>

505
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,130
the past and and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think wanna</font>

506
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,320
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should all</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing and encrypting emails we</font>

should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it just we should all</font>

509
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,850
right and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's worth it's worth</font>

510
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,800
taking a look at again because

511
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,590
technology has advanced and it's getting

512
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement and I'm happy</font>

513
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,639
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any questions you know offline</font>

514
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,470
about PK

515
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,760
if anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really super curious so I</font>

516
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,030
figured I'd have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

517
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,240
and I do to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little stroll through</font>

518
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,440
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> webui because again most</font>

519
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,630
people they're going to spend most of

520
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,180
their time in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web UI not a lot of</font>

521
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">time in the CLI but I do get into that a</font>

522
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,890
little bit in a few but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

523
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,139
some quick screenshots of what the UI

524
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,630
looks like and some of the tabbing here

525
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,370
right so as you can see we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can manage</font>

526
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,240
identity policy authentication

that auto member before where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

533
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:22,690
set up rules and policies where if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i add</font>

a user with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain certain structure</font>

certain naming conventions or four

groups certain naming conventions we can

538
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,200
set auto member policies to say well if

539
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,270
a user gets added with this certain in

540
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,250
these certain groups or in the with this

541
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,410
certain pattern we can automatically

542
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,240
apply policy to that user based on that

543
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,270
auto membership rule same thing with

544
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,370
hosts and it's all it's all based on

545
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,230
just simple regex you know just throw

546

bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more context here so for policy</font>

551
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,860
you've got your host based access

552
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,560
controls here we're saying you know

553
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:15,280
these users can only access these

554
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,139
systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to give the example</font>

555
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,970
of and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to excuse me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

556
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use jazz hands whenever I say this</font>

557
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:24,460
word so the DevOps gaps in the DevOps

558
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,050
world right let's say you have you know

559
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,880
five developers who during rapid

560
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:30,730
development and deployment on these

561
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,370
servers and you know they need to be

562
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,790
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know quickly deploy test</font>

563
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,489
troubleshoot

564
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">ode so we're going to set up these five</font>

565
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:44,180
users in a group that's like you know

566
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,620
this project<font color="#CCCCCC"> ash dev group right and /</font>

567
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,150
that group we're going to start applying

568
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,570
policies we're going to start applying

569
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,370
your host based access control rules so

570
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:55,340
anybody in this group can only access

571
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:57,080
these you know these five developments

572
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain these five development servers</font>

573
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,490
and then you're going to do centrally

574
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">manage pseudo rules here where anybody</font>

575
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:08,600
in this dev group can only run these

576
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,240
commands on these five servers so now if

577
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,699
those developers try and log<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this</font>

578
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,580
production this production web server

579
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,900
and try a they won't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to because</font>

580
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,520
they're going to be explicitly denied

581
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:24,650
based on host based access control rules

582
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,480
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> B that's it right so when they do</font>

583
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,250
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development servers they're</font>

584
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,830
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say well you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

585
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,080
install this other package well because

586
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,879
when you've done your student you've set

587
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,220
up your pseudo rules correctly they're

588
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,840
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to run yum because</font>

589
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,030
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be able to sudo yum</font>

590
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,149
install whatever they're only going to

591
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,670
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sudo service you know I want</font>

592
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,710
to restart tomcat<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowland we're going to</font>

593
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,740
explicitly provide them the ability to

594
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:54,410
restart tomcat and that's it and also

595
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,420
based on based on group membership we

596
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,490
can start applying auto mount policies

597
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,770
where you know on these five servers

598
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,140
these developers are going to

599
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,270
automatically have their their code

600
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,800
directories mounted into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this</font>

601
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,600
server so they can have access to their

602
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,820
code and their documentation and things

603
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,830
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now you can start seeing</font>

604
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">how policy is starting to come together</font>

605
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:21,199
and tell a story about what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> user can</font>

606
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,910
and cannot do why where they can go you

607
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,280
know so again we have the who and what

608
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have the services the hosts and the</font>

609
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:32,540
users now we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the why the wind the</font>

610
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:33,770
where right so again you know for the

611
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">hood for the host based access control</font>

612
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,570
rules we can do it based on you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

613
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,750
host itself we could do it based on

614
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,899
services so any any host that's running

615
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:46,190
these services this user can access and

616
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,710
service groups

617
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,539
so again you know if you have developers

618
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:54,950
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on lamp stacks right you</font>

619
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:57,769
can add your your Apache service<font color="#E5E5E5"> your my</font>

620
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,320
sequel service and your PHP service to a

621
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,909
service group and any host that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

622
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,779
this service group that user can access

623
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:08,269
right so now you're even make it easier

624
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:11,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">to control and easier to provide access</font>

625
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:13,940
to what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just actually need and</font>

626
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:15,320
pseudo rules you're setting up the rule

627
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,789
itself you're setting up what commands

628
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,759
they can use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also set up</font>

629
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:21,740
command groups so you know again if a

630
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,240
group of developers needs to need to

631
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,889
have access to a group of commands<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

632
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">can set up a command group that way</font>

633
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:30,350
you're not giving you know one command

634
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:32,509
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on an ad hoc basis</font>

635
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:36,408
right you're just applying one group of

636
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:38,480
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the user so any question any</font>

637
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:41,750
questions I know this is a lot of

638
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,549
information is it can be pretty dense

639
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:55,279
and I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as interesting</font>

640
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:57,379
as possible sir that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question</font>

641
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,259
and I'm actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that so</font>

642
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:03,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was does the server reach</font>

643
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:07,669
out to ldap to check and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what the</font>

644
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:10,399
pseudo rules are or does the ldap server

645
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:13,399
push pseudo rules down to the host the

646
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,149
answer is when the user authenticates

647
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:19,189
sssd is going to if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> sssd</font>

648
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:22,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">configured to manage pseudo rules</font>

649
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:26,149
locally it will query ldap and apply

650
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:29,178
those pseudo rules for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> session for</font>

651
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:32,059
that user so it's going to override<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

652
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:34,429
local pseudo policy and apply those

653
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:37,100
policies based on whatever ldap has so

654
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:41,210
it's on a per it's on a per session

655
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:47,059
basis so and it pulls it from from ldap

656
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:49,250
at authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> time yeah anytime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

657
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so authentication mechanisms you</font>

658
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,230
know here we've got your tickets your

659
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,399
OTP tokens and your radius servers you

660
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,769
know again I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little</font>

661
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you would set</font>

662
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:02,170
up you know

663
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,670
you would you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you know grab</font>

664
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:06,900
your certificates you know manage your

665
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:10,510
certificate profiles and your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA</font>

666
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:13,080
access control lists your you can

667
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,520
configure and manage your OTP tokens

668
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,899
managing OTP tokens is actually really

669
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,540
nice because you can set it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in a</font>

670
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:25,180
self-service kind of way where users can

671
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:27,310
go to a particular self-service screen

672
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">at self-service portal where they have</font>

673
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,820
their information and they'll get a QR

674
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:35,110
code so if they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use Google</font>

675
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:37,120
Authenticator or frio<font color="#E5E5E5"> tpd you know soft</font>

676
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,949
token on their phone they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to that</font>

677
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,810
self-service site and say well I want to

678
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,810
register this new OTP token and

679
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,669
registered so that takes a little bit of

680
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:48,940
the administrative overhead off of off

681
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:52,270
of your administrators allows for better

682
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,500
BYOD type situations but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again that's</font>

683
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,850
going to be up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you whether or not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

684
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to allow that that's all</font>

685
00:31:54,850 --> 00:32:06,629
configurable you can didn't you can not

686
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:09,939
allow that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't want to sir sure</font>

687
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,740
yep yeah so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was being able</font>

688
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to set up TOTP heart like hardware-based</font>

689
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:19,780
tokens absolutely you know again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

690
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:25,750
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I use the here we go I use this</font>

691
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:30,790
see you be key for its<font color="#CCCCCC"> TOTP yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

692
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">HLT p token so and i have it set up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

693
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:39,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">my free a free IPA server at home so all</font>

694
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,760
right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again this is where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

695
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,820
go to manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> those manage your your OTP</font>

696
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,010
tokens what's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that as well as</font>

697
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,530
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can delegate administrative control</font>

698
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,940
you can say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up</font>

699
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,770
administrators as you know this person

700
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,480
is the owner of this token this person's

701
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,850
the user of this token or this<font color="#CCCCCC"> person is</font>

702
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,650
the the administrator of this token

703
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,139
right so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to limit what</font>

704
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,470
those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually do with debts</font>

705
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,470
open

706
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,430
so network services you can start

707
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,400
setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your auto mount locations</font>

708
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:18,700
here so you can start you know providing

709
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:23,230
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto mount locations to to user</font>

710
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:26,110
groups host groups etc and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS you</font>

711
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,730
can set up you know your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS zones</font>

712
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,620
you could have multiple DNS zones you

713
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">can have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can set up your reverse</font>

714
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:35,350
lookups here you know those types of

715
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,510
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it supports all the</font>

716
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,459
standard DNS records so your SRB records

717
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:47,140
your txt records you know those types of

718
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:50,410
things so and managing the IPA server

719
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,870
itself again role-based access control

720
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,910
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your free IPA administrators</font>

721
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,620
so you can start locking down what your

722
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,620
administrators can do whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you</font>

723
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,929
want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to provision users</font>

724
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,840
provision you know policy what could

725
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,490
policy they can provision you know so

726
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,040
you're not just handing the keys to the

727
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:11,050
kingdom to somebody and say I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

728
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,880
to just manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> pseudo rules but you can</font>

729
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,950
manage everything else as well but stay

730
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,080
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your box right we all know that</font>

731
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:23,169
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't stay in their box if given</font>

732
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:25,420
the given the option so ID ranges you

733
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:29,110
know you can you can custom set your

734
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:32,380
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iid ranges so if you want one free</font>

735
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:35,200
IPA server to issue you know you IDs and

736
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,610
G IDs from 1 million to two million you

737
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">can set that here and the other one will</font>

738
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">be from three million 24 million right</font>

739
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,139
that way you know it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little</font>

740
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit a little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

741
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:46,060
administrative control to figure out

742
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,690
okay well you know this UID was it was

743
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:53,610
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 1,100,000 we know which free</font>

744
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:58,720
IPA server issued that credential right

745
00:34:53,610 --> 00:35:03,910
based on that I derange so other things

746
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">ID views realm domain so ID views if you</font>

747
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,020
are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> free IPA in an active</font>

directory trust type situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

749
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,910
to get into trust here in a second you

750
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,539
can you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> override certain attributes</font>

751
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:21,078
that active directory will send down to

752
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:23,029
free IPA using ID views but I've got

753
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,609
about 15 minutes left so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

754
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">on to actually talk a little bit about</font>

755
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:32,269
active directory I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Active Directory</font>

756
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,890

757
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:35,269
examples of the command line interface

758
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,180
you know it's pretty it's pretty

759
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:40,609
self-explanatory so you know if I want

760
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,919
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything that's a user user ID</font>

761

764
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:52,969
have group you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again it's pretty</font>

765
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,440
pretty self-explanatory you know and

766
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:56,599
again if I wanted to you know

767
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,729
programmatically add<font color="#CCCCCC"> pseudo rules or</font>

768
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:59,989
pseudo groups and anything like that you

769
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:02,569
can do it from the command line here

770
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:08,119
just by passing at the the option and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

771
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:09,739
couple arguments so sssd talked about

772
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,210
this a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

777
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,759
configure whether or not you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

780
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:31,368
to configure that in your SSS the

781
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,859
configuration file and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take over</font>

784
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:45,489
was is there a puppet module available

785
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:49,009
for free IPA I would bet you<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

786
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:52,519
you mean to provision the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provision</font>

787
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:55,279
pre IPA yeah I'll bet you there is I

788
00:36:52,519 --> 00:37:00,200
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've seen I've seen quite a</font>

789
00:36:55,279 --> 00:37:02,299
bit work done with ansible but I i would

790
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,368
bet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would I'd be surprised if</font>

791
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:09,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">there wasn't I'm just not personally</font>

792
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:11,479
aware of one so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use sssd to</font>

793
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:14,118
authenticate you know to set up to

794
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,919
authenticate just about anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSST</font>

795
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,690
can be set up to do a direct trust

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,719
relationship direct authentication to

797
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:24,319

<font color="#E5E5E5">bypassing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pre IPA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> altogether or really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just about any other kind of identity</font>

800
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,540
provider and what's nice here is you can

801
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,580
set up multiple

802
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,390
identity providers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one sssd</font>

803
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:40,480
configuration file so if you have users

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:44,140
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Centrify and some users in you know</font>

806
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,700
some openldap database somewhere you can

807
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,890
set those all those sources up in one

808
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,240
sssd file and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't find the</font>

811
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,359
on to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third one if it doesn't find</font>

812
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">them there it'll fail obviously but you</font>

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,780
know it allows you to provide multiple

814
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,360
sources if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

815
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,100
required in your environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it also</font>

816
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,140
provides credential caching you know for

817
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,080
a mobile workforce or for maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> a data</font>

818
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,359
center that has connectivity issues

819
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,630
where you may lose connection back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

820
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,310
home base you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to time so</font>

821
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll cash credentials you can configure</font>

822
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,850
it to whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to cash</font>

823
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:28,220
credentials and for how long you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it</font>

824
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:30,500
to cash credentials so so a little bit

825
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,450
about the Active Directory Integration

826
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,770
you're setting up a cross<font color="#E5E5E5"> forest trust</font>

827
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:38,330
between free IPA and Active Directory

828
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,460
this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to do is it's</font>

829
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:43,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use active directory as your</font>

830
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,990
authoritative source of identity so all

831
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,150
your users and groups are going to be

832
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,490
still managed and configured up in

833
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:52,250
active directory and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to map</font>

834
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,569
those groups locally and free IPA and

835
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,210
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to apply policy based on</font>

836
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,610
group membership so what happens is when

837
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,830
sssd says hey free IPA do you have this

838
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,810
user free IPAs going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> nah man but</font>

839
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,400
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ask Active Directory active</font>

840
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,570
directory is going to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes and he's</font>

841
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send what's called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pack</font>

842
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,660
back and the pack is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

843
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:13,580
contains all your user information and

844
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,310
what we are most concerned about here is

845
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,319
what groups you're a member of and again

846
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,600
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to map the groups that you</font>

847
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,920
want here locally in free IPA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> based</font>

848
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,779
on that group membership we're going to

849
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,780
start applying the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux specific policy</font>

850
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,649
so any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this and what's</font>

851
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,410
what's nice here is if you're if you're

852
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:36,110
in a primarily window shop and you've

853
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,609
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a good solution for</font>

854
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:40,130
authenticating against active directory

855
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,480
for a while this helps you speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

856
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,390
same language that your Active Directory

857
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,700
administrator

858
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,950
speak because setting up your your cross

859
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,569
forest trust here is essentially the

860
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">same way you would set up across forest</font>

861
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:51,779
trust from Active Directory to active

862
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,519
directory so you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

863
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:55,829
language or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're able to use</font>

864
00:39:53,519 --> 00:40:02,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same vernacular right so it should</font>

865
00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:04,019
help ease that conversation so one last

866
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:07,289
little piece of this puzzle is realm d

867
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,819
realm<font color="#CCCCCC"> d is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the service that's actually</font>

868
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:11,119
used remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

869
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:16,710
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do an IPA client install</font>

870
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:19,470
it will do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns search to check if</font>

871
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,109
there are any existing realms out there

872
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:25,589
that you can join it uses realm d to do

873
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:28,410
this the several<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use realm</font>

874
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:30,599
the command line d bus interface through

875
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:34,200
a system installer or from a desktop

876
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,920
application really simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's similar</font>

877
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,500
to what many folks are used to using

878
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,210
when trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do Active Directory</font>

879
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,670
Integration you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

880
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to join leave you know those types of</font>

881
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:53,190
things for the realm but that's what's

882
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,299
used to join these systems so just a

883
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:00,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more about Active Directory</font>

884
00:40:54,299 --> 00:41:02,430
Integration so as you can tell we're

885
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:06,089
either going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use ldap or Kerberos for</font>

886
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:08,129
our authentication to active directory

887
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,750
which is going to be proxy through free

888
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,480
IPA the identities are going to be

889
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:15,180
provided by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Active Directory ldap</font>

890
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:23,099
database but all the policy is going to

891
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:27,960
be provided by free IPA so a little bit

892
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:30,450
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sssd based integration so it</font>

893
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,490
buys you the same the same thing right

894
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:36,509
you know active directory is maintained

895
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:39,029
as your sole source of identity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

896
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:40,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy right so</font>

897
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,150
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you're not managing users and</font>

898
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,589
groups locally anymore but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also</font>

899
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:48,710
don't get those additional bells and

900
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:48,710
whistles that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> applied by free IPA</font>

901
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,150
and here's some pretty pictures it shows

902
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:57,549
you you know what what service<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

903
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,500
mapped what services in pre<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPAs pretty</font>

904
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:01,900
it's pretty self-explanatory so you have

905
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:05,230
your see a chain you have your delegated

906
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,680
DNS zones you've got your cross forest

907
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:10,960
trust between KDC and KDC and now here's

908
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">how it all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works together a bit of a</font>

909
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,780
spaghetti graph but it does a decent job

910
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,730
of showing you how it all works together

911
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">and again you know it shows you what's</font>

912
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:23,740
provided by was provided by free IPA and

913
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:32,259
what's provided by you know your Active

914
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:37,569
Directory sir oh so that last slide was

915
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:40,510
just sssd sssd direct integration with

916
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,160
with active directory this is free this

917
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,230
is free i piayed active directory I

918
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:55,089
apologize if that wasn't if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't</font>

919
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:57,700
super clear so this one yeah this is

920
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:59,140
this is direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> integration to sss the</font>

921
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:03,609
base direct integration to active

922
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:07,240
directory where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm at now is active is</font>

923
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:08,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">sssd to ID to free IPA to active</font>

924
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,220
directory so this is this is what we

925
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:14,230
call in direct integration so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

926
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think a slide got dropped out of here</font>

927
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,870
because it should have been more clear

928
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:22,180
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in that distinction so I Apollo</font>

929
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:24,190
apologized but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah no cross forest</font>

930
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:30,970
trust is certainly supported from free

931
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:34,240
IPA to active directory so yeah some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

932
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:37,270
the pros you know no synchronization

933
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,549
required previously the way to integrate

934
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:43,180
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> active directory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was through user</font>

935
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:45,370
and password synchronization not a great

936
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:50,049
solution right a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

937
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:52,569
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that understandably so so</font>

938
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,190
but the requirement proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS set up</font>

939
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,530
right you know again we're back to

940
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,830
ensuring that DNS and your time

941
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:01,570
synchronization is accurate so some user

942
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,600
mapping information

943
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:08,140
you can leverage your SF you IMU for

944
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:10,390
posix you can do dynamic mapping of SIDS

945
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,509
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> GI DS this is done at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sss d</font>

946
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:17,770
level and you can do static overrides

947
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:19,240
with ID views so you know again for

948
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:22,330
example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do static overrides for</font>

949
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:31,620
ssh keys things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that through ID</font>

950
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:33,970
views<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright and so to a one-way trusts</font>

951
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,310
you know some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

952
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:39,609
on as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as some some better samba</font>

953
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:43,870
integration with free IPA to be a more

954
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:45,760
robust domain controller and you know

955
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:49,359
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also migrate if you're currently</font>

956
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:54,280
using a sink type topology you can

957
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:56,350
migrate to a trust pretty easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a</font>

958
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,240
little bit about another thing that is

959
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:59,830
provided out there that's really nice

960
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,319
when you're talking about identities is

961
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,240
federated identity how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

962
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">are familiar with federated identity the</font>

963
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,100
concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> of federated identity a couple</font>

964
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">hands that's nice so there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

965
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,549
projects out there called epsilon and

966
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:20,410
key cloak they're there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help provide</font>

967
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:22,330
sam'l open ID connect Oh off type

968
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,250
federated identity services right this

969
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:28,060
is this is your bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own IDP your</font>

970
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:29,620
own identity provider you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

971
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,299
of helpful it's really helpful in the

972
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,770
web services world so you don't have to

973
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,210
manage your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own information store you</font>

974
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,770
can just say hey you can go ahead and

975
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,430
authenticate using your Facebook

976
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:42,040
credentials right if you're okay with

977
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but what's really nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well is</font>

978
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,480
you know internally you know doing

979
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:50,680
service to service authentication right

980
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,130
you you want to be able to limit the

981
00:45:50,680 --> 00:46:01,240
amount of identities people need to have

982
00:45:53,130 --> 00:46:02,770
right so so a couple interesting and

983
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,330
upcoming things one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

984
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:08,110
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention because it's super</font>

985
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:11,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool called clevis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tang it is is</font>

986
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:14,350
asynchronous secret sharing based on

987
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,190
environment data so the you

988
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:21,460
case that started this whole project was

989
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:22,930
Lux<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lux hold this concretion right let's</font>

990
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,400
say you have data center with a thousand

991
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,220
servers and you want to encrypt all

992
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,870
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks using lux now you have to</font>

993
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">think of well if I have a power outage</font>

994
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,799
now I got to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and hand enter a</font>

995
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:35,620
password into a thousand servers ain't

996
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,570
nobody got time for that right so so

997
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:42,460
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> does is it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service that</font>

998
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:44,680
runs and if you're on a specific for

999
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:48,340
example as long as the server is on a

1000
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,319
specific subnet and has another specific

1001
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,300
environment variable that you can

1002
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,210
control to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's where it is</font>

1003
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,670
where it should be it'll send<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests</font>

1004
00:46:55,210 --> 00:47:01,590
to your cleveson<font color="#CCCCCC"> tang as a client-server</font>

1005
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:04,690
relationship the host will send a

1006
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:06,160
request back to clevis and say hey you

1007
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,390
know I'm here's my environmental

1008
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,100
variables you know can i unlock my<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk</font>

1009
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:14,080
the server will send back well yeah but

1010
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,390
send me your<font color="#E5E5E5"> private key send me your</font>

1011
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,940
key then they'll do a key exchange and

1012
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:21,220
if all of that works well you can

1013
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,860
cryptographically you know use key-based

1014
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,740
decryption for your looks your Luck's

1015
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:29,440
disks it's still very early on but a

1016
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,240
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting concept again this</font>

1017
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,010
ties into identity because we need to

1018
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,229
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the identity of that server where</font>

1019
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,180
it should be who it should be what it

1020
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:41,860
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to be able to decrypt this</font>

1021
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:43,569
disc right so so really super

1022
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,520
interesting and out if it's something

1023
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's interesting to you i would highly</font>

1024
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,300
recommend checking it out i have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

1025
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,850
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a blog post about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the</font>

1026
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,690
deck but talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know</font>

1027
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:57,460
unix-based you know policy management

1028
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:00,730
there are modules out there Pam modules

1029
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,920
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> new one called Pam HVAC that</font>

1030
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:05,440
you can use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your solar systems that</font>

1031
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,590
can allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide the host based</font>

1032
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,080
access control policy management for

1033
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,580
your unix systems through IPA it's

1034
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,009
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not supported yet it's</font>

1035
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,720
fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> new but again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something to take a</font>

1036
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,250
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at if you have a non-homogeneous</font>

1037
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,919
environment and you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and</font>

1038
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,680
use this for your your unix type

1039
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,930
infrastructure same thing with tam sudo

1040
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,180
so why is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so important you know as</font>

1041
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,460
I've said you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1042
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:33,450
no we already know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and who</font>

1043
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:36,329
we have now we need to know why we have

1044
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:38,759
it why these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can access what they</font>

1045
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:41,609
can access<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you know where can they</font>

1046
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,260
access it when can<font color="#E5E5E5"> they access it all of</font>

1047
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:44,759
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of identity management</font>

1048
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,510
right all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is part of your</font>

1049
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity solution and you need to have a</font>

1050
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,069
good robust infrastructure for identity

1051
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,380
management to have that insight into

1052
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:58,170
your environment by the way auditors

1053
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,390
love it if you can give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report</font>

1054
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,640
that says this user can access these

1055
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,589
here's why and here's how we

1056
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,259
specifically deny them access to

1057
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else right and a solution</font>

1058
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free IPA puts all that information</font>

1059
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:17,609
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there at your fingertips to to to</font>

1060
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,649
leverage and we all need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the sexy</font>

1061
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:21,058
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> identity management everybody</font>

1062
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,710
kind of glazes over when you start

1063
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,599
talking about identity management but

1064
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,700
there's so much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it so much more</font>

1065
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,140
complexity and it really starts getting

1066
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,689
interesting right because it starts

1067
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,129
solving business problems and we all

1068
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:34,890
need to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of solving business</font>

1069
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:37,380
problems right even your basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-level</font>

1070
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,000
systems administrator we're all security

1071
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,859
professionals we all should be security

1072
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,710
professionals and this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion is</font>

1073
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:45,299
a huge part of security right is

1074
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,030
understanding the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoos of what's the</font>

1075
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:51,270
wind so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where's the wise in the house</font>

1076
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:54,390
and now that I'm wrapping up here's

1077
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:56,970
where you can find me on Twitter at DISA

1080
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:05,730
freenode and free IPA and dog tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki</font>

1081
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,819
and the slides will be available but you

1082

know here's some links to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

1083
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:13,589
there is a live demo on free IPA org

1084
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,160
where you can go and click around the

1085
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:19,140
interface and and kind of kick the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tires</font>
