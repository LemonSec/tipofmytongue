we we'd solved what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i came on to do and</font>

56
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,250
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for something I</font>

shouldn't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing we opted for me to</font>

I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it so</font>

61
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,200
what I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last 90 days is</font>

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,489
running circles doing a lot of other

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">things this keynote and this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation I hope to have with you</font>

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,700
this morning is time to reflect back on

66
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,930
a little bit not just for my career but

67
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,358
things have been focusing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on while</font>

68
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,850
studying between these two gigs and

69
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,350
preparing for my next role hopefully

70
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,910
there will be something here all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

71
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">can walk away with and i'll try not to</font>

72
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:46,190
geek out too much on aviation stuff is

73
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fair it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so flight lessons</font>

74
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,840
you know how to spot a crossfitter or a

75
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,970
vegan or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PhD or a pilot right it just</font>

77
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,670
going to be that guy this morning so

78
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,859
when you guys fly anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a fear of</font>

79
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,339
flight and there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with</font>

80
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:07,500
that one day i love you for that so

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,609
flying is for me something I live for

82
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,900
it's in my blood<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is probably</font>

83
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,299
the wrong time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into story about</font>

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,340
why I got into flight but very simply

85
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,489
it's my dad's first love I learned to

86
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,258
fly to get to know my

87
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,388
man better he used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

88
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:25,240
authoritarian he was my dad he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

89
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,680
how to do things learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changed</font>

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

91
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,979
relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> between parents and</font>

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,620
children be go be going somewhere from

93
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,120
you don't tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do to your my</font>

94
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,000
peer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confidant you're my</font>

95
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,889
friend we share things and doing that

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,150
has been amazing for me so I got into

97
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:45,069
flight learn to fly and I actually think

98
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,929
Jeremiah Grossman for pushing me out of

99
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,470
the nest and to start flying but that's

100
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,370
again a longer story for another time a

101
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,380
lot of folks want to know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

102
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,630
wanting to transition into full-time

103
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:01,180
aviation and the cancer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course is yes</font>

104
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:04,750
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm good at math you see it costs</font>

105
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,180
about $250,000 us to get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

106
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,550
flight training to get from basic visual

107
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,740
flight instrument commercial to get your

108
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,560
air transport the twin engines and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Jets $250,000 to get all the experience</font>

110
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,759
just to clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> the baseline minimum for</font>

111
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:22,150
insurance standards to start flying for

112
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,770
an airline and your reward for that down

113
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,770
payment my friends is 22 grand a year

114
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,150
poignant moment to pause reflecting on

115
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,610
the Senators remarks yesterday morning I

116
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,239
tune from Texas I was on the same flight

117
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,979
out from Austin with windy but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

118
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell you you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need a degree to</font>

119
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:45,400
do security what you do need is humility

120
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,490
what you do need is curiosity what you

121
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,590
do need is a dash of initiative but what

122
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,259
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a whole lot of is critical</font>

123
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,729
thinking so we're going to tear parts of

124
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,729
this apart but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain focus</font>

125
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,639
on priorities margin and fatigue through

126
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,729
this so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of flying I do</font>

127
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,159
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call this VFR visual flight</font>

128
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,960
regulations visual meaning you have to

129
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">see maintain visual separation from</font>

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,460
other planes if any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever driven</font>

131
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,469
your car in a dense fog or<font color="#CCCCCC"> into smoke</font>

132
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,030
now they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you driving this</font>

133
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:18,460
boat pull over turn on your hazards in

134
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait right because you know smoke just</font>

135
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,090
disappears quickly

136
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,860
in aviation you have to have a special

137
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">endorsement to fly into conditions where</font>

138
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't see clearly so that looks more</font>

139
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:32,969
like this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a dashboard and</font>

140
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,590
you're socked in so you're literally

141
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,419
flying in the clouds they call it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

142
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,750
soup this is what they call IFR

more peril as I find between aviation

and information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security they say to</font>

we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about is looking at these</font>

151
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,050
instruments and realizing sometimes

152
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,849
you're getting a false indication you've

you're looking at and you learn nothing

155
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,940
is what it seems you learn and we talked

156
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,888
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yesterday Ben gave a great</font>

your dashboard in this radio going crazy

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,409
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the approach lights you</font>

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> let me compare the differences here</font>

175
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,729
you know the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between a good</font>

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,409
get worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you're flying right</font>

182
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,240
there's critical speeds their stall

183
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:14,099
speeds there's maneuvering speeds

184

there's all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information you're</font>

processing they say that speed is life

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,659

enough speed enough air across the wings

190
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,380
we maintain lift the plane keeps flying

191
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,880
we all worry what happens if the engine

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,240
goes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the difference between</font>

that airplane the others a glider speed

is life if you don't maintain critical

creating lift stall means you're no

longer an airplane you're on your way to

200
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:55,569
becoming a lawn dart that's bad to

201
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,880
process this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand pilots are</font>

203
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:09,070
stupid crazy yes I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

204
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,420
that flight instructors are crazier than

205
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,740
we are as a student pilot<font color="#CCCCCC"> full time what</font>

206
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,010
I'm doing is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill my</font>

207
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,690
instructor think about it for a minute

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,339
if I screw something up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,089
instructors not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of his game what</font>

210
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:27,850
happens we're lawn darts that's right

211
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,230
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple equation so when I</font>

212
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,640
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk management I think a</font>

213
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,279
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we do with security</font>

214
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,500
professionals we're actually not the

215
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,980
pilots most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us don't run our</font>

216
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,470
companies we do inform we do coach we do

217
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,329
try to protect we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid this lawn</font>

dart scenario but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day</font>

219
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,839
we're strapped in we're along for the

220
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,339
ride and frankly the FAA is going to

221
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,589
blame anything I do is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> student on the</font>

222
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,149
instructor whatever happens we're going

223
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,760
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> left holding the bag so we've got</font>

224
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:58,029
to be thinking this through any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

225
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:03,060
teaching people children to<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive some</font>

226
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:05,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you oh my goodness is that scary and</font>

227
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,760
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking like you're on the ground</font>

228
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get the brakes and you're sitting</font>

229
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,980
still like there's no lawn dart

230
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:16,630
consideration you just get honked at and

231
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,880
flustered who we're talking a whole

232
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,470
different level of confusion so when you

233
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,060
start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this we have to</font>

234
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,209
break down how we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to teach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

235
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,800
apart all these principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

236
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,199
isn't just teaching a student to learn

237
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,740
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fly a plane we want to become pilots</font>

238
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,560
I challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that the instructors are</font>

239
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,540
actually doing a greater thing they're

240
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,449
teaching us not just to fly and pass a

241
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,250
test but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to survive and fly afterwards</font>

242
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,680
as successful pilots they're creating

243
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,860
students for life they're empowering and

244
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,000
in fostering this curiosity

245
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,320
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue this training</font>

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,910
we've got to continue this education

247
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,290
things will start to slip so we're going

248
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,079
to break these things down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

249
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,060
of areas so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about please tell</font>

250
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">me this is still functional we're going</font>

251
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about priorities first</font>

252
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,100
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> aviation is prioritization in</font>

253
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,449
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've learned and it's</font>

254
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really funny because I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had to dog</font>

255
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:17,850
food myself any of you between jobs

256
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:20,200
right now you all are employed right on

257
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,940
they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's zero percent</font>

258
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,990
unemployment in this industry as someone

259
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,220
seen a hand in here so as since I'm the

260
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,480
only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in employed in this room let me</font>

261
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,480
tell you what it's like being unemployed

262
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,569
you're busier than you are when you have

263
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,720
a full-time job because everybody talks

264
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be one offer you a job so</font>

265
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,110
here's looking your best you're falling

266
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,149
up with everybody you're doing your

267

research oh my goodness you're busy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

268
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,390
the funny thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that is there's</font>

269
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,370
the stuff that you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and let</font>

270
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,350
me tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you my wife has a very thorough</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and proper and carefully prioritized</font>

272
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,730
list of things to do on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that honey do</font>

273
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,760
list before I start back to work oh dear

274
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:05,500
I've accomplished nothing that's next

275
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">week really so the most important thing</font>

276
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,459
that you do in an airplane you guys have

277
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,640
heard this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing you</font>

278
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:15,489
do in an airplane is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next two things</font>

279
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,870
anybody know what this picture is how

280
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,970
many of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could drive a manual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> istic</font>

281
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,430
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit yeah you've know how to do</font>

282
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this on it he'll right forget the</font>

283
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">driving test and forget parallel parking</font>

284
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:28,269
if you can drive a stick on a hill at a

290
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,720
more going on and you have to layer

291
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,660
these things up and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font>

these things don't add up you remember

300
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,160
those situations it was a long night

301
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,410
you know your high school you're driving

it's a little wet you of course you're

305
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,670
speeding because that's what we do it's

306
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,470
a tight corner you realize there's an

307

accident on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner and you realize</font>

you've gotten behind the car you were

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,630
about the next two things you cannot get

316
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:37,780
behind the airplane there's this funny

317
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,040
phenomenon when you start flying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

mode because we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the radio</font>

331
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,300
and you today you tomorrow as leaders in

332
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,500
this industry you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,530
you've got stuff you've got to do today

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,480
you've got deadlines you've got projects

336
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,579
you've got compliance stuff but you've

337
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,690
got to keep in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next two</font>

338
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,250
things are where you're going how to get

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there not just how to get through today</font>

340
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,050
and this is part of how we lose track a

341
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,630
priority the most important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

342
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,459
aviation is the next two things

343
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,800
everything I'm doing in a plane causes

344
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:45,070
me to ask one more question what am I

345
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:48,339
not doing so my dad is an amazing pilot

346
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,170
I grew up every like through my

347
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,460
childhood every Friday night my mom

348
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">would work the graveyard at the hospital</font>

349
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,910
and so being my brother<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go</font>

350
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,430
downstairs and we would sleep on the

351
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,020
floor in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> front room that's where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dad</font>

352
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,380
would put us down because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would watch</font>

353
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,270
Top Gun every<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday night no way my dad</font>

354
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,800
was a hell of a pilot my dad was great

355
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:11,199
and I grew up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this and so learning to</font>

356
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,449
fly I would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my dad about the</font>

357
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,550
lessons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just took</font>

358
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,650
I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him I wanted to</font>

359
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,939
surprise him with it and what I learned

360
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">was you know it's like that Monday</font>

361
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,630
Morning Quarterback you evaluate your

362
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,430
performance he went through and talked

363
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,710
through every flight in every lesson and

364
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,260
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing me things I didn't think of</font>

365
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,030
and in preparation for my checkride I'm

366
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,080
I've passed my written test for the IFR

367
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,079
I'm getting ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to my checkride</font>

368
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,120
everything I'm doing right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is asking</font>

369
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,140
the question what am I not doing what am

370
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,190
I forgetting when I'm level flying along

371
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,050
what am I supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing there's</font>

372
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:52,320
more to this you should never be sitting

373
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:54,630
still in a cockpit in the event<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

emergency as a pilot you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three</font>

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:02,130
principal duties aviate navigate

376
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:04,800
communicate in that order if you stop a

377

VA ting what do you become a lawn dart

378
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,810
oh man use this with you see people

379
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,980
nervous at the airport they're going to

380
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:16,739
freak all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in aviation we</font>

issue we test for everything we practice

for everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let me tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you they</font>

wreck us testing all this stuff and it's

386
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,869
great in the event<font color="#E5E5E5"> in emergency we have</font>

387
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,270
three principal priorities if you're not

388
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,550
flying the plane you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing else</font>

389
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do because you're a lawn dart</font>

390
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,390
navigate when you're flying in the

391
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,520
clouds you have to maintain those

392
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,819
critical speeds you've got to maintain

393
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,480
an idea of where you are on this map

394
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,400
navigation and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to communicate</font>

395
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,130
you ask for help you tell them where you

396
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,780
are what you need and this is

397
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,130
interesting this carries right over to

398
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,959
how we communicate some management<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

399
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,040
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to partner teams how we talked</font>

to leadership those of you their

executives you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer three</font>

402
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,869
very similar questions when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go talk</font>

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,000
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your partner teams every executive</font>

405
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,609
they need to answer the moment you get

their<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention when you book time with</font>

414
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,570
this is very serious and they only

415
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,710
talked to be on a workload permitting

416
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,780
basis they're taking care of the

airlines<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all this other stuff and</font>

just a we're working on this project man

447
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,920
there's a rant I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

448
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,870
right now any of you guys following the

449
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,570
big I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it's a Twitter storm right</font>

450
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,070
now talking about bug bounties versus

451
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,889
penetration testing and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

452
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,929
dangerous proposal bug bounties are just

453
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:08,910
as good as penetration testing no it's

454
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:11,520
not from an academic standpoint I think

455
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,930
it's worth arguing from a legislative

456
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,750
standpoint I think it's important to

457
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:17,730
discuss but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of priority i'm</font>

looking for defects<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

460
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,840
communicate it my big picture is this if

461
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,340
there's an unlikely romance we're

462
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,720
somewhere in the world someone's going

463
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,909
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw this it looks out of place</font>

464
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,000
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about this that's a</font>

465
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,490
healthy conversation how we're going to

466
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,800
foster specific teams to hack and tear

467
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,520
apart stuff to teach us about

468
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,139
insecurities and vulnerabilities in our

technology

470

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big picture the most important thing</font>

472
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,020
happening is the next two things know

473
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:53,360
where you are where you're going before

474

now you guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all security people so</font>

477
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,250
you know that hackers make airplanes fly

his team can write and blog about this

492
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:38,000
you get closer to fast information so

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:40,880
our planes fly sideways when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

all that now they buried it underground

<font color="#E5E5E5">declination is a total mess the funny</font>

506
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,940
thing about when we're flying and we're

<font color="#CCCCCC">planning and we're communicating what's</font>

508
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,770
happening you have to fly slightly

509
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,450
sideways all the time you know where you

510
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,460
want to go but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you've got to</font>

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this other work to get there you're</font>

512
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,000
flying sideways because the wind's

513
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,700
coming from over here that there's off

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,440
all of your fuel calculations the energy

515
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that keeps the engine going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps you</font>

516
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,080
alive there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more going on all</font>

517
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,270
the time you're recalculating

518
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,699
recalibrating and making sure your

519
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,050
priorities are where they need to be you

520
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,490
may not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make your destination</font>

521
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:41,110
airport because you took too long

522
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,220
getting off the ground or winds changed

523
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,990
there's this other thing that happens

524
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,730
and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this happens to all of us</font>

525
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,670
and this happened not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in my flight</font>

526
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,680
training this happened most of the time

527
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had free time between jobs so</font>

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've been</font>

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,110
off for<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three months and my</font>

530
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,980
principal focus was helping some friends

531
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:01,169
and getting my IFR flight endorsement

532
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:07,050
there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that statement I</font>

533
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:08,490
can't have two principal focuses you're

534
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,580
going to get distracted<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font>

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,170
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled away the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flight examiner has</font>

536
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,970
a specific trick they like to pull

537
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,620
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get you started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

538
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,210
about something now there's parameters I

539
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,500
have to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> within 50 feet of an</font>

540
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,030
altitude that's assigned by air traffic

541
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,830
control that way they know where I am

542
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,170
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet other pilots</font>

543
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,850
in a very improper way so I'm flying on

544
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,100
this heading and they're going to notice

545
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,870
that I've started a climb and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> missed</font>

546
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that cuz I'm checking my instruments and</font>

547
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,439
I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this other stuff you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

548
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want you to take the ILS not the vor</font>

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,980
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start looking</font>

550
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">up the other plates I'm dialing in to</font>

551
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,670
get the weather and the radio in the

552
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,260
winds on the airfield and I'm still

553
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,790
climbing and I'm not paying attention to

554
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,530
how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm drifting off of where I'm</font>

555
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,060
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and what my mission my</font>

556
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,399
long-term goals supposed to be and we

557
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,870
get distracted and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the instructions</font>

558
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,310
like hey so I saw that you chose to and

559
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,320
put this into the gps this way can you

560
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:57,750
talk me through that well sure so what I

561
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,030
wanted and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have I busted my</font>

562
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,380
altitude which is points against<font color="#CCCCCC"> me on</font>

563
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,810
this test that I'm now most likely going

564
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,030
to fail I'm still climbing and by the

565
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out I've busted my 50 feet</font>

566
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:15,260
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500 feet out of bounds that's like</font>

567
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,260
paperwork this is a problem

568
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,490
the most important thing you're doing is

569
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,710
a leader as a pilot is the next two

570
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,299

be flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plane for about seven hours</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a break in the middle IFR test prep</font>

getting ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my checkride I don't</font>

622
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,550
know if I'm actually physically capable

623
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,880
of six to seven hours of focused IFR

624
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:51,950
under the hood test level while I'm real

625
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,870
sorry test level focus you see we have

626
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,790
regulations about the fuel reserves in

627
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,260
an airplane a plane that's not flying is

628
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:00,110
a lawn dart so we're real serious about

629
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,000
not letting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen so fuel when you</font>

630
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,428
fly a plane in visual conditions the

631
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,980
goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to fly during the day</font>

to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Airport and if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

issues you've got 30 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of extra</font>

634
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,059
fuel you know if there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> accident on</font>

635
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:16,428
the runway or you know like there's

636
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,990
cattle grazing you got to get them off

637
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:19,190
the runway you've got 30 minutes to

638
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:23,510
figure that out and put the plane down

639
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:25,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">nighttime they make it 45 for instrument</font>

640
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,640
flight because we're socked in remember

641
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:32,840
you can't see out the windshield excuse

642
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,320
me you have to fly be having a fuel to

643
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,240
fly to the airport make an attempt and

644
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,530
realize oh maybe the minimums and the

645
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,179
clouds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fog or too low and too</font>

646
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,370
dense and I can't land here safely I

647
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,980
have to have enough fuel to fly to my

648
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,739
alternate Airport and then for an

649
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,630
additional 30 minutes in case I have to

650
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,410
hold or make a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attempts to get</font>

651
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:58,670
down and that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reserve that's</font>

652
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:00,380
a lot of extra and when I'm talking

653
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,670
through this from a logistical

654
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,520
standpoint with my flight instructor I

655
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:06,320

717
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:30,669
this is the photo you want if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

722
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:44,590
being unemployed there's absolutely no

723
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,159
reason I have no boss I have a wife and

724
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,658
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably good enough and how do I</font>

725
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,129
have so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone calls how do I have</font>

726
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:54,700
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many meetings it doesn't make any</font>

727
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:57,219
kind of sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be something I learned</font>

728
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,509
back when I was running black hat and we

729
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,169
did this a little bit when I was running

730
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:04,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IR team at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zynga when people were on</font>

731
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:07,480
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was time sensitive to</font>

732
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:09,159
things happened one that person would go

733
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,009
dark and focus on it and I'm talking

734
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">cell phone off go off i am we all know</font>

735
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">what they're doing we know how to find</font>

736
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">him if we really really need them but we</font>

737
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,759
would let them go focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> their laser and</font>

738
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:20,109
burn through what they had to do and we

739
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,139
all block and tackle and when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font>

740
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:25,359
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> up would sync up reprioritize and</font>

741
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:27,758
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> working if you don't block</font>

742
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,739
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto your calendar not just margin</font>

743
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,179
but time to focus someone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

744
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:34,649
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

745
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,649
accomplish a whole lot of nothing

746
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:41,049
decision fatigue so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real thing</font>

747
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:43,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical world knows all about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

748
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,539
know who actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows more about this</font>

749
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:51,249
from a street-smart perspective

750
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:52,989
prisoners convicts you know convicts on

751
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the day of parole hearings line up two</font>

752
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:57,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours or at least as quickly as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they let</font>

753
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,779
him out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the house to go line up but</font>

754
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,230
they want to be in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

755
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:04,269
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the parole board hearings the</font>

756
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,460
reason is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

757
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:10,629
favorable in the morning they their

758
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:12,669
wheaties it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the focus and the</font>

759
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:15,459
ability to think critically has a

760
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,989
limited time span<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys from motive</font>

761
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,080
like Pomodoro timer<font color="#E5E5E5"> like those little</font>

762
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:23,350
focus onion apps and that kind of stuff

763
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,269
or Pomodoro onion a tomato tomato timer

764
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,779
the idea is that you can probably focus

765
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:30,690
full laser focus for about 15 minutes

766
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:36,460
what you're seeing right here is the

767
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:38,350
likelihood of an ideal position coming

768
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,239
out of a judge this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an Israeli</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> judge</font>

769
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,158
and what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> found over a period of</font>

770
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:43,989
time is that if you can catch the judge

771
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,679
right after a recent feeding when they

772
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:46,269
let them back

773
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,220
feeding troughs after launch after

774
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:49,840
morning tea afternoon tea you're

775
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,259
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a favor favorable</font>

776
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,678
disposition from the judge I think it

777
00:31:53,259 --> 00:32:00,639
follows logic now we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we all see</font>

778
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,440
curves like this the idea is the more

779
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:04,600
decisions you have to make every email

780
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,159
you touch and respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is at least one</font>

781
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,590
decision one<font color="#E5E5E5"> commitment you've made</font>

782
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,799
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision you make as the number of</font>

783
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:14,918
decision goes up the quality of those

784
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:17,200
decisions goes down makes sense I think

785
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,879
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this god bless whoever made</font>

786
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,369
these badges the RV a sec badges this

787
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:22,869
year those are amazing right I couldn't

788
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:24,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine doing that many of them there's</font>

789
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:28,899
a lot of manual work that went into that

790
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:30,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's phenomenal every time you touch</font>

791
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:33,039
something make a decision over time your

792
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,710
focus goes away anyone disagree with

793
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,049
this this is critical this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

794
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,119
important so when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about owning</font>

795
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:41,830
our priorities when we talk about

796
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,678
carving out margin part of margin is

797
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,019
your rest I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> brag about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

798
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,730
60-hour workweek there are countries

799
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:51,519
that aren't sleeving to a six-hour

800
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:55,240
workday imagine what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would look</font>

801
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,740
like a six-hour workday how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

802
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,600
work on your open source projects or

803
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,649
your extra stuff after hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font>

10 11 12 min I 12 you ever checked in

805
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,369
some code in the next day looked at and

806
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:07,929
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out I had no idea what I was</font>

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no business talking to humans</font>

808
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:11,259
let alone write in code tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

811
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,799
is bad oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodness so the legal field</font>

812
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,360
knows about this the medical field has

813
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,940
documented decision fatigue more than

anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sales people all right we're</font>

863
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,540
this is the six-pack this is the most

864

important thing in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole planet right</font>

00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,710
now after<font color="#CCCCCC"> my wife up here in the center</font>

866
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,060
is what we call the artificial horizon

867
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,750
the attitude indicator tells you when

868
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:24,190
you have a bad attitude it's magic and

869
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,080
does anyone has it guess what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

870
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,550
telling us like the ground looks like

871
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:33,580
it's kind of sideways we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning to</font>

with me on around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clock so</font>

876
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,370
everything in your scan starts here with

00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:53,020

00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:04,270
the altimeter that reads like a clock it

good no indication<font color="#CCCCCC"> of change because</font>

885

894
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:39,680
which way we turn in so it's turned you

895
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:42,830
to the right so it tells us the planes

896

turning to the left tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about</font>

turning left this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel funny</font>

real hard to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that straight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and level</font>

905
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:04,069
it's a turn and slip indicator what this

906
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,440
does is we know that if we put our<font color="#E5E5E5"> wing</font>

907
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:08,810
tip on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lower marker we're going to</font>

909
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:13,759
turn in two minutes that's three degrees

910
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,890
per second so when I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> having issues</font>

911
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,890
with my instruments they could tell me

912
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,900
sings for uniform come right 15 degrees

913
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,700
I put my wing on that line I count to

914
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,520
five I level out and I'm about 15

915
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">degrees to the right okay that little</font>

ball in the center down there at the

917
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,820
bottom is a slip indicator so I think

918
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're driving on the ice when your</font>

922
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,760
tells you all that z axis which way the

923
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,609
planes turning there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">here top left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is our airspeed indicator</font>

925
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,170
this is lawn dart prevention this is the

926
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">most important thing happening right now</font>

927
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,950
so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little under I guess</font>

928
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,930
that's 200 knots pretty fast or a nice

929
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:58,129
airplane 200 knots I don't know anything

930
00:37:53,930 --> 00:38:00,200
it flies that fast that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so what</font>

931
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,790
we have here in the system or<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

932
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,270
test is telling us we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a system</font>

933
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:07,640
malfunction so right now everything

934
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:10,490
looks in place with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> center two</font>

935
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:13,670
instruments being slightly confused what

936
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:16,009
this tells us is we have a vacuum system

937
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,560
failure and what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're</font>

938
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:22,430
cross correlating the instruments to say

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,990
look if I'm turning if I'm turning the

940
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:27,290
right the compass should be

941
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:29,299
taking in that direction that compass

942
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,310
which is usually slave to my magnetic

943
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,680
compass this one here is powered by a

944
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,330
vacuum so it's pulling air through the

these little advisors on it so we can't

951

see out the windows they're going to

952
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,250
take black suction cups and slap them

956
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,490
I'm clearly not a smart human this is

957
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:06,169
like accelerated Darwin it's not good

958
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:11,270
and we do this on purpose and I'm paying

959
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this I'm going to</font>

guys I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you I'm going to</font>

even standing on stage looking at

something I should know how to read I'm

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make mistakes you're going to</font>

those mistakes quickly in aviation we

971
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,390
love mistakes because when there's a

972
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:45,350
mistake that means we found it and that

973
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:47,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is</font>

giving you something to try to pin a

00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,980
this was what die another day you guys

979
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,260
remember this one right Pierce Brosnan

980
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,290
what was this guy's name Gustav graves

981
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,609
he had that cool Nintendo glove and he

982
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,220
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the satellite with all these</font>

983
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:11,810
diamonds it would harness the power of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun and it would fire a laser it was</font>

the perfect bond

986
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:22,819
what I loved about it was this and we

987
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,380
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I used this label</font>

988
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:25,640
earlier but I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about focusing your</font>
