was growing up i skated skateboarded and

31
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,280
I dabbled with surfing whenever I had

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity and i figure now that</font>

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,800
learn how to surf properly so i take my

36
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,420
longboard out in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two foot mush and</font>

give the finger to all the hot doggers

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,620
so what we're here to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about today</font>

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">is deception deception in the role of</font>

40
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,970
information protection deceptions

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,680
everywhere around us every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you</font>

42
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,200
embellish on your resume you're using

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,530
deception every time you lie about

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,290
yourself to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hot girl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a bar you're</font>

45
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,260
using deception<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's all around</font>

46
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,819
us it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in nature and usually when you</font>

47
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,739
hear people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about deception and</font>

48
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,970
there's some notable people that have

49
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,450
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about deception in the past</font>

50
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:24,420
several years<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lenny's elders one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

51
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,310
generally they<font color="#CCCCCC"> compared information</font>

52
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,839
protection or deception in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> role of</font>

53
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,920
information protection as something

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,360
related to

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,309
World War two or at least they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

56
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,319
corroborate it or correlated with the

57
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,720
deception that was used ridiculously

58
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,720
successfully in World War two by the

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,270
Allies I love history I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> World War</font>

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,280
two that's too easy for me so and I'm

61
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,280
tired of people equating everything to

62
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,360
World War two so I've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,459
we're going to do is kind of map

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,640
information protection deceptive

65
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,769
techniques to originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was going to</font>

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,958
be NFL quarterbacks but once i actually

67
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:02,980
started doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research i couldn't</font>

68
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,989
really find enough interesting

69
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,209
information that was just for the

70
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,769
quarterbacks obviously are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

71
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,269
football<font color="#E5E5E5"> fans in the room first because</font>

72
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">i had a bunch of friends and said dude</font>

73
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,790
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crash and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> burn you're</font>

74
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,630
talking to a bunch of geeks they don't

75
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,970
watch football<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said well i'm a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> geek</font>

76
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i grew up playing football and still</font>

77
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">love football so hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll have a</font>

78
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,620
few birds of a feather in the group so

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,600
essentially we quarterbacks they use

80
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,010
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> cadences right so they're</font>

81
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,480
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> deception they're trying to draw</font>

82
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,798
the defense offsides they use if you

83
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,869
played<font color="#E5E5E5"> football you know that</font>

84
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,430
particularly if you're running back your

85
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,140
coaches were always telling you not to

86
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,180
Telegraph<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole that you're going to</font>

87
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">or if your quarterback don't Telegraph</font>

88
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">your primary receiver that you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

89
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to write those are all deceptive</font>

90
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,609
techniques so instead of you know

91
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,170
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Chris and saying you know I'm</font>

92
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,430
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass the ball to him maybe I'll</font>

93
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,380
look at Chris and I'll pass the ball

94
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,579
over here to Sam something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

95
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:02,200
those are all deceptive techniques so

96
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,140
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> World War two the military</font>

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,810
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Masters of Deception sung soo</font>

98
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,850
wrote about it everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically says</font>

99
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,970
you know deception and war they go like

100
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,230
bread<font color="#CCCCCC"> and butter right so as I said</font>

101
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,180
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to talk about</font>

102
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,298
military deception today we're going to

103
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,000
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> football deception so did you</font>

104
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys watch the playoffs in 2014 within</font>

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,680
the patriots beat the ravens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

106
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:29,289
Ravens were crying about you know oh my

107
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">god that's trickery and deceit and blah</font>

108
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,060
blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really</font>

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,030
brilliant deceptive tactics

110
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,180
unfortunately coach Belichick has a

111
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,500
really nasty reputation for using

112
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,750
trickery and things like that and

113
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,860
basically people consider him a cheat he

114
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,949
is a brilliant tactician but it's very

115
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,199
line cheating and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

116
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:53,939
talk about the morality of using

117
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,060
deception in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the role of information</font>

118
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:59,189
protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> today but if you choose to go</font>

119
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,930
down the deception route as a defensive

120
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:02,580
technique in your organization one of

121
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,069
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you will have to examine</font>

122
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,729
is the morality of doing things like

123
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:10,919
lying to potential attackers lying to

124
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:14,370
state-sponsored actors and things like

125
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,780
that your legal team your HR people your

126
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,550
executive leadership team may not

127
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate that so that's something that</font>

128
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,599
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to investigate a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll need to</font>

130
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,340
investigate is deception can be used

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,500
against you so you're actually employing

132
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,698
it as a defensive technique but if

133
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,099
you're not careful it can be used

134
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,319
against you and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this mostly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

135
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,449
improperly deployed honey pots and

136
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,129
things like that I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

137
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,949
about honey pots today that's kind of

138
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:44,159
the easy stuff just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks about drop a</font>

139
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,050
box in profit right so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

140
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,099
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that today what we</font>

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is we're going</font>

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about some decidedly low-tech</font>

143
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,099
deception techniques that you can use

144
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,500
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about some deception</font>

145
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,300
techniques that you're already using in

<font color="#CCCCCC">your environment but we don't call it</font>

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,759
deception we call it security<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

148
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,750
practices okay we're also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

149
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,060
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you probably</font>

150
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,250
haven't heard of depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your</font>

151
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,379
role is as a security practitioner and

152
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,719
where you fall in the pecking order as

153
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,789
far as what information and secrets you

154
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:16,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">have access to because I worked in the</font>

155
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,818
office of the CSO I was privy to

156
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,120
virtually everything including

157
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:24,110
reductions in force legal litigation

158
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,539
that we had going on I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

159
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,370
employee investigations so we are an

160
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,750
engineering company obviously so over

161
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-thirds of our population or</font>

162
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,099
engineers so intellectual property theft

163
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:38,580
is one of the biggest threats to my

164
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:40,740
organization so one of the things that

165
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to do is we align or court to</font>

166
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,069
think about how we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use deception in</font>

167
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:45,688
our environment is we want to align that

168
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,069
with our security objectives with our

169
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:49,979
security program what are we trying to

170
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,529
achieve we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plan and prepare</font>

171
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:55,740
and we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be agile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

172
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:58,649
be ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of fade and move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

173
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,220
manipulate and do different things based

174
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,750
on the responses<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're getting from</font>

175
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,700
defensive deception techniques that

176
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,890
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using so maybe something's not</font>

177
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,810
working let's stop that maybe too many

178
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate users have fallen into a</font>

179
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,800
particular trap and that's not effective

180
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,560
for us because now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend our</font>

181
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,750
energy chasing false incidents instead

182
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,460
of actually responding to actual

183
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,320
incidents and things like that obviously

184
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">after we do our planning and our</font>

185
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,480
preparation and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we have</font>

186
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,659
to execute our plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and again we</font>

187
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be prepared to modify one of the</font>

188
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,220
most important things is actually

189
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,350
monitoring the deception defense is that

190
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,660
you have in place so I was originally

191
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a slide completely</font>

192
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,500
dedicated to monitoring but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

193
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:44,260
kind of pepper that through the whole

194
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,020
talk instead it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should go without saying</font>

195
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using deception</font>

196
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,020
techniques as information protection we

197
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to monitor the activities that are</font>

198
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have to be ready</font>

199
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to respond to them in the form of</font>

200
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,250
incident response or in the form of

201
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,770
modifying our techniques or refining our

202
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,910
techniques as we go along and I already

203
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,799
talked a little bit about the morality

204
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:11,950
in the ethics piece of it so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,710
the definitions or the various types of

206
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,599
deception techniques from a information

207
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,030
protection or from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense perspective</font>

208
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,600
these come from a gentleman named james

209
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,150
dunnigan who is a very renowned military

210
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,340
strategist<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think he works for CNN or</font>

211
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,380
something as a comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terry kind of guy</font>

212
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,150
now or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but he wrote</font>

213
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,849
a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> he started back in nineteen</font>

214
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety-five he didn't actually go to the</font>

215
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,210
links of defining these things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

216
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,890
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these defensive</font>

217
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,349
techniques in that book<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then he</font>

218
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,990
wrote an update to it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2001 where he</font>

219
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually took the time to define each of</font>

220
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,640
these deception techniques so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

221
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read these to you obviously you</font>

222
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,750
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide deck will</font>

223
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">be available from the web layer I read</font>

224
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,500
tons and tons of stuff going back all

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,540
the way to 1988 on deception obviously a

226
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of that was military deception but</font>

227
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particular if you're interested about</font>

228
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:09,990
this topic doctors Fred Cohen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Neil</font>

229
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ciro are basically the foremost</font>

230
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,290
academics as far as evaluating deception

231
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,579
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the role of</font>

232
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,069
information protection they've written

233
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:21,310
numerous papers particularly dr. Cohen

234
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,259
who that guy just publishes stuff left

235
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,489
and right it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy so there's a</font>

236
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:27,639
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there that you can</font>

237
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,589
read with regard to these things this is

238
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,649
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and original taxonomy for</font>

239
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:35,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">defensive deception</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> techniques there</font>

240
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:37,360
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> some refined taxonomy that</font>

241
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:40,120
have been proposed since then I don't

242
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,160
like any of them most of them are and

243
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,050
now they cater to they say these are

244
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">great for military deception these are</font>

245
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,609
great for information protection and

246
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,829
then they rate them in terms of their

247
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,829
efficacy for each of those types of

248
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:55,719
roles the problem is is that they go way

249
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:58,239
way down deep and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

250
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know ridiculous timing things that</font>

251
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,259
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never use in enterprise risk</font>

252
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:04,959
management and various other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so I</font>

253
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:06,339
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe to that taxonomy this is</font>

254
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,569
the oldie but goodie so this is the one

255
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> subscribed to and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font>

256
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,719
we're going to talk about today now what

257
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,449
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find as we go through</font>

258
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,980
the talk is not all of these are

259
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:18,029
actually conducive to information

260
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,440
protection at all for example ruses

261
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:22,630
ruses generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have one slide on</font>

262
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,680
ruses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it basically says use honey</font>

263
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,209
pots<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as far as the defensive or</font>

264
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,649
deception techniques that we're going to

265
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">be talking about there's really very</font>

266
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,660
little in terms of practical study or

267
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,430
practical implementation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

268
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,870
have done and you'll see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

269
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,209
some others that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

270
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">insight for example insight is the</font>

271
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to help think your adversary so</font>

272
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:45,729
what do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

technique no not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> I consider</font>

276
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,760
insight to be the combination or the

00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:57,069
collection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our intelligence</font>

all of our information everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

279
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:59,860
we've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that we've</font>

a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of adversaries everything that</font>

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've learned from trying defenses in</font>

are particularly effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> cataloging</font>

staff and refining those procedures and

refining those results as we go along so

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:23,920
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what insight is about so</font>

290
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:27,579
let's talk about types of deception so

291
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually I promised you football stuff</font>

292
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,710
so I've got some video clips here and

293
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,820
yes I ripped them off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NFL com but I'm</font>

294
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:39,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving them credit right now oh by the</font>

295
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,340
way I mentioned that I played football

296
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,500
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> used this all the time when</font>

297
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,270
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing high</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> school ball and I</font>

298
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,190
didn't know what the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at the</font>

299
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,780
time so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little note down there is</font>

300
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,730
more for me than anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else it's</font>

301
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,459
called the sideline hang out I didn't

302
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they'd actually i dinnae so let's</font>

303
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,380
watch this I've removed the sound so

304
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:04,120
what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's going on here let's</font>

305
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:05,410
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> it first Manziel is a quarterback</font>

306
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,050
he's going off saying what's the deal

307
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,490
why you calling me over here to the side

308
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,569
watch his coaches expression he's

309
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:21,640
talking to him you ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm ready to go</font>

310
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:23,440
ready go go so Manziel takes off takes a

311
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,780
long pass for a long gain it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

312
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,390
got called back because one of the one

313
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,949
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the linemen screwed up but it was a</font>

314
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,500
pretty awesome place so essentially

315
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,630
what's going on here is Manziel has gone

316
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,180
to the very edge of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bounds</font>

317
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,860
and he's cloaked himself or concealed

318
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,079
himself with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

319
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,700
bounds and at this point the defense is

320
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">there looking at what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

321
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">field and they can't tell that he's in</font>

322
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,880
bounds and he's an eligible receiver so

323
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,770
his coach has given him the signals we

324
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,420
can watch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again here his coach has</font>

325
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,480
given him the signals he's watching the

326
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,750
field and he's watching for the ball to

327
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,260
get hiked and then he tells Manziel take

328
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,720
off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wildly successful to a</font>

329
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,400
degree obviously it got called back and

330
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked this guy's playing it off to he's</font>

331
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">like man what's going on here and man's</font>

332
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,840
eels just standing there calm cool and

333
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:18,540
collected takes off and and it has a

334
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,670
great completion there at the end so

335
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,469
concealment<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the most effective</font>

336
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,660
deceptive techniques that we can use in

337
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of cool</font>

338
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,860
tricks here and again I gave you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

339
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,690
disclaimer at the beginning you're going

340
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,310
to see stuff that you're doing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

341
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't call it deception we call it best</font>

342
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,540
practice okay first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one access gateway</font>

343
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,420
this is one that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually</font>

344
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,270
dealing with now as the SEC ops lead for

345
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,400
a cloud operation

346
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,960
team these guys are really gifted

347
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,569
engineers they've written all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

348
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,200
really cool tools to automate deployment

349
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,090
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud we use AWS and all kinds of</font>

350
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,400
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I got over there</font>

351
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:58,460
everything has an SSL certificate

352
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,810
everything listens on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet I'm</font>

353
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,760
like guys this is our primary

354
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,439
orchestration tool and we have it

355
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,960
literally listening on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet in</font>

356
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,010
every single region of the world where

357
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,660
we operate an AWS what the hell so one

358
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,340
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I suggested is that</font>

359
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,170
you know let's get that stuff let's

360
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,980
reduce our attack surface because really

361
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,199
risk management is about policing which

362
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,110
you can police right and having

363
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,940
visibility so obviously having a smaller

364
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,160
attack surface is easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend and</font>

365
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,590
having a large sprawling crazy attack

366
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,660
surface with shitty asset management you

367
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,520
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what's where and things</font>

368
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,439
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have really</font>

369
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,270
comprehensive really solid asset

370
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,040
management and we have a reduced attack

371
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,860
surface we have a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

372
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,410
environment to defend or simple to

373
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,810
defend so what we did is we pulled

374
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,339
everything that didn't absolutely need

375
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be listening on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet we</font>

376
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,780
pulled it in we make remote access gear

377
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,310
that was where I was really boggled I

378
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,709
was like why do we have all this crap on

379
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet when we make remote access</font>

380
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,540
gear it's ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even have</font>

381
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,300
pay for it so now we've got those apps

382
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're there behind VPNs and</font>

383
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,859
occasionally you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got scripts</font>

384
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:12,439
and things I do basically dead<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC ops</font>

385
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,570
which I define as automating<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec ops</font>

386
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and I've got scripts and things</font>

387
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,730
that run and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll find you know Oh Jerry</font>

388
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,980
turned off multi-factor on this VPN over

389
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,790
here you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly</font>

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,730
confidentiality I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee this is</font>

392
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,339
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using in your</font>

394

to sensitive information we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

395
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,950
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways we can use ACLs</font>

396
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,070
we can use file permissions we can use

397
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,870
encryption we can use authentication

398
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:45,380
various other things so if you don't

402
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,660
information let's put it behind some

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,980
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a confidentiality tool like</font>

407
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:03,079
we can hide sensitive information in an

fifty thousand files to it and as we

what I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I did is I went and met</font>

424
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,779
with the senior director of finance and

425

Matt drives to it we live<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a citrix</font>

433
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,459
infrastructure I it's like hey where's

434
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,439
all the oh there it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> be drive</font>

435
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I said Jessica let's figure</font>

436
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,819
something else out so some of the most

437
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,819
critical files that she has with some of

438
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:18,559
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most critical old data stuff that's</font>

439

20 years old even we've been around<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

440
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">while we're now hiding those in files</font>

441
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,850
that don't look like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finance</font>

442
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,250
pots okay they look like they're for the

443
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,459
housekeeper's or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use</font>

444
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,350
catering think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

445
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,419
let's let's talk reality of about

446
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,879
attackers now granted there's a bunch of

447
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,740
studies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that come out that say most</font>

448
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,850
people are in your environment what 270

449
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,950
days or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> before they're</font>

450
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,590
actually detected but are they running

451
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,140
rampant in that environment for 270 days

452
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,780
hell no man I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pen tester for</font>

453
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,970
decades that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it works okay</font>

454
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,649
and every moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're moving</font>

455
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,990
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're pivoting that's</font>

456
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,400
another opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be detected okay</font>

457
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,250
so we're not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go out I'm</font>

458
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,700
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to own a DC and then scan 10 /</font>

459
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,380
8 right because somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

460
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,330
me somebody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff so</font>

461
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,529
the thing is is

462
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:14,510
yes upon close inspection now<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

463
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:16,159
this isn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work for the</font>

464
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,769
guy that goes in and just grabbed a

465
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,059
hundred gigabytes of crap and takes it

466
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,340
out he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at that as as</font>

467
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:24,590
leisure and he will<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually find your</font>

468
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,840
stuff but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for the active</font>

469
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,080
attacker that's in the environment its

470
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,309
security through obscurity yes but what

471
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,899
is security through obscurity deception

472
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,120
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's deception so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

473
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:40,789
cool trick we're doing that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

474
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,250
of testing it out so far I've only

475
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:45,200
caught her people people that shouldn't

476
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,960
have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those files attempting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

477
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,130
get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those files just to see</font>

478
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,419
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on passwords conceal</font>

479
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,190
information behind authentication I've

480
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:57,889
already talked about that low building

481
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:02,299
profile this has to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> NEC cissp is</font>

482
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:05,019
in the room cissp<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow seriously three of</font>

483
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:07,908
y'all did everybody let it lapse

484
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:10,730
everybody said a screw it sales guys

485
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,409
have it now it doesn't mean squat no

486
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,200
offense to those of you that are still

487
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:17,539
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cpes and everything else so</font>

488
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,809
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember this from from the</font>

489
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:23,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">physical security cbk probably if you</font>

490
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:26,269
were paying attention or if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean taught</font>

491
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:27,889
you so essentially what this is is we we

492
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to use skyscrapers for</font>

493
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:33,019
critical systems for bank vaults for

494
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,239
backup sites for dr sites and things

495
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:37,039
like that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use low profile</font>

496
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,590
buildings that blend into the

497
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,779
environment they're inconspicuous it's

498
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,949
like oh there's a cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> of strip malls</font>

499
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:47,240
and you know unbranded warehouse in not

500
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,309
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna go over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here to</font>

501
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,409
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 story building I bet there's</font>

502
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,389
some cool stuff in there so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

503
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:55,130
concealment aspect as well for your

504
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:58,750
physical real estate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your data</font>

505
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,799
centers and things like that camouflage

506
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,960
this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

507
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,299
remember back in the day when football

508
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,360
players wore the brown leather helmets

509
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:10,549
they had no face protection so it turns

510
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,870
out one of the reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought the</font>

511
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:13,549
only reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we moved away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font>

512
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> people got tired of smashing their</font>

513
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:19,100
faces against other people but it turns

514
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,480
out that it's because it was camouflaged

515
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,699
like the football

516
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,350
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened is the original</font>

517
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,350
designers of these helmets they

518
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,059
purposefully created the helmets to look

519
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:34,760
like the football as a deception

520
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:36,530
technique so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from 1930 Cornell</font>

521
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,290
was cool enough to put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff online</font>

522
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,100
and this is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> where in nineteen</font>

523
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:46,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty they changed the rules so that</font>

524
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:50,209
they were explicitly required to create

525
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,678
contrast in jerseys various other pieces

526
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of equipment that you would wear your</font>

527
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,760
helmets and things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

528
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,309
players could very clearly differentiate

529
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,870
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the football and the protective</font>

530
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:03,918
equipment and other gear that you're

531
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">wearing so anyways food for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that trivia</font>

532
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,669
whatever I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that was pretty</font>

533
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,870
interesting so I talked a little bit

534
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:15,350
about the 2014 playoffs the Ravens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

535
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:20,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patriots these assholes did the same</font>

536
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:22,280
thing then next year so what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

537
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,649
in March the NFL came out and they

538
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,879
banned Bella cheats ridiculously cool

539
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,679
formation it was genius a bunch of

540
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were going mean what a jerk he's</font>

541
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,470
a true he's a cheater that's brilliant

542
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,610
though and it was brilliant so I don't

543
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,960
know I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Ravens so I</font>

544
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,459
don't know who their coaches so this guy

545
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,520
says yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna come up with my own</font>

546
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,309
so they banned the way that Bella she

547
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,260
did it but this guy worked within those

548
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:49,340
rules to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with his own and for</font>

549
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,140
those of you that don't know what we're

550
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,840
talking about here is ineligible

551
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,380
ineligible receiver formations where you

552
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,409
could hide or conceal or camouflage an

553
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,990
eligible receiver inside or an

554
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,669
ineligible receiver outside so what we

555
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,220
have right here see this guy standing up

556
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:09,650
that's the right tackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

557
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,150
ineligible receiver this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy right</font>

558
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,120
here's a tight end lined up in the

559
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">tackle position and he is eligible so</font>

560
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,678
anyways what's good for the goose is

561
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,629
good for the gander I guess camouflage

562
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,510
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can do is</font>

563
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,549
change or relocate resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

564
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">can change IP addresses this is</font>

565
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:30,379
obviously a hell lot easier in a cloud

566
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,390
environment and I really wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

567
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,130
some juicy deceptive techniques for you

568
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,320
guys to use in the cloud I'm still think

569
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,880
my own and I'll probably write a blog

570
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,950
post or maybe a paper about it later

571
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,960
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i finished thinking about it i</font>

572
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,820
couldn't find<font color="#CCCCCC"> any good stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

573
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,610
really there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good papers</font>

574
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">there noted in my sources slides at the</font>

575
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,840
bottom of the deck there's a couple

576
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,630
papers out there but they're just one is

577
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,699
just a raw methodology that meant

578
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,250
absolutely nothing to me because it's a

579
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,890
bunch of military terms and deceptive

580
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,110
terms blah there's your methodology but

581
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:06,350
it tells you nothing about how to

582
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually accomplish the work so it has a</font>

583
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,469
methodology for figuring out what you

584
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,660
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't tell you</font>

585
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,180
provide any education as far as how to

586
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:16,430
do it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's nothing really out</font>

587
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,830
there but obviously changing resources

588
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,930
is ridiculously easy in the cloud so one

589
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,090
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do is we use VIPs</font>

590
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,640
or elastic IPS for all of our public

591
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:28,340
facing stuff instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowing AWS to</font>

592
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,840
assign a public IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> address to us we can</font>

593
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,699
do lots of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> things with that we can</font>

594
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,679
kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> them off whenever we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

595
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,170
reinstate she ate new ones we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

596
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,060
them from a web server to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

597
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,800
a remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> access gateway or something</font>

598
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,139
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can kind of confuse</font>

599
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,190
people that are doing recon against our

600
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,720
environment they're like what the hell

601
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,720
there was a web server there yesterday

602
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,630
this is a remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> access gateway login</font>

603
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay modify service ports this is</font>

604
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,170
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people security through</font>

605
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,790
obscurity right this is a deception

606
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,110
technique this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that people</font>

607
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,260
been doing all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time if you're</font>

00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:03,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">running SSH on port 22 on the Internet</font>

609
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,120
shame on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't do that and that's</font>

610
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because the bots and things like</font>

611
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,959
that obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> skilled people are going</font>

612
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have ssh running on</font>

613
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,460
2248 or whatever but for the bots and

614
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,690
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't have to</font>

615
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,120
worry about those and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by</font>

616
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">just running on a non-standard port</font>

617
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:23,679
noise manipulation any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys work</font>

618
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,760
for the CSO or in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cso's office and</font>

619
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,170
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that your board</font>

620
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,910
requires is sweeps for listening

621
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:36,710
equipment and things like that in their

622
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:39,110
board meetings so we do we have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> elite</font>

623
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,730
team we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guy working on our on our</font>

624
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,379
staff that does human threat

625
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,110
investigations and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

626
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,970
he's a former spook and he knows a bunch

627
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,959
of current and former spooks and

628
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,970
basically put us in

629
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">too by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean any offense</font>

630
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,970
by that by that term and so he put us in

631
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,560
touch with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys they bring in like</font>

632
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,270
two hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty thousand dollars worth</font>

633
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,560
of gear and when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

634
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,450
where we're talking about company

635
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,030
secrets and things like that they sweep

636
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,670
they sweep the place also<font color="#CCCCCC"> another thing</font>

637
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do is we say we're going to have</font>

638
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,020
a board meeting it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in one</font>

639
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,390
of these four locations and we'll let

640
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know when so we don't actually tell</font>

641
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,840
them until the very last moment where

642
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,000
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meet and we've</font>

643
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,580
already got our<font color="#CCCCCC"> are got our geeky guys</font>

644
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,850
in there with the stuff the who are the

645
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,689
guys from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the x-files the the horsemen</font>

646
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,490
cruising through there with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wands</font>

647
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,010
and stuff so this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

648
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,020
that's important to our CSO because he

649
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,970
used work at RSA and they actually

650
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that they got owned a couple of</font>

651
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,990
times through surveillance equipment

652
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,310
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this people listening in planting</font>

653
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,200
listening devices and conference rooms

654
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,399
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

655
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,910
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we can do for noise</font>

656
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,640
manipulation we can use noise injection

657
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:51,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">evil electrical sonic other techniques</font>

658
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,360
and the reason we want to do that is we

659
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,190
want to inject noise if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys heard</font>

660
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the white noise machines that you can</font>

661
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,880
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep I use one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

662
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:01,310
wow they work they're awesome well these

663
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,170
types of devices will also completely

664
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,870
screw up the emanations that are

665
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,970
required for speech input devices so

666
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,699
whereas you can train a speech input

667
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,010
device to listen for a shade coming down

668
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,860
for video presentation or a particular

669
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,030
tone on a bridge something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

670
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,620
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> recording because you don't</font>

671
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recording all</font>

672
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the speech right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we still</font>

673
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to exfiltrate that data so we want</font>

674
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,150
the data set to be as small as possible

675
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're going to listen in for cues</font>

676
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,980
that something cool is about to happen

677
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,230
and then we'll do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay another is</font>

678
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,240
noise reduction so one of the things

679
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do is eliminate all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

680
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,350
extraneous or ambient noises within the

681
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,970
room so that this equipment once again

682
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:46,100
command and control will fail to work

683

and various other techniques dns<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

689
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,820
but I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're using something</font>

696
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:18,290
know this is because they have thousands

that's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> conficker if you guys</font>

to at its peak it was generating 10,000

702
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:35,120
new domains every day so we use DNS

703
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:39,980
sinkholes to block those we can also use

property that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was being shared who was</font>

715
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,990
participating all those types of things

716
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,220
we ended up sink<font color="#E5E5E5"> holing that traffic</font>

717
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,990
until we could do a proper investigation

718
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,220
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are boarded the</font>

application properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> service banners</font>

720
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,910
again I gave this away before but yes

721
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,100
service banners security through

722
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,590
obscurity changing the web server banner

723
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,850
the application server banner removing

724
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,889
the development frameworks that you're

725
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,110
using yes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is security through</font>

726
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,640
obscurity but you know those of us that

727
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been doing this long enough every</font>

728
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,450
little bit helps right it's about

729
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,190
defense in depth and there was somebody

730
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,170
to blog about defense in depth being

731
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,430
dead like five or six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

732
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember who it was but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy was an</font>

733
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:43,220
idiot of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> defensive depth is it is</font>

734
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,170
necessary it's absolutely necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

735
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,900
the smallest things that you do you know

736
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:51,260
can for automated recon activities and

737
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,480
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cloaking assets</font>

738
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,610
cloak valuable targets so they don't

739
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,330
look interesting there's things that you

740
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,300
can do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually read about one</font>

741
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:04,490
really hardcore thing this guy suggested

742
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,290
for government entities because nobody

743
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,350
in the government is allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to serve</font>

744
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,580
porn from the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the actual</font>

745
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,820
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks and things like that</font>

746
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,169
so what they suggested is taking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

747
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,850
sensitive portal maybe

748
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,440
e to a gateway to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> icy network</font>

749
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,330
intelligence community network or

750
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,470
something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a porn</font>

751
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,760
site as the Gateway for that hosted

752
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,290
internally because employees if they run

753
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,750
across that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to oh I</font>

754
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:33,020
didn't load that I nobody saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

755
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,280
didn't do that right and there's there's

756
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,260
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do</font>

757
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,970
that as well you know some of that has

758
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,470
to do with kind of everything that we're

759
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,500
talking to here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of</font>

760
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,990
cloaking assets disinformation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lies</font>

761
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,470
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most effective</font>

762
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:51,050
techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use I looked for</font>

763
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">something you know some way to tie a</font>

764
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,460
football video to disinformation<font color="#E5E5E5"> lies</font>

765
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,770
and I just didn't come up with anything

766
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I felt was cool enough and so I</font>

767
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,670
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was like well you</font>

768
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,860
know what if I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I was a coach</font>

769
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,720
what if i put a playbook online you know

770
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd say this is my this is my baby</font>

771
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,200
this is my awesome playbook and let

772
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">people go get it you know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its really</font>

773
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,870
bogus but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started thinking about</font>

774
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,430
it and injury reports came up in one of

775
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,139
my searches and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started looking into</font>

776
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,060
this and I'm like injury reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

777
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">reports so this is a really interesting</font>

778
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">article right here and obviously he</font>

779
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,980
gives it to me disinformation and lies

780
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,920
don't believe injury reports this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

781
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,750
goes on to basically say no other sport

782
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,170
did you realize no other sport in the

783
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:39,740
world has an official injury report that

784
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:41,870
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> required none not one so this guy</font>

785
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,940
concludes then that the injury report is

786
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,459
for Las Vegas for people that are

787
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,410
betting and gambling on NFL games that's

788
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,090
what the injury reports for but you have

789
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,350
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it obviously the other</font>

790
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,810
teams are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that too because</font>

791
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,840
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Manning out you know is</font>

792
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:59,240
Brady out now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to play</font>

793
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,760
against him so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty interesting stuff</font>

794
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,680
there and again this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

795
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,920
effective uses of deception in our

796
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,090
environment fictitious users you know

797
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody talks about that all the time</font>

798
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm here to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this actually</font>

799
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:14,930
works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found out by accident that</font>

800
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,850
it works we have a very active legal

801
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,560
team we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> active finance team</font>

802
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,840
they go to conferences they put their

803
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,850
stuff out there and things like that and

804
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,620
you know I've heard of people creating

805
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,449
fake users and then you ma you give them

806
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,979
access to specific types of things and

807
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get alerted you know well</font>

808
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,349
nobody should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using</font>

809
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:33,340
and so I need to go investigate that

810
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:36,499
that type of thing so we had a deputy

811
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,779
deputy counsel deputy<font color="#CCCCCC"> general counsel</font>

812
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:40,249
person she was with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

813
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,349
then she left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she was really active</font>

814
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:45,739
in the community her email was all over

815
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:47,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interwebs and she got spear fished</font>

816
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:50,179
all the time well she left and she went

817
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:53,928
to go take like an actual GC job

818
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:55,580
someplace and and she had so much email

819
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,470
coming in that there are general counsel

820
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,658
said we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to keep that on and so we</font>

821
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,090
kept it on it ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up being an early</font>

822
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:04,129
warning beacon for spear fishing for us

823
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,039
because she<font color="#CCCCCC"> got spear fished all the</font>

824
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:09,199
time and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really useful and I</font>

825
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,639
was like hey this is cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font>

826
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,940
then we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at other people</font>

827
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:15,258
and our team is involved in separations

828
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,639
in the company obviously because if

829
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:18,200
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high risk individual that's</font>

830
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:20,238
leaving you know we have a concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

831
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,889
intellectual property left theft and

832
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,479
some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that will preemptively</font>

833
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:24,649
investigate that individual and then

834
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,759
we'll monitor them to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

835
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:27,529
they don't take things with them and

836
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,599
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this turned out to be</font>

837
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,519
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool for us fictitious</font>

838
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,899
files is another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of use</font>

839
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,349
that in conjunction with fictitious

840
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:38,268
users right create files so I'm hiding

841
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:40,999
my financial data my really critical

842
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:43,159
stuff in<font color="#CCCCCC"> funky-looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> files meanwhile</font>

843
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:46,099
I've got financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> records dating back</font>

844
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,049
to 1900 in an Excel spreadsheet and I'm

845
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:50,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring that file right for people</font>

846
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,200
that are accessing it perception

847
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,399
management I'm gonna start speeding up

848
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,919
here a little bit because I'm running

849
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,689
out of time perception management appear

850
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,999
to have better or in some cases worse

851
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,979
security than you actually had so as a

852
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:03,649
deterrent a lot of times you'll see cops

853
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,639
you ever drive by a cop going 90 and he

854
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:07,189
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even blink an eye and you're</font>

855
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,658
like oh and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

856
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,909
back in the rearview and he's not moving

857
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:13,519
he's a deterrent he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably taken a</font>

858
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:15,229
nap or you know facetiming with his

859
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,999
girlfriend or something he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't give</font>

860
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:19,220
a damn he's there is a deterrent to try

861
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:21,529
to keep you<font color="#CCCCCC"> from speeding okay same</font>

862
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,210
thing here with security i can say i can

863
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:24,739
go blog about all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really badass</font>

864
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,539
stuff that we're doing from a security

865
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:28,249
perspective and be like bring it yeah

866
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,779
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack my environment bring it</font>

867
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:32,859
bring it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch you or I</font>

868
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:35,749
could say man we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really suck at security</font>

869
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:36,859
you know and then have traps general

870
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:38,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to be using honey pots and</font>

871
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:39,918
stuff like that by the way a note on

872
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,299
honey pots I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

873
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,039
generally more effective for

874
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,629
organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested in</font>

875
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,460
developing intelligence based on the

876
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:48,529
attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are coming in that's really</font>

877
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,950
what honey pots are about right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

878
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:53,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">just about steering attackers away from</font>

879
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,220
your legitimate assets it's about

880
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,109
actually luring them in and watching

881
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,789
them and monitoring and learning their

882
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:02,658
TTP's tactics techniques and procedures

883
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:04,639
right unhelpful error messages failed

884
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:08,089

00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:12,139
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that unknown username and</font>

failed login and it's like man<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know at</font>

889
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,039
least my username was right it's lying

892
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:25,219
sweet i got the password right but the

893
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:29,149
wrong username and they didn't come out

894
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:30,799
right I'm time time manipulation network

895
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:31,909
and application throttling this is stuff

896
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:34,219
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for a really long time</font>

897
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,799
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network year where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

898
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,480
you can d amplify dos attacks and things

899
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:40,639
like that using throttling you can

900
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,379
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> write application code into</font>

901
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,169
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications so it's self defending</font>

902
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:46,879
so it can limit requests and frontal

903
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,319
requests and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can</font>

904
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually defend against brute force</font>

905
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:57,859
attacks and things like that on its own

906
00:34:50,799 --> 00:35:00,559
displays video time so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is</font>

907
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">an elaborate right this is just a fake</font>

908
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:07,670
handoff and he sold them big time so he

909
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,410
did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good job there's actually a</font>

910
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,930
bunch of blogs and things that are out

911
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:14,109
there there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a an institute</font>

912
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,788
dedicated to teaching quarterbacks

913
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:20,359
deception and ball handling and things

914
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:21,529
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so displays there's some cool</font>

915
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,549
stuff here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk to you</font>

916
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:24,410
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you one of my</font>

917
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:27,049
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we came up with this after the</font>

918
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:29,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tesla crip infection last year we lost</font>

919
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:30,920
50,000 files what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed when we</font>

920
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,150
analyzed that malware and then we

921
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,619
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> grabbing a bunch of other</font>

922
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,599
ransomware every single piece of

923
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:37,339
ransomware and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite ones</font>

924
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,609
that are out there today all process

925
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:43,670
files alphabetically in the file<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font>

926
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:45,259
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we were</font>

927
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out we're like okay</font>

928
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,430
there's patient zero why the hell is her

929
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,930
home directory not encrypted well her

930
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,598
home directory wasn't encrypted because

931
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,069
it was on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> V drive we set that as the</font>

932
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,690
beach

933
00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:01,030
and the process actually died so

934
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:03,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">xendesktop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rescue Zen was</font>

935
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,980
churning so hard that it just said I

936
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,330
give up man I'm out of here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it died</font>

937
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,970
and took them out where with it so we

938
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">only lost fifty thousand five but</font>

939
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately what happened is we went back</font>

940
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,799
and research that and said I'll be

941
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">damned what's going on here is this</font>

942
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,860
processing alphabetically so then we

943
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,900
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at other ransomware and</font>

944
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,310
it all did the same thing those<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are</font>

945
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,760
all bar own code from each other anyways

946
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:27,100
so I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea our file</font>

947
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,260
servers are ridiculously important to us

948
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:32,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so what we did is we seed at the</font>

949
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:35,350
top of the file servers with huge files

950
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,150
gigabytes and then we put some auditing

951
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:40,480
on those we put audit events on those

952
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:42,460
and then we use a heavily modified

953
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,410
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this powershell script right</font>

954
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,090
here so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go into Event Viewer you</font>

955
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">right-click a particular event you can</font>

956
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,500
attach a task to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we're doing</font>

957
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:53,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">is we're running this script as a task</font>

958
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,150
based on an oddity vent so ransomware

959
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,180
what to do when it encrypts the original

960
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,350
file it deletes it right so what we're

961
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for is we're looking for a</font>

962
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,529
delete and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

963
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,450
is we're going to go look up the user

964
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> deleted it because all ransomware</font>

965
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:09,370
it runs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context of the user that</font>

966
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:10,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">got owned okay so another defense</font>

967
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,700
against this is managing your

968
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,740
permissions properly she should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

969
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,140
access to everything in the file server

970
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,580
so that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lesson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned for</font>

971
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,020
us we went back and completely

972
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,029
overhauled all the permissions in the

973
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,720
file server<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this happened as well</font>

974
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:31,020
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit two more times since then</font>

975
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:33,850
zero casualties oh yeah ah d TK<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

976
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,240
anybody from 1998 been in security since

977
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:39,069
1998 you remember the deception toolkit

978
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,830
deception toolkit they have a port

979
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:44,140
assigned to them TCP 365 that announces

980
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:46,529
that i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> using deception defenses in</font>

981
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,730
this environment enter at your own risk

982
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,010
so one of the things you can do as a

983
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,360
display is you can open that port you

984
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,360
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> run whatever you want on it just</font>

985
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,980
some crap and then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they start</font>

986
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,740
sweeping the environment they go oh

987
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,040
365's open let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with tax ears</font>

988
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,040
instead

989
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:09,260
internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> darknet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay darknets everybody</font>

990
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:11,900
knows what a dark that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so essentially</font>

991
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:14,240
we carve out some space inside we put up

992
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,640
a packet vacuum server all right and

993
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime anything hits that server</font>

994
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,930
we know something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on right it's</font>

995
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,700
either an insider and outsider one of

996
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,230
the two because nobody's supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

997
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to that area we don't announce it</font>

998
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,099

a few days they caught him there was

1043
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">another one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Samir or somebody and it was</font>

1044
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">only a few days well orchestrated so</font>

1045
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically all the academics that talk</font>

1046
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">about deception and information</font>

1047
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:32,150
protection they basically say the best

1048
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:34,700
demonstration you can have is arrest the

1049
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,770
perpetrators and make a huge show of it

1050
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,379
we owned them we owned them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 72 hours</font>

1051
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">game over you're going to jail for life</font>

1052
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,660
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best demonstration that they</font>

1053
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,279
can come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this is a fake punt so</font>

1054
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,129
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> football demonstration or</font>

1055
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,500
faint there's a few that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use and</font>

1056
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">information protection so obviously we</font>

1057
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,090
talked about prosecution massive

1058
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,190
coordinated busts this psychologically

1059
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,170
damages the entire attacker environment

1060
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,480
so you've seen the takedowns the Carter

1061
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,770
takedowns and botnet takedowns that

1062
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,470
we've had recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like that</font>

1063
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:08,240
that's part of a deception program that

1064
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:10,339
law enforcement is using trust scare the

1065
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,939
hell out of people to stop doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

1066
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,860
things termination of insiders nothing

1067
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,960
pisses me off more than to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend two</font>

1068
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:20,660
weeks of my life investigating somebody

1069
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:25,730
only to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> HR go yeah they're too</font>

1070
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:28,370
valuable and employee bad boy screw that

1071
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,260
fire that fool second man<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent 80</font>

1072
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:32,150
hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all this</font>

1073
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,390
mountain of evidence for you you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1074
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,800
sack that fool so that's what we do we

1075
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,450
make an example out of them we catch

1076
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,900
somebody stealing intellectual property

1077
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,220
we nail their ass<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the wall and then I</font>

1078
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,110
guarantee you people are going to think

1079
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,189
twice about taking our intellectual

1080
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,470
property after that are gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1081
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:51,740
these guys are monitoring stuff and

1082
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,480
they're ruthless communicate capaz

1083
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,370
communications letting the actor know

1084
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,080
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them okay one of the</font>

1085
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that we do log on banners right I</font>

1086
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,770
think it's a PCI requirement that you

1087
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,359
have log on banners and basically that's

1088
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,980
a deception technique that's letting you

1089
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,510
know hey man I'm monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so if</font>

1090
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:09,530
you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in we're going to catch</font>

1091
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,940
you I've got a one a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

1092
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,100
so I've got an environment that I have

1093
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:16,040
and I have a web server sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there</font>

1094
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,799
that just has a very simple HTM message

1095
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:25,740
that basically says okay you're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1096
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:28,110
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching you litigation inland</font>

1097
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,919
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> modified this couple times today I've</font>

1098
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:33,750
been half asleep in litigation we trust

1099
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,490
so we have security researchers

1100
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,990
submitting stuff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us all the time we</font>

1101
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,310
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of things going on we</font>

1102
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,220
have the intellectual property concerns

1103
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,830
and all that type of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I love</font>

1104
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,830
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our legal team I wish our HR</font>

1105
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:48,390
team was half as ruthless or at least

1106
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,430
willing to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing as our</font>

00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:55,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">mess around whenever I find stuff on the</font>

1109
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,100
internet that's not supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there</font>

1110
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:02,040
those guys are with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> takedown notices</font>

1111
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:05,580
we will sue you out of existence and

1112
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost everybody complies so don't be</font>

1113
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,150
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use litigation insights I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1114
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,070
of talked about that a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1115
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,619
not one<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular tool it's not one</font>

1116
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:15,720
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> technique this is really kind</font>

1117
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:17,010
of a correlation of everything that

1118
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,629
you've learned everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you learn from</font>

your user groups everything you learn

1121
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:25,670
from getting your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ass handed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you by</font>

1122
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:27,750
threat actors on a daily basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1123
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,180
that's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it all together</font>

1124
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,830
so what do we do with this stuff

1125
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously if we're monitoring we're</font>

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,930
things like that we have to share the

00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Intel that we have you know a little</font>

encourage you if you're a manufacturer

1146
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,210
or something like that if you can get

1147
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,460
away with this we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have</font>

1148
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,020
mostly engineers and we write a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1149
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,600
code we create hardware and stuff like

1150
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:36,119
that we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> CTFs internally so we have</font>

1151
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,900
product security teams we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have auditors</font>

1152
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,760
that that come let us beat the out

1153
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,710
because they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything you</font>

1154
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,279
know so we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah forget the</font>

1155
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:48,079
CTF targets I'm hacking you but those

1156
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:50,420
are really cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also it fosters</font>

1157
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">collaboration among your teams and it</font>

1158
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,779
enables sharing it enables you to build

1159
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,109
communication pathways that may not

1160
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:59,510
necessarily exist so I highly recommend

1161
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:01,880
sharing your stuff also you know I am a

1162
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,200
threat Intel guy I love it I'm not going

1163
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sit here and tell you you should</font>

1164
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,710
share your stuff with the world I don't

1165
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,710
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the right thing to do</font>

1166
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:13,329
number one as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the threat until</font>

1167
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:15,500
platforms are concerned there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

1168
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:16,849
vetting of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individuals they're</font>

1169
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,039
sharing information with the community

1170
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:21,859
so you bet your<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom dollar that there</font>

1171
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,680
are threat actors that are using

1172
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:26,390
counterintelligence they're actually

1173
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,220
sharing disinformation with the

1174
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,480
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay trying to throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1175
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,899
off their tracks and things like that so

1176
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that sharing is important but</font>

1177
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,740
i believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1178
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:39,559
mature cyber threat intelligence

1179
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,839
organization to do sharing properly

1180
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,579
outside of a smaller set I've got

1181
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,099
colleagues that are in the finance space

1182
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,329
there are big FSI<font color="#CCCCCC"> sac people and I share</font>

1183
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:48,770
things with them but we have an

1184
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:51,859
agreement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't share with the</font>

1185
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:54,319
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's because it's kind</font>

1186
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:56,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the same my belief is kind of the</font>

1187
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,829
same thing as Manny fireEye's so Manny

1188
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:59,839
fire I they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really share their</font>

1189
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:01,760
Intel about most the malware and things

1190
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,410
like that that they know about and their

1191
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,520
justification it used to piss me off but

1192
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,868
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because I'm a</font>

1193
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,160
customer and they save our butts on a

1194
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:11,930
daily basis but their idea is that it

1195
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,910
will make its way to the threat actors

1196
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,799
that Intel and then those file hashes

1197
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,839
are no good those<font color="#E5E5E5"> check sums are no good</font>

1198
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:19,430
and all that type of thing so there's

1199
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,869
arguments both ways I think people

1200
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">should share but I think they should</font>

1201
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:24,049
share selectively and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1202
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:26,058
they should ever do spray and pray

1203
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:28,069
sharing because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what the</font>

1204
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:30,529
threat actors are actually doing my two

1205
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:32,150
cents on that so one of the things that

1206
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to be developing here is TT</font>

1207
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,390
ps4<font color="#E5E5E5"> thread actors so we're going to get</font>

1208
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,039
to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit even</font>

1209
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,348
with these very<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-tech deception</font>

1210
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,420
techniques by monitoring and responding

1211
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:44,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the incidents there that we can catch</font>

1212
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,279
we can learn from them we also develop

1213
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,160
do you have a TT handbook for defense do

1214
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:51,619
you have a playbook of TTP's we do for

1215
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,500
ir so we write playbooks every time we

1216
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:55,620
see a

1217
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,630
novel hack or a new kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware</font>

1218
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,400
something like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> forces us to</font>

1219
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,110
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that we react and we</font>

1220
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,610
respond to that particular threat we

1221
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:05,700
create a playbook for it so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1222
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:09,030
own TTP's and we also will compare and

1223
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:12,870
contrast attacker TTP's indicators

1224
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:14,850
obviously the Brogue I talked by didn't

1225
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,710
catch Troy Troy that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was</font>

1226
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,750
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pyramid of</font>

1227
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,210
pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> so obviously we're going to develop</font>

1228
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,510
these things that stuff is garbage in

1229
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:26,640
garbage out I peas domains file hashes

1230
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,800
those things change<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time so as a</font>

1231
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,029
matter of intelligence and managing our

1232
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,540
intelligence we need to make sure that

1233
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're aging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff out right and</font>

1234
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:38,070
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally an after-action report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

1235
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">time you have an incident</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should get</font>

1236
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">your team together so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk about</font>

1237
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you learned you can talk about the</font>

1238
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,550
mistakes that you made you can talk

1239
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,590
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the cool things that you</font>

1240
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,510
saw document all those types of things

1241
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then maybe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can work some of</font>

1242
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">those exercises based on what you saw in</font>

1243
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:59,120
to your next tabletop exercise any

1244
00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:05,450
questions we have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so is</font>

1245
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:12,750
this what you guys expected more or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

1246
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah Troy oh that was a softball I</font>

1247
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:21,540
wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go there yeah any other</font>
