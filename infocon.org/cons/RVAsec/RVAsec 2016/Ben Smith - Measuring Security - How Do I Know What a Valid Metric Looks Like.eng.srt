speaker i know from prior experience

3
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:32,619
that the best possible speaking slot you

4
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,290
know when the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the speaker</font>

5
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,309
are really on and awake is right after

8
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:46,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">with their heads down that's okay map</font>

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,860
time isn't going to hurt anybody but I'm

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,420
going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep it interesting and</font>

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,239
compelling and maybe most importantly

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,250
for Jake and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the RV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sec</font>

13
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,779
team to keep us on schedule so I'm going

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and wrap up we're a couple</font>

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:04,750
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it already around 150 this</font>

16
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:06,490
afternoon okay my friend charlie there

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,850
was a important piece of equipment that

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:12,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">was up here my slide forward or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder</font>

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:17,949
if maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you remove that from the podium</font>

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:25,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">no okay let me just make sure that I'm</font>

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:28,210
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going crazy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up here not in my pocket</font>

22
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:29,859
let me ask you Charlie do I just connect

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,479
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andy to see maybe if he picked it</font>

24
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">up there was a slideshow or Andy is</font>

25
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,649
shaking his head so if it magically

26
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:37,420
appears guys maybe you could bring it up

27
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">here otherwise I'll just be a little</font>

28
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">more tethered than I normally am which</font>

29
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:45,399
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be talking</font>

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,619
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> about measuring security this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

31
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,049
kind of an agnostic presentation to talk

32
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,179
about how do you think about measuring

33
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:54,100
security inside your own environment

34
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:56,499
there's some good ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it there</font>

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,270
are some less good ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it and in</font>

36
00:01:56,499 --> 00:02:00,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of an overall agenda really kind</font>

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,740
of five main topics that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

38
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,270
with i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you probably the</font>

39
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,749
most obvious slide why are we interested

40
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,910
in measuring anything it was on the

41
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">floor this is why we have Charlie Thank</font>

42
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:19,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">You charlie thank you now I can wander</font>

43
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,910
very important why do we measure

44
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,970
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you some</font>

45
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,740
examples of maybe some poor metrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

46
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,359
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you some examples of the</font>

47
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,070
importance of knowing your audience so

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,810
this is kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> less technical</font>

49
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,329
portion of the talk but it's

50
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,760
point when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to customers who are</font>

51
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,310
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of struggling with the security and</font>

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,230
the business folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> not communicating</font>

53
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,270
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other knowing your audience is</font>

54
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,099
a very important essential ingredient

55
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to give you some examples of</font>

56
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">some good metrics that I've seen and</font>

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,440
then we're going to close out with kind

58
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a summary and some additional</font>

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,780
resources I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to source almost</font>

60
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:59,149
all of the slides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be</font>

61
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,650
showing you today for the folks on this

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,060
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the room you've probably got a</font>

63
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,560
pretty good view you can at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least see</font>

64
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,769
there's something happening in the lower

65
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,480
left-hand corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this slide there</font>

66
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,489
might be a hyperlink as there is on this

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,260
slide there might be just a reference

68
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,530
maybe to an analyst report which may or

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,850
may not be publicly available but all of

70
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides are obviously going to be</font>

71
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,989
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and published by RV a sec at</font>

72
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,459
the end so whenever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see something in</font>

73
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,440
the lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> left-hand corner that is a</font>

74
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,470
sign that if you want there's some

75
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,870
additional reading that is available so

76
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,209
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me start with maybe one of the two</font>

77
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,060
provocative statements that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

78
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:38,570
make to you over the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 minutes and</font>

79
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,410
that is while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did manage to to drive</font>

80
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,450
down yesterday from DC I packed my magic

81
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,180
crystal ball which foretells the future

82
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,560
I don't bring it on all my trips the

83
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,380
first provocative statement is

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:56,079
eventually the insurance industry will

85
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:59,600
subsume the computer-security industry

86
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:02,120
now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a Ben Smith quote that's</font>

87
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,160
actually a Bruce Schneier quote it's a

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,160
Bruce Schneier quote from almost 15

89
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,780
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of his quote is in</font>

90
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,540
the bullet that's flown out here he's

91
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">really not talking about insurance</font>

92
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,290
companies getting in and competing with

93
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,030
the rsas and the other security vendors

94
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,798
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really talking about</font>

95
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:22,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the essential truth and the reality</font>

96
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is once insurance starts to come</font>

97
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,850
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture regardless of the</font>

98
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,210
industry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in and starts to</font>

99
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:32,690
touch the business insurance begins to

100
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,000
dictate rules insurance begins to

101
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,430
dictate rules so I am certainly seeing

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,400
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're seeing as well at your</font>

103
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies and your organization's today</font>

104
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,599
if you are doing any<font color="#E5E5E5"> research in the</font>

105
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,609
cyber insurance space angas got a great

106
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:48,280
session kind of a

107
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,689
round insurance right after mine this

108
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">afternoon so I would encourage you to</font>

109
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,189
stay tuned for that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love about</font>

110
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,188
the quote is not just it's accurate but

111
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:59,439
it's actually 15 years old so one of the

112
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,969
reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this deck exists is if you</font>

113
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,949
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding of your own</font>

114
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,900
environment and specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics</font>

115
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,479
inside your internal environment the

116
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,448
goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you ahead of the curve so</font>

117
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that not if but when insurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starts to</font>

118
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:14,080
dictate rules to you and your

119
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,279
organization you're going to be prepared

120
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with that so why do we bother</font>

121
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,849
measuring things this is true<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just</font>

122
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,169
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> security but for just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about anything</font>

123
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,938
else that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

124
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,068
environment we're obviously interested

125
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,620
in obtaining insight what's happening

126
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:32,050
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business and we want to try</font>

127
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,150
try underscore to speak to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business</font>

128
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">in its own language this is one of the</font>

129
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,289
tough nuts to crack that I talked about

130
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,389
I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some more content on this in a</font>

131
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,310
few minutes the ultimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal as a</font>

132
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">security professional is to try and not</font>

133
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,659
just protect the business but to try and

134
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,849
demonstrate that the security program is

135
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:51,750
continuing to bring value to the

136
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,800
business no one has unlimited budget

137
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,300
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to raise your hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

138
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,250
tell this vendor that you have unlimited

139
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,319
budget I'd be happy to talk to you I

140
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,050
haven't yet found that customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has</font>

141
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,879
unlimited budget it's very important for

142
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,250
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> program to demonstrate that</font>

143
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,490

him to me and they look kind of

236
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
interesting and I said how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it</font>

237
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,780
take you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually generate these</font>

238
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,979

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,069
stuff I didn't recognize as being

they said yeah it takes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

weeks behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus somebody or some team</font>

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,219
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer who produced kind of a</font>

253

no and yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and they said these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are the metrics that we are measuring or</font>

256
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,730
following in our environment it wasn't

257
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,680
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of metrics though it was</font>

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,240
almost like an auditing checklist are

259
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,270
you compliant with this are you

260
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,160
compliant with that so my red light

261
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,870
starts to flash when I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

262
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,660
somebody and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a series of</font>

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,580
binary yes-or-no questions those may not

264
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,620
actually be metrics you might think

265
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,270
their metrics maybe your management

266
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,520
thinks their metrics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my experience</font>

267
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,880
has been they typically are not true

268
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,160
metrics if the binary and then maybe the

269

that that was the case the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

289
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,730
big part of our job as security and risk

290
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,579
management professionals is to try and

291
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">create that common language between the</font>

still a little too focused on the

context we heard Wendy earlier today

330
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,190
talk about using templates in terms of

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the threat intelligence sharing</font>

332
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,700
best practices that she mentioned

333
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,610
templates can be very useful here as

334
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,440
well maybe you are fortunate /

335
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,970
unfortunate enough to be in a large

standard templates for community

338
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,529
eating certain types of information why

339
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,810
reinvent the wheel if there's a template

340
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the business understands and that</font>

341

the business is already consuming maybe

that's your job as the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert</font>

to leverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same template might</font>

little easier one would hope anyway

346
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,880
consider a taxonomy document and by this

347
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean it could be a full document it</font>

348
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,649
could be like a legend on a map there

349
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,240
might be certain key terms that this

350
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,120
month is part of the metrics that I'm

351
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,480
delivering I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define what an</font>

incident really is versus an event in my

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,899
environment maybe use it as an

354
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,579
educational opportunity but provide

355
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,110

356
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,050
we understand the distinction between

<font color="#E5E5E5">those terms doesn't necessarily mean</font>

358

that the audience right and we want to

359
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,430
always be thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience</font>

364
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,279
busy right so a lot of the challenge

365
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have as security professionals</font>

is we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to be able to connect the</font>

to an identifiable business driver

369
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,720
there's some homework involved in other

370
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:49,630
words as you get higher up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build the bridges over to the</font>

they are necessarily responsible for

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,660
connecting your message to an identified

381
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,910
business driver is going to be important

382
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">and because these leaders don't have a</font>

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago having the metrics</font>

00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:33,699
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> three inch no exaggeration three inch</font>

kidding you I could actually see dust

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,500
kind of flying up out of the binder and

395
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,000
I didn't

396
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,650
say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to myself you</font>

397
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,230
know is anybody actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

398
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,209
or is this just an exercise that he's

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through maybe he started maybe his</font>

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,330
to not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a three inch binder</font>

402
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,530
especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got that</font>

00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,270
where we as security professionals we

417
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,760
aren't necessarily coming in to own the

418

risk the whole idea about who owns risk

419
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,020
i'm a big proponent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business unit</font>

420
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,300
itself is the risk owner but if no one

421
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,910
has educated the business unit about

422
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,890
their responsibility to own the risk and

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,660
because a lot of these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gals</font>

00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,720
don't necessarily understand what their

or<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario maybe there's something</font>

432
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,379
that's been in the news whether it's

433
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,149
directly in your industry or elsewhere

434
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,199
those can be useful tools to try and

435
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,790
bridge that gap and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

436
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,170
business unit leaders really are

challenged themselves they understand

438
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,959
this I had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conversations</font>

439
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,490
last night with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

security needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get fifty percent over</font>

443
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,438
the expectation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the business is going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to meet you in the middle the reality is</font>

to the eighty percent wherever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

449
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,510
go above and beyond because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

450
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,050
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand why you are there</font>

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the value that you provide so let me</font>

452
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,120
um let me shift and kind of talk through

453
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,940
a specific example this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

454
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,219
specific series of metrics starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

this number of times we

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,580
report this metric the number of times

461
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,559
we were attacked last month is very

462
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,320
common I've got actually attacked in

463
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,678
quotes if you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very common</font>

464
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,418
almost completely useless this is

465
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,460
probably a metric or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that</font>

466
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:27,260
boiled up from the number of firewall

467
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,880
drops the AV issues etc so this is easy

468
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to collect especially if you haven't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">taken the time to define</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what an attack</font>

470
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,520
is it's too common so if you have

471
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,289
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this in your organization</font>

472
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,730
let's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of peel back the onion and</font>

473
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,080
see how we can maybe start with

474
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like this and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little</font>

475
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,428
better maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to narrow that</font>

476
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,659
focus and<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus instead on the number of</font>

477
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:49,070
unpatched vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well that</font>

478
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of proves that you are at</font>

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">least paying attention to one part of</font>

your job that's great is that a useful

481
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:57,830
metric well you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can kind</font>

482
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,200
of stretch it to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much</font>

483
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,510
more manpower you might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resolve</font>

484
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,299
that gap but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a useful</font>

485
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,340
metric maybe I want to carve it down a

486
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,080
little finer maybe it's not just

487
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">unpatched</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Foles but it's unpatched</font>

488
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,178
critical vulnerabilities against

489
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,100
critical systems that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

490
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:18,530
starting to sound like it's a little

491
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">more useful it's a narrower focus I'm</font>

492
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,010
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to only have time at</font>

493
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,659
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning to focus on those</font>

494
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,700
critical systems versus the less

495
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:27,470
critical systems what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like about</font>

496
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:32,559
this particular metric is the very first

497
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:36,850
word and it's the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> number great good</font>

498
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,559
metrics are trendabl over time so if i

499
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,990
stop this slide right now and say this

500
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,030
is a good metric for us to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> with let's</font>

501
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,510
say I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten critical systems today</font>

502
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:50,149
a year from<font color="#CCCCCC"> now i might have 25 critical</font>

503
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,789
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the wrong number that i</font>

504
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,350
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with has lost its relevance so</font>

505
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,270
maybe instead of expressing that as a

506
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,939
number think about expressing that as a

507
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:02,090
percentage in this case percentage of

508
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,610
critical volt systems we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a</font>

509
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,780
little closer to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ideal that</font>

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to but we're</font>

511
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,570
definitely not there

512
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very IT centric</font>

513
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,730
operational centric phrase that I've got

514
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,800
up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

515
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,330
translate this to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business maybe I</font>

516
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,639
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to abstract it out a little further</font>

517
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,360
how many days is it take to patch

518
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,460
critical systems with critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates</font>

519
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,840
most folks at least on the business side

520
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,700
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been privileged to work with</font>

521
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,129
can understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that takes</font>

522
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,240
one day is better than something that

523
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes five days the extra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

524
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,230
last bullet on this slide guys is for

525
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,450
that security professional who has done

526
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,280
his or her homework and cross the bridge

527
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,140
and understand the needs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business</font>

528
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,990
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come up maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a metric like</font>

529
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,730
this the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of days it takes to</font>

530
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,880
patch critical systems supporting the

531
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,310
manufacturing line in Kuala Lumpur with

532
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,710
critical patches you probably don't have

533
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">a manufacturing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line in Kuala Lumpur the</font>

534
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">point is if you as a security</font>

535
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional have done your homework and</font>

536
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand that Kuala Lumpur or</font>

537
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,340
whatever location you choose to insert

538
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,649
their runs about three times<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outage</font>

539
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,510
time has all of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> other facilities so</font>

540
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,870
there's a process there's something

541
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,879
wrong there and maybe Kuala Lumpur is

542
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,790
responsible for forty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,290
organization's profit and loss so if

544
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,659
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your homework and you know</font>

545
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,570
that from a operational perspective I've

546
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,620
got one location that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

547
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,330
disproportionately taking up a lot of

548
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,219
maintenance unplanned<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance and</font>

549
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,919
it's got a disproportionately large

550
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,450
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> P&L is that something you</font>

551
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,850
think might resonate with the business

552
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,950
leader this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an example of a</font>

553
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,139
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> metric it's not a metric that</font>

554
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,270
spontaneously appears it's a metric that

555
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,530
requires us all as professionals to do

556
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,750
our homework to get to know our business

557
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">peers and to build it out so that it</font>

558
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,440
makes sense this will get the right

559
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,330
attention because you can be sure the

560
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,130
business leaders are focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PNL</font>

561
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,830
profit and loss throughout the

562
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,450
organization as a whole so again Paul

563
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,639
Proctor these are the bullets you had in

564

<font color="#CCCCCC">this blog post that post is freely</font>

and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear me hit a couple</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these points</font>

571
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,559
more than once a because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

important be because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're multiple</font>

sources that have talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them</font>

574
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,830
typically speaking there are four main

<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level things that I've seen good</font>

576
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,470
metrics achieve good metrics are

577
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:37,400
actionable you can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

578
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:40,340
number that's been produced good metrics

579
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,530
are transparent and preferably simply

580
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,540
calculated I certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that want to keep that metrics</font>

582
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,830
how the algorithm that I use to create

583
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,449
this metric is a black box mr. business

584
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,790
guy I can't share<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with you but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

585
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,470
can share the output you want to try and

586
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,820
avoid that at all costs you want to make

587
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,280
it simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make it</font>

588
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,710
transparent and more transparent it is

589
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,120
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to that number the easier</font>

590
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,980
it's going to be for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience to</font>

591
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,260
believe that the metric that you're

providing has value<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that it's</font>

597
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:21,650
to understand what that number means and

then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the data itself right is</font>

be sourced from an internal or air

sometimes an external source that people

604
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,020
want to guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the last build on</font>

605
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,080
this slide is it's a Venn diagram

606
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:44,059
there's four<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlapping circles in a</font>

608
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,980
going to include<font color="#E5E5E5"> all four of these areas</font>

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">actionable common interpretation</font>

transparent and simple accessible and

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:59,750
creditable you guys with me so far okay

612
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,549
what else makes a good metric Andy

613
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jaquith kind of the godfather of</font>

614
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:06,260
security metrics and I've got a great

615
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,389
got several people nodding here I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference for you to his his</font>

618
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it into one sentence here the</font>

619
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:20,299
primary goal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics is to quantify</font>

620
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:22,549
data to facilitate inside it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

621
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:24,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">an exercise to put on a piece of paper</font>

622
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:27,110
or put into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email and send up the</font>

623
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:30,800
chain you need to have metrics that

624
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,990
allow you to facilitate inside so

625
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,510
from Jake was perspective good metrics

626
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:38,660
send to be consistently measured same

627
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:40,730
each time they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are cheap to gather again</font>

628
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,530
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking so much about cost I'm</font>

629
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,210

my summary slides I'm based in

649
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,540
Washington DC<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have some federal</font>

650
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,420
customers most of my most customers are

651
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,490
enterprise and commercial whenever I say

652
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,170
the word<font color="#CCCCCC"> nist to an enterprise or</font>

653
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,660
commercial customer eyes start to glaze

654
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,000
over because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say up it's a</font>

government standard maybe maybe not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

656
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,650
need to be concerned with this let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

657
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,050
highly recommend this particular nist

658
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,880
special publication the 800 series as

659
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:55,250
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us probably know is focused on</font>

660
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:57,050
information security nist 855 as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

661
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,090
see in the upper right hand corner is

662
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,800
all around performance measurement in

663
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,740
information security it's all about

664
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,590
metrics it is a pretty good pretty

665
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:10,700
readable resource certainly one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

666
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:13,939
recommending to you today it says 855

667
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,770
good metrics are quantifiable<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we've</font>

668
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,510
kind of heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> today already the</font>

669
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to compare and trend over time</font>

670
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,510
readily obtainable right so something

671
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,100
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you can go back three</font>

672
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,280
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> from now six month from get it</font>

673
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,439
again consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> repeatable some of the</font>

674
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,270
points again we've already made allows

675
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,810
you to track relevant performance trends

676
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:37,280
over time and specifically points to

677
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,990
improvement actions this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

678
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,389
actionable part from the last slide

679
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,929
you're not just collecting numbers when

680
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,730
your build

681
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:45,379
metrics you want to collect those

682
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,629
numbers to get to a point where

683
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:49,399
something is actionable out of those

684
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:54,230
measurements that you're taking in your

685
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:56,389
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm keep an eye on the</font>

686
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,039
clock we're doing fine on time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

687
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:59,689
about halfway through I'm about halfway

688
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,119
through the deck so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

689
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,940
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a positive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sign let's talk</font>

690
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:10,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">about before we talk about anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

691
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,029
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hydrate for about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds</font>

692
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:20,840
let's talk about five specific metrics I

693
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,429
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very careful as I'm</font>

694
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,199
positioning this to you these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

695
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,090
metrics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can write down or</font>

696
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,649
download as part of the slides and

697
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,269
immediately apply inside your

698
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:30,768
organization because if there's one

699
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:32,720
thing hopefully the light bulb is

700
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:34,580
already going on for you you understand

701
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can't just start with generic</font>

702
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,080
metrics and apply them blindly you need

703
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,639
to do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> homework need to understand</font>

704
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,610
what's important to the business not

705
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:45,740
just what's important to security so

706
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:48,559
with that caveat let me take you through

707
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,509
three good things I love talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

708
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,600
metrics with customers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

709
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:55,999
prospects<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when you ask about</font>

710
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">metrics it can shine an amazing amount</font>

711
00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:01,159
of light on how well how poorly that

712
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,248
organization is structured and how

713
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,789
mature / immature that organization is

714
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:09,379
from an information security perspective

715
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:11,570
just like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second ago this is</font>

716
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:13,428
the Paul<font color="#E5E5E5"> Proctor slide and because this</font>

717
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,779
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not specific to your organization the</font>

718
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:18,619
examples i'm going to give you are going

719
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:21,289
to be kind in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this range I got a kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

720
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:23,178
a bouncing red arrow down it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

721
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,470
to be quite at that lowest level bullet

722
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,179
but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get you part of the</font>

723
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:30,860
way there these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just examples to</font>

724
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:32,509
think about example number one the time

725
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,709
that's elapsed<font color="#CCCCCC"> between incident</font>

726
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:38,450
discovery and incident containment

727
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,879
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty straightforward it's</font>

728
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,340
actually a little more challenging it's

729
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:45,949
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more challenging when I'm talking</font>

730
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">with customers and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> audiences I always</font>

731
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of plant the seeds to say you know</font>

732
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,009
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a useful</font>

733
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,559
conversation point is a are you really

734
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,380
equipped to measure this or you still

735
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,330
kind of

736
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,610
say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> word out loud are you still at</font>

737
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,050
the immature end of the scale where

738
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,090
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just putting out fires very</font>

739
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actively that can be a great</font>

740
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,889
conversation starter do you actually

741
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,399
have an incident management or an

742
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,530
incident tracking system in place today

743
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,600
you know maybe you do maybe you don't if

744
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,610
you do one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my common follow-up</font>

745
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,409
questions is that's great that you do is

746
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,070
it may be the same incident tracking

747
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,270
system that your<font color="#CCCCCC"> help desk is using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NIT</font>

748
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:28,159
more than half the time the answer is

749
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:31,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes should they be in the same system</font>

750
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,330
maybe not maybe it could be a different

751
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,500
instantiation of the same system maybe

752
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it could be a completely different</font>

753
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,190
system all together these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

754
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,620
things to think about as you move across

755
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,510
that maturity curve have you actually

756
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,020
explicitly defined what containment

757
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:48,690
means did I contain the infection on the

758
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,040
single machine where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it is what</font>

759
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,040
if there are five machines or 10

760
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,889
machines or there's an entire division

761
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,510
that's been affected this goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

762
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the importance of defining your terms</font>

763
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,320
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only got one two three four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,540
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven looks like maybe eight words</font>

765
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,129
in this metric but each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those</font>

766
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,470
words what is an incident what does

767
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,780
containment really mean you get to

768
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,920
define<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> professional you</font>

769
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,290
just need to define it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a way that's</font>

770
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,720
offensive and in a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

771
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:18,629
explained to your business colleagues<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

772
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,340
that they understand ideally in a

773
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,350
perfect world you're also tracking and

774
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,290
reporting on the root cause as part of

775
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:28,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this process so don't just stop with the</font>

time elapsed think about the root cause

777
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,210
sometimes that means additional

778
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,800
investigation time etc this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

779
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,620

781
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,360

782
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:46,860
up to our executive management on a

number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of orphaned information assets</font>

785
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:53,460
without an owner I don't have a lot of

786
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,220
customers who like to talk about asset

management it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very sexy it's tough</font>

788
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,470
it's messy nobody can necessarily say

789
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,020
we're at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent you got to at</font>

least walk down that path to start to

791
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,400
get there do you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where all</font>

know where those information assets

actually live because<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately they're</font>

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,490
going to be interconnected and

integrated with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> own network might be</font>

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,469
owners for these assets some customers

809
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,490
will say yes we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so tell me a</font>

little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that how's that</font>

process actually work who's tracking

812
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,630
that have you automated that process is

813
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,300
somebody actually checking on that when

814
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,070
was it last done Ben Smith was the owner

815
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,629
of all the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this file share</font>

816
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:03,629
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time that was checked was</font>

817
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:07,140
two years ago so am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> still the right</font>

818
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,970
owner is somebody else the owner frankly

819
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,080
do all of your information assets need

820
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:15,390
an owner that's a great debate point I

821
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,820
come down squarely on the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of yes</font>

822
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,320
sometimes it needs to be preferably a

823
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,620
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it needs to</font>

824
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,080
be a named person maybe it's a team in

825
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,209
some cases you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to have any</font>

826
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,610
information assets that are orphaned in

827
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,620
your environment because more often than

828
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,500
not that sometimes is where bad stuff

829
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,360
can happen and if you are at the far

830
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,340
right end of that maturity scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

831
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,139
say yes we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good handle a good</font>

832
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,179
wrap around all of our information

833
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,550
assets we've got individuals who are the

834
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,460
owners how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if that</font>

835
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">individual is actually still in payroll</font>

836
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,820
can you prove that the information again

837
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,669
in the example I gave you it was correct

838
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,409
a year ago might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be correct today so</font>

839
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,540
is there a process in place when Ben

840
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,240
Smith terminates that someone else will

841
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,550
be the new named administrative owner if

842
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,770
you will or data custodian of that area

843
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:08,180
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions that can</font>

844
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:12,330
flow out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this one single metric</font>

because it recognizes that reality if

858
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,430
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like me are going to prioritize the</font>

859
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,690
critical items in my environment I'm

860
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to start with the most</font>

861
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,400
important fifty percent so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that's</font>

862
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,840
a good metric to shoot for yes

863
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,910
management is probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

864
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,580
know about the 51st percent and 60th

865
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,500
percent etcetera but<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuales went on and</font>

866
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,800
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full paper devoted just to</font>

867
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,980
this one metric believe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not around</font>

868
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,380
how to put this into place so questions

869
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to ask is okay you've got</font>

870
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,990
vulnerability capabilities you know

871
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:17,850
where they exist inside your environment

872
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:21,209
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you factor in asset criticality at</font>

873
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:24,210
all into that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have two machines</font>

874
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,679
right and they both are showing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

875
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,659
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> my vulnerability assessment</font>

876
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,610
whatever tool i may have out there but

877
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,790
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> both equally vulnerable do I</font>

878
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:35,640
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one is Ben Smith's laptop</font>

879
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,139
and do i know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this one is the</font>

880
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,879
finance server that's in charge of

881
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,159
generating the paychecks for my entire

882
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,740
division which one of those probably

883
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,049
should be at a higher priority factoring

884
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,668
in asset criticality along with the

885
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,260
vulnerability information that you have

886
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:53,040
is essential and sometimes overlooked

887
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,919
should you differentiate between

888
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,560
internal and external systems in terms

889
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,750
of lumping them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fifty percent</font>

890
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,920
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> your external facing systems have</font>

891
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,260
a different role maybe they're going to

892
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,920
be treated<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a different priority do</font>

893
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,390
you have an exception process a lot of

894
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,770
customers say yeah you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

895
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,330
live with exceptions do you have a

896
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,330
process in place that allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

897
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:17,759
track those exceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time if you</font>

898
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,710
have a disproportionate number of

899
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,890
exceptions maybe there's a problem with

900
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy all right maybe there's a</font>

901
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,970
problem with the policy if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

902
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,650
tracking those exceptions over time you

903
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:32,279
and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business partner might not have</font>

904
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:34,680
adequate visibility into that metric

905
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,760
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> four again just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples for you</font>

906
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,040
the number of server

is applied outside of a scheduled

908
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,220
maintenance window we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

909
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,800
look at that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yeah that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,140

customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you actually have establish</font>

912
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,839
maintenance windows sometimes I get a

913
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:54,720
scary answer it's not the right answer

914
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:57,360
if you have maintenance windows are they

915
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,439
consistent across server platforms are

916
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,880
you upgrading your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

917
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,040
infrastructure and your Linux

918
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,840
infrastructure all within the same two

919
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,700
hour window every morning between<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

920
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,890
and three or have you may be broken

921
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,810
those out not putting all of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eggs</font>

922
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,779
into one basket broken those out<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

923
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,779
different windows maybe by operating

924
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,460
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe on some other criteria</font>

925
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,470
these questions again in my case<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font>

926
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,600
necessarily leading to products that are

927
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,160
I say or some other vendor can sell it's

928
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,900
all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks to think</font>

929
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how they have their current</font>

930
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,020
processes in place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe trying to</font>

931
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,879
think of an alternative hopefully

932
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,870
smarter way it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave them</font>

933
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,580
more secure what criteria actually

934
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">determines that a patch needs to be</font>

935
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,670
pushed I've got a tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's telling me</font>

936
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this is vulnerable but it's one of</font>

937
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:46,560
150 vulnerabilities on this single

938
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:48,299
device is there a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place asset</font>

939
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,940
criticality again is going to play into

940
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,530
this these are good questions a lot of

941
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,200
customers you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

942
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:57,060
answers to and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally in this</font>

943
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,100
example are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you classifying and scoring</font>

944
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,340
those vulnerabilities in terms of

945
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,620
prioritizing them over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trey I think</font>

946
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,560
you've got a prioritization talk track

947
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:10,040
coming up maybe tomorrow so<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay tuned</font>

948
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that it's being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> baked as we speak</font>

949
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay example number five percentage of</font>

950
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,279
third-party users<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the final</font>

952
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,570
were reviewed this reporting period why

953
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,630
is this important well do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

954
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,880
understand you're a potential areas of

955
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:32,430
third-party risk we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all heard at</font>

956
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">least one maybe multiple examples of an</font>

957
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:38,040
external vendor who had credentials for

958
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,530
task a and those credentials were stolen

959
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,680
by another party and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> leveraged to</font>

960
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,930
accomplish task B so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

961
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,759
understand those areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of risk do you</font>

962
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,348
know which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your external partners</font>

963
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,749
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

964
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:56,160
and which assets those accounts are

965
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:58,140
associated with yep I've got my HVAC

966
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,970
vendor and they only have access to this

967
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,400
part of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure oh maybe</font>

968
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,589
that's not correct maybe that account

969
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,089
has privileges that allows that account

970
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:09,538
to do other things inside the

971
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:10,979
infrastructure final bullet here are

972
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,470
there any assets where electronic

973
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:15,899
communication to and from external

974
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,549
vendors including system to system

975
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,109
access so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time talking</font>

976
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:22,019
about human accounts don't forget about

977
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:25,369
system level accounts where that type of

978
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:27,538
communication is simply not allowed

979
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,220
sometimes I'll challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers and</font>

980
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,529
they say yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say well you proved</font>

981
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me how do you know that this the</font>

982
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:36,509
set of credentials that you issued can't

983
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,150
reach this very sensitive system

984
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:40,650
internally again good metrics can

985
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes create some very interesting</font>

986
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking points internally one more time</font>

987
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,630
will emphasize you can't blindly apply

988
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:51,630
these five but these are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of to</font>

989
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:54,920
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the juices going creatively and to</font>

990
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:57,269
hopefully start your path down there

991
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,369
we're in the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes karen is</font>

992
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:01,738
keeping me honest here thank you I

993
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:03,119
appreciate it despite everything that

994
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,369
I've talked about they're really three

995
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,609
big caveats or warnings that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

996
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:10,440
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is whether it's</font>

997
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:11,670
coming from RSA or any other security

998
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,009
vendor who's got the world's greatest

999
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:17,910
product to do X Y or Z please do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1000
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:19,380
blindly accept those metrics going back

1001
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:23,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I said almost at the very top</font>

00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,299
overvalue the things that are easy to

1004
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:29,940
measure and we undervalue the stuff that

1005
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:31,229
we either can't measure or is tough so

1006
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,119
if you have a vendor who says hey we've

1007
00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:36,479
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this great report and it's got these</font>

1009
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:41,640
little bit on that to say how<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly is</font>

1010

<font color="#CCCCCC">this relevant to my environment well</font>

1011
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,940
these three metrics we think are very

1012
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:46,710
relevant great let's talk about those

1013
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,420
three metrics and how specifically they

1014
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,279
relate to making me a more secure

1015
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,839
organization versus the so-called

1016
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:54,210
standard metrics that come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

box for<font color="#CCCCCC"> every customer good metrics are</font>

1018

going to typically be customized<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1019
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,770
your environment because everybody is a

1020
00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:01,590
different line of

1021
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,450
business metrics should be actionable

1022
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,850
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard me say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this once before</font>

1023
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,740
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second and final provocative</font>

1024
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,650
statement it's a direct quote from a

1025
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,509
gentleman named Doug Hubbard who is just

1026
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:16,290
like Andy<font color="#CCCCCC"> jayquith a legend on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1027
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:18,660
metric side Doug Hubbard is a legend on

1028
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the measurement side and he is one of</font>

1029
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the books i'm going to recommend to you</font>

1030
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,910
as I close out I am going to read the

1031
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,490
second sentence here in entirety which

1032
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,890
says if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't identify a decision</font>

1033
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could be affected by a proposed</font>

1034
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,509
measurement and how it could change

1035
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:38,460
those decisions then the measurement

1036
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:41,580
simply has no value that's a pretty

1037
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:43,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong statement why am I measuring</font>

1038
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,420
something why am I expending manpower

1039
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,760
why am I reporting these metrics up if

1040
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,990
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actionable maybe I shouldn't</font>

1041
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,910
be measuring these maybe I should be

1042
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking my very limited time and looking</font>

1043
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,740
at other things inside my environment so

1044
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,170
think about the metrics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1045
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,540
today ask yourself that question is this

1046
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,010
a number either by itself or in

1047
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,650
conjunction with other numbers something

1048
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:08,160
that is going to be actionable either by

1049
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:11,520
me or by my executive team third and

1050
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,319
final caveat is let's say you've drunk

1051
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,670
the kool-aid over the last 45 minutes

1052
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,170
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to march out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here</font>

1053
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create the world's</font>

1055
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome I hope you do that let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me know</font>

1056
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,330

<font color="#CCCCCC">makes sense it Maps cleanly to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">business it's a winner you roll out the</font>

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,160
metric you roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the metric and this</font>

1062
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,160
happens

1063
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,900
see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here the guy on the</font>

1064
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,240
left is convinced oh yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a 6</font>

1065
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,420
the guy on the light right with the very

1066
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,830
same number from a different perspective

1067
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,350
says you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this this tells a</font>

1068
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:55,090
different story and maybe not the story

1069
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:57,819
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you intended the business to</font>

1070
00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:00,250
understand so the moral the story here

1071
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,340
is spend that good work building that

1072

metric bounce it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off a pier or two or</font>

say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the world's greatest metric</font>

1077
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,830
they say yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not telling me the</font>

00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">story that you're telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's too</font>

1079
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:19,240
easy for all of us to kind of get locked

1080
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:20,710
in and over focus on what we're doing

1081
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">and forgetting other people's</font>

1082
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,530
perspective this goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1083
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,260
importance of knowing your audience that

1084
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:28,000
would kind of start with all right we're

1085
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,490
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last couple of slides I got about</font>

1086
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
five minutes so we are still on track

1087
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:36,100
this is the optional homework section

1088
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right if you are at all interested</font>

1089
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:41,470
in learning a little bit more I've got

1090
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,300
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> books on this slide starting with</font>

what I call kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the one place to</font>

1092
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:48,100
start from a foundational perspective

I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it in italics strategic if</font>

you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning as much as</font>

00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,310
you can about metrics the Doug Hubbard

00:42:54,310 --> 00:43:00,970
anything now in its third edition is a

1098
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,770
great resource to start great news is

1099
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">doug hubbard has another book coming out</font>

1100
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:06,790
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be out by now</font>

1101
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,650
it's a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months delayed it's coming</font>

1102
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,509
out in the next three months its title

1103
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,600
is how to measure anything in cyber

1104
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:15,840
security risk it's an entire book from

mine's been on pre-order since december

1107
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,200
i can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to arrive if you</font>

1108
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,149
have the time to start with the

1109
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,830
foundational reading you can't do better

1110
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,140
than Doug Hubbard's how to measure

1111
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,759
anything most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us live in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the real</font>

1113
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,640

1114
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,600
the strategic stuff so tactically I'm

1115
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,730
cheating here I'm kind of giving you the

1116
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,950
CliffsNotes version if you can't start

1117
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,560
with the strategic here's some tactical

1118
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:48,629
recommendations for reading starting

1119
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,549
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an TJ quits book securitymetrics</font>

00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:54,100
don't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid this one's a little</font>

1121
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,810
older it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

1122
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,880
at this point it's the place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

1123
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,759
tactically it's around metrics

1124
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,960
specifically in the security space

1125
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,940
brought me and Henson more recently

1126
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,390
published a great book called pragmatic

00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:10,000
securitymetrics pragmatics and all caps

1128
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:11,710
there it's nine different letters nine

1129
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,470
different dimensions by which you can

1130
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,570
objectively rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever metric you</font>

1131
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,339
have come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

1132
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,190
process let's say you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten metrics</font>

1133
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,990
each of those metrics have been scored

1134
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:25,030
based across this nine dimension

1135
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,890
pragmatic model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that</font>

1136
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,750
something that's scoring a 95 is

1137
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,060
probably a pretty good metric on a 0 to

1138

100 scale versus something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a 40</font>

that tactical area we didn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1145
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,550
visualization today but I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1146
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,160
throw out a big plug for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edward Tufte</font>

1147
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,920
who is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my money the godfather</font>

1148
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:56,529
of data and information visualization

1149
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,200
he's a statistics professor at Yale but

1150
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:01,080
he's much very well known for<font color="#E5E5E5"> his first</font>

1151
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,029
book the visual display of quanta

1152
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,220
quantitative information about 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

1153
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:08,020
old if you are at all interested in kind

1154
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,790
of taking that next step to think about

1155
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,460
how should i present it so that it's

1156
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,279
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be easily consumable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tufte is a</font>

1157
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,140
great strategic place to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if</font>

1158
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,170
you live in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world like I do</font>

1159
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:23,650
maybe tactically I would recommend Greg

1160
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:25,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Conte's security data visualization that</font>

1161
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,450
is a really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good book that is</font>

1162
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,279
just focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to present security</font>

1163
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,990
data both to the executive and the

1164
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,390
non-executive this particular book is

1165
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,370
out of print but it won't take you too

1166
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:39,700
much work to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a used copy if you're</font>

1167
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:41,770
interested rafi<font color="#E5E5E5"> marty has a good book</font>

1168
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,419
called applied security visualization

1169
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:45,100
along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same lines I would start with</font>

1170
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,920
the Conte book the green one on the

1171
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">screen and then if you've got the time</font>

1172
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,800

1173
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,630
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get individualization</font>

1174
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,470
again for extra credit that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that</font>
