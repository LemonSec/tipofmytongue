1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:27,869
good morning everybody good morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I'm going to step here because all</font>

3
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pictures of me speaking will I look</font>

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:39,269
like this if I find<font color="#CCCCCC"> the behind the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boat</font>

5
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:42,390
yeah I loved all the cybers in senator

6
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,260
Warner's talk I I do want to make a

7
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple of comments or Corrections there</font>

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,879
this is probably the wrong place to do

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,280
it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

10
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,070
don't necessarily need a degree to to

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,700
work in cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have precisely zero</font>

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,590
degrees so don't let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stop you</font>

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:07,440
although seriously they'll stay in

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,610
school don't be like me and but if you

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,160
know if you're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that track</font>

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,180
great but don't let it hold you back if

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you know if you don't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that degree</font>

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about lessons that I</font>

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,550
have learned from sharing threat

20
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:23,729
intelligence from trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people</font>

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,950
to share nicely it started when I became

22
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,140
a mom but it has not really changed all

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:34,319
that much since then there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,000
cake and more beer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're going to</font>

25
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,720
talk about how threat intelligence

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,580
usually starts it starts with you know

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,349
two people in a bar and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting</font>

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,940
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know you you've got a</font>

29
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,160
friend who's at another company and

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,289
you're going you know we saw something

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this dude have you guys seen that</font>

32
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:55,740
and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it always starts I end up</font>

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,240
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who um you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,830
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you know are you sharing</font>

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,050
threat intelligence you know with other

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,610
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said</font>

37
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,899
does your management know and they're

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:09,929
like no um so the gossip is how it

39
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,819
starts and what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

40
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,420
bring things you know up to a sort of

41
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:18,390
grown up berryessa tears oh I'm sorry

42
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not the sock that's a pub that</font>

43
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,730
could have been last night<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually but</font>

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,380
you know same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I don't know how</font>

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,000
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people drinking on Monday morning</font>

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the sock but probably more should</font>

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,790
so why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing this as you know the</font>

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is that as defenders we have</font>

49
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,540
the big problem that we have to plug

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,540
everything and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ackers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only need to</font>

51
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,310
be right<font color="#E5E5E5"> once but with sharing threat</font>

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,750
intelligence hopefully we can flip that

53
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,430
asymmetry so that if they are not good

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,280
in their<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC or you know if their</font>

55
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,080
attack is detected they only have to

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,990
mess up once and if we can share that

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">information quickly then you know</font>

58
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,860
they're they're messed up and they have

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,790
to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know change their</font>

60
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,720
their method<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operating now that's a</font>

61
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,780
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and and I real plot it but</font>

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously it doesn't work in a lot of</font>

63
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,370
similar situations because that's kind

64
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,070
of how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected antivirus to work</font>

65
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,750
does anybody remember aunty but it's

66
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,310
like we see what they're doing we write

67
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,810
something to stop them we share it

68
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,950
everywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes care of the</font>

69
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:36,890
problem right so yeah not so much in

70
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:39,209
fact David J Bianco who came up with

71
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,929
amazing pyramid of paint is he in the

72
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,459
advanced David hey there you are I want

73
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give David a round of applause for</font>

74
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:52,170
coming up with this but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

75
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,480
times um somebody encapsulates an idea

76
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,518
so well that you just end up using it

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,410
over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over again I was</font>

78
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going over my presentation last</font>

79
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,670
night and I pyramid of pain in there and

80
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,550
then I thought you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

81
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,220
salt of threat intelligence you know you

82
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,560
can it's missing it's not zippy enough

83
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,709
and I went no I got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it in there</font>

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,100
so for those of you who are not familiar

85
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,530
with it you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably see very</font>

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,880
clearly what the thing is but the idea

87
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,909
is that when the adversary when we are

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,620
picking up indicators at certain levels

89
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,510
it's at a different level it causes a

90
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,840
different level of pain to the adversary

91
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:36,210
to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so for hashes if we're</font>

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,840
passing around hashes it is trivial<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

93
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:43,200
them to change it and so you get in this

94
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,119
huge you know quick arms race where

95
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,490
they're changing things faster than you

96
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,009
can

97
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,560
municate them and detect them block them

98
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:55,419
in my experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> hashes are really only</font>

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,340
useful to identify first of all maybe if

100
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,740
if you've seen something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your end</font>

101
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,270
point but usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> malware's</font>

102
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,550
customize these days anyway so it's

103
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,859
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a different hash most of the</font>

104
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,990
uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hashes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see now are when you're</font>

105
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,550
pointing to something on virustotal and

106
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,800
you want somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a look at it</font>

107
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:16,360
it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> x</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x hash here go look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,310
one so that's a lot more static and not

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what we had intended or</font>

110
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,970
envisioned when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about sharing</font>

111
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,758
hashes as indicators originally but

112
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:28,479
that's we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> today IP addresses are</font>

113
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:33,610
easy again there are folks who are

114
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,560
working on trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict rotation of</font>

115
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,240
IP addresses to try to get to get ahead

116
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,819
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those same thing with domain names</font>

117
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,380
especially automatically generated ones

118
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,810
they're trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the</font>

119
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">patterns that adversaries are using to</font>

120
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,620
generate those domain names get ahead of

121
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,990
them take the ones that aren't

122
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,699
registered yet and sinkhole them but

123
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,320
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a that's a race that is</font>

124
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:58,960
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to win and we're going</font>

125
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:01,300
about rowing annoying things you know if

126
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,930
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are artifacts that we are finding</font>

127
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,820
on on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems and end points yes</font>

128
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,229
they have to you know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

129
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,770
have to make some<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes to their tools</font>

130
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:14,050
in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change those artifacts such</font>

131
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,810
that we can't go look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them that</font>

132
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,930
easily anymore so this isn't the more

133
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,419
pain their actual tools do the ones that

134
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,909
are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> sold that are actually being</font>

135
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,409
monetized by adversaries that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

136
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:28,509
to be very annoying for them to have to

137
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">change those especially if they're in</font>

138
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,120
very wide use which do see and then

139
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally the TTP's like who they are the</font>

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,690
methods that they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font>

141
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,759
very tough for them to change so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

142
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,569
try if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an arms</font>

144
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,889
stuff near the top instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

145
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,310
that's harder for them to change I kind

147
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,580
probably see like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom three being</font>

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,259
folded back into out

commercial threat intelligence and back

150
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,800
into security products which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

151
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,679
where they should have been to begin

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,569
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that commercial threat</font>

153
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,729
intelligence is good and focus on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

154
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:19,710
top three but that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my feeling</font>

155
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:21,240
on it that's my call so our sisk that's

156
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,520
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pronounce it I'm sorry I didn't</font>

157
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,840
make it up it<font color="#E5E5E5"> autocorrects to cisco on</font>

158
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,500
my phone there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do about</font>

159
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,979
it the the retail Cyber Intelligence

<font color="#E5E5E5">address this problem for retailers so we</font>

162
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:43,830
were kind of spun off from the retail

163
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,990
industry leaders<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association an angle</font>

the executive director started last

165
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,620
februari I so we sort of have become

166
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,889
operational since that time we're up to

167
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,990
about 80 members of many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

target that sort of thing but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

173

financial institutions who do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot with</font>

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,550
retail who are already part of the FSI

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,839
type of threat intelligence that we talk

177
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is also pertinent to you have a</font>

178
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,099
very wide population and as you can

179
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,050
imagine the level of maturity is very

180
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:31,319
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some that are very</font>

181
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,899
very high and there are some yeah that

182
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,240
need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of help so it's a challenging</font>

183
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,339
environment to work in these are the

184
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,979
members that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can mention as they are</font>

185
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:46,019
on the board but you know then the other

186
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:49,470
ones are out there too now<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

187
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,029
about threat intelligence itself the

188
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,279
problem is that trust tends to happen

189
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,930
between individuals not<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

190
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,550
organizations so again if you are

191
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking with your friend in the pub</font>

192
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,899
who's the sizzle at this other

193
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,459
organization if they leave who are you

194
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,810
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks down pretty</font>

195
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:09,719
quickly and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

196
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,729
that the value depends in part on it

197
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,320
being exclusive you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know this</font>

198
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,730
don't tell anybody else

199
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,410
because we don't want the word to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

200
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,680
out because then the adversary will find

201
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:23,610
out or or this sort of thing and i'll

202
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,160
talk about market forces later and what

203
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,620
you can use all sorts of fancy platforms

204
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,569
and forums and you know all this kind of

205
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,880
stuff but in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever there's a</font>

206
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,560
disruption<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the signal because the</font>

207
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,880
defaults back to two people in an email

208
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,359
that's that's just the way it tends<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

209
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen so these are these are all kind</font>

210
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the opposite of sharing and these are</font>

211
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,770
the challenges that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

212
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,750
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking of challenges i</font>

213
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,600
want to quote my friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> Javad like who's</font>

214
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,400
talks about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have a</font>

215
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,010
problem there are no problems only

216
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:05,160
opportunities ok so we're facing a ddos

217
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:07,920
opportunity so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with this</font>

218
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,959
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering just like you guys do</font>

219
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,969
when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into someplace</font>

220
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,660
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering works with everybody</font>

221
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,370
in fact i would venture to say that

222
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,560
being a SISO is the hardest social

223
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,360
engineering job that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if</font>

224
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,729
you can get a thousand people to click

225
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,260
on a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not impressed if you can</font>

226
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,550
get a thousand people to stop clicking

227
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:33,420
on a link then i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really impressed</font>

228
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:35,370
so we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get um you know to</font>

229
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,349
get people to share we need to do this

230
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,820
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of social engineering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so one of the</font>

231
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,470
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that works well for us</font>

232
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,500
is emphasizing that personal connection

233
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:47,700
we introduce people to one another our

234
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">members we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have events where people get</font>

235
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,980
together and look each other in the face

236
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,580
one of the other things is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

237
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,200
hard to get a response out of a group of

238
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">people if you say you know who wants to</font>

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,690
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this silence you know nobody</font>

240
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,730
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak up but if you prep them</font>

241
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,800
before the event or the call and say you

242
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,380
know can you bring a<font color="#E5E5E5"> story to talk about</font>

243
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,990
this i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call on you then you</font>

244
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get the discussion going so you've</font>

245
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,470
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appeal to people as individuals</font>

246
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help them make that</font>

247
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,950
individual connection over and over and

248
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,900
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and really that's what all</font>

249
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,330
what all these conferences are about is

250
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:28,069
about people meeting people it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

251
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,070
about eating groups

252
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,850
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also do have to say never estimate</font>

253
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:40,650
the booze at some of our roundtable

254
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,110
events you know you put a stake in front

255
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,319
of somebody and<font color="#CCCCCC"> some wine and the</font>

256
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,390
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gets amazing so that's</font>

257
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,860
where a lot of stuff especially if there

258
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,689
are organizations that are nervous about

259
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,610
putting things in writing they're going

260
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to want to talk you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know either on the</font>

261
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,830
phone or in person at an event and they

262
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,680
will tell stories that they will not put

263
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,450
in writing anywhere so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is</font>

264
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,699
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> good if you get an opportunity to</font>

265
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,740
attend these sorts of events do because

266
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,900
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get intelligence on a</font>

267
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,630
very different level from what you're

268
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:18,090
reading in other places and also as with

269
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,730
threat intelligence if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you or social</font>

270
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,840
engineering if you are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

271
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,880
know to work your way into an

272
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,510
organization people like to be helpful

273
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's just human nature so</font>

274
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,810
appealing to people we have a lot of

275
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,790
members who have said they have joined

276
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,699
because they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help make the</font>

community better and so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,850
somebody and saying you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know this</font>

problem with this I know you've worked

281
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it would you be willing to talk with</font>

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,790
some extent or another they may say okay

284
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,250
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> inviting them into our data</font>

285
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,630
center but you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk with</font>

286
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,370
them about what their what<font color="#CCCCCC"> their thing</font>

287
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is so appealing to people's better</font>

288
00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:00,630
natures actually works really well and

289
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,670
then another thing that i found that

290
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,080
works a lot is giving them reminders

291
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,819
that they control what information

292
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,070
they're sharing they control the

293
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,010
exchange so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to somebody</font>

294
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:14,100
and another thing that happens a lot in

295
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the eye sack is somebody will send an</font>

296
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,510
anonymous request for information and

297
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,150
they'll want me to send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on their</font>

298
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,939
behalf so who's done some work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

299
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,980
or who's seen this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll send it out</font>

300
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,840
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer and maybe</font>

301
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else says I really want to know</font>

302
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,830
more from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that submitter would it be</font>

303
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,960
okay if I talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them so I'll go back</font>

304
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the original submitter and say you</font>

305
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,830
know Oh so-and-so would like to know if

306
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,570
they can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you about it and they</font>

307
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,450
go oh yeah we know them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

308
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,740
so that kind of negotiation back and

309
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:49,580
forth back and forth happens a lot and

310
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,650
then but but it's their decision to

311
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">decide you know who to talk to how much</font>

312
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,510
to say to them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything so every</font>

313
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">time somebody submits something some</font>

314
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,350
threat intelligence we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure to ask</font>

315
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,200
them are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you sanitized it the</font>

316
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,820
way you want it you know I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

317
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,620
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be we</font>

318
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,090
want to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> this with this group of</font>

319
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,940
people but if there's anybody you don't

320
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,680
want in there we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out all</font>

321
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,510
that reminder that they are in control

322
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,790
that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps them feel more</font>

323
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:23,520
comfortable about sharing and then

324
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,040
feedback lots of lots of feedback and

325
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,600
appreciation thanking people saying this

326
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,099
really made a difference when you did

327
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,510
this again it goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> people being</font>

328
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,810
helpful not this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of feedback but</font>

329
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:38,069
you know we've given Awards we you know

330
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,959
just calling people than<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you know</font>

331
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,080
man thanks I you know I owe you a cup of

332
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,270
coffee for doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that really</font>

333
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,710
helps keep things flowing is it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

334
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,910
or does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look like Hugh Laurie</font>

335
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:57,860
playing house it really looks that way

336
00:14:50,910 --> 00:15:00,000
to me so we've all been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

337
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,060
figuring out what other barriers there

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,310
are two sharing in threat intelligence

339
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:12,800
so we we went in with George Mason

340
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:14,790
University on one of their masters

341
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,750
programs was doing their capstone

342
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,880
projects on all sorts of cyber security

343
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,430
products a project so we said why don't

344
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to figure out do some surveys</font>

345
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,479
and interviews with our population and

346
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,120
find out if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other barriers to</font>

347
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,340
sharing that we can address so this

348
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,140
great group of students worked on this

349
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,880
and they just came out with a report I

350
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're going to be publishing it</font>

351
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:42,870
soon but I can give you a few highlights

352
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,579
from it one of the things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

353
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping them sharing at least according</font>

354
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,120
to them and I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the numbers</font>

355
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,290
are really small but they don't really

356
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter you can see the height of the</font>

357
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,660
other bars right it's the bars that

358
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,660
count

359
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,440
when we asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> them when we said my</font>

360
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,500
organization needs more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the following</font>

361
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,560
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contribute additional</font>

362
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,840
cyber threat intelligence they that

363
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,510
Muslims they need more confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

364
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,870
security of available sharing mechanisms

365
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,920
now that's kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

366
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,840
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really sure what that means</font>

367
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,550
what do you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by security do you want</font>

368
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,980
to know if our platform is secure do you

369
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,510
want to know if the people you're

370
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,390
telling are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell other</font>

371
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,430
people you know what security can be

372
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,319
technological it can be in process it

373
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">can be in people so you know we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

374
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">really sure what they meant by that the</font>

375
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,050
other interesting one is information

376
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,980
about options for protecting our

377
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,390
information once it is shared that's

378
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,750
kind of letting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cat out of the bag</font>

379
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,970
I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really sure what</font>

380
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,400
options we could offer them short<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

381
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:51,960
saying you know okay we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this you</font>

382
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,670
know triple you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> raat 26 inside and</font>

383
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,320
then encrypted and then and then you

384
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,420
know encased in concrete and thrown in

385
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom of a pool I'm not really sure</font>

386
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,660
what we can say to them there but it's

387
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,480
interesting that they responded that way

388
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,800
to it staffing resources is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

389
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,930
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going to see more of that</font>

390
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">and interestingly after there's you know</font>

391
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe I'm not sure how many</font>

392
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,810
organizations this translate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to butt 6.3</font>

393
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,599
percent now we're good we're already

394
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,780
contributing enough CTI<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

395
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,980
what that what that means either the

396
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,599
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that I have to</font>

397
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,750
acknowledge that there is large sample

398
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,490
bias in this because we asked our

399
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:32,130
members of the retail I sack and

400
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,990
obviously they wouldn't a joint if they

401
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,890
weren't already predisposed to sharing

402
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,540
so you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that clear that</font>

403
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,310
there's a definite bias in these answers

404
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:46,080
but even so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the answers are</font>

405
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:48,330
interesting another one is again lack of

406
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,540
staffing sources my organization needs

407
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,639
more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the following to be able to</font>

408
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:56,129
process understand the cyber threat

409
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,900
intelligence it receives or to be able

410
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to act on the cyber threat intelligence</font>

411
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,600
that receive so process and understand

412
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,580
versus act on and you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that say</font>

413
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,300
the majority always need<font color="#CCCCCC"> more people</font>

414
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,220
the process what they're going through

415
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,010
everybody is overwhelmed the Amazons of

416
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,170
the world have too much data no matter

417
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,790
what size you are you have too much data

418
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,050
to have to deal with and that's an

419
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:23,790
ongoing problem in threat intelligence

420
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:28,320
additional context to help make sense of

421
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:31,230
the CTI receives now first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I hate</font>

422
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,879
the word context I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's</font>

423
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,050
really overused when people really mean

424
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,220
details so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you an example</font>

425
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,620
back when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> working for a state</font>

426
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,310
agency we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of our service</font>

427
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,110
was talking out to an IP address and

428
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,310
usually what vendors will say is context

429
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,830
is they'll also give you the geolocation

430
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,230
of that IP address as best as they can

431
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,909
understand it assuming not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle</font>

432
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,410
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. in the middle of a pond or</font>

433
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:00,360
or whatever for us that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an additional</font>

434
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:04,170
detail we found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the geolocation</font>

435
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,120
was Romania and we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Texas</font>

436
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:09,450
state agency we don't do business<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

437
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,040
Romania that's the context and that's

438
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,590
something that a vendor can't give you

439
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,720
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide for yourself so of</font>

440
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">course we did Red Alert oh my god you</font>

441
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,230
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's beginning out to Romania what</font>

442
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,310
are we going to do and then we

443
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,690
investigated and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

444
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:25,020
actually we were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> business with</font>

445
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,550
Romania and our<font color="#CCCCCC"> nessus professional feed</font>

446
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,740
had to be bought off a state contract

447
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,659
that we're the only provider was in

448
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,220
Romania so yeah we were updating our

449
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">nessus feed and everything was cool and</font>

450
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,040
you know we stood down from Red Alert

451
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:40,080
but again that's the context that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

452
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,270
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

453
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,659
need for yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody can give</font>

454
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:48,180
you so saying that they need additional

455
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,090
context to help make sense the CTI I'm

456
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,980
guessing they meant more details because

457
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,209
only they can decide whether those

458
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:03,300
details are useful and what they mean

459
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:05,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that wasn't me sufficient technology</font>

460
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,530
trade training for cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> security person</font>

461
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,090
and again the same six point three

462
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:13,500
percent which is probably one

463
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:17,699
organization that said now we're good so

464
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,110
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> never know templates templates</font>

465
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,070
is another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we came up</font>

466
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:25,290
from this study as a possibility so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

467
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,020
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing templates for filling</font>

468
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:33,659
out or you know what to share in

469
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:39,600
threaten now i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talking about</font>

470
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:41,730
templates like this you know here state

471
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,899
state the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction and velocity of</font>

472
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,179
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pew no we can't do that on I</font>

473
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,940
finally got threat but into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inter</font>

474
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:54,960
presentation I'm so excited not a

475
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,070
template like this and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a template</font>

476
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,540
like this I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how many people</font>

477
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:03,059
recognize this but this is this is a

478
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,889
representation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick schema but</font>

479
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,110
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we need templates</font>

480
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,370
for our descriptions of what you're

481
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,379
going to share so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the organization</font>

482
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,209
can take it back to their management in

483
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,950
their legal team and say these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

484
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,590
types of data we want to be sharing is

485
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,510
this okay can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just get a you know</font>

486
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,799
permission from here on out so that we

487
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,230
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming back to you</font>

488
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,850
every time we want to hear something so

489
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,260
if you can imagine I mean it's got nice

490
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,168
pictures that's good for management

491
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,230
management like as a manager I can say I

492
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:32,370
like pictures I'm not really sure what

493
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,080
that does anybody know what that

494
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:40,320
indicator one is it looks like a sea

495
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:45,139
sponge what is up that's a thumbprint

496
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:50,030
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know can you imagine</font>

497
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:51,960
talking to somebody about leverage TTP's

498
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,750
you know their eyes are going to glaze

499
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,400
over so we can't get too technical about

500
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,730
the template what I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

501
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,500
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like this if you report a</font>

502
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,820
phishing attack here are the sort of

503
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,610
things you could you could consider

504
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,439
sharing so that your report is useful

505
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,689
because we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have people who will</font>

506
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,260
submit something and say yeah we got a

507
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:16,799
phishing email well do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to tell</font>

508
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">us what it said you want to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us when</font>

509
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,990
you saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was attached to</font>

510
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,120
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take one of these to</font>

511
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,380
your management and say these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

512
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,559
things we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share we want to share</font>

513
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,260
the maps and they might say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we want</font>

514
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,168
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take out you know the most</font>

515
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,209
immediate

516
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,649
domain names or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

517
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:39,089
source domains and IPS usually nobody

518
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,859
has a problem with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

519
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:43,320
where the attack is coming from they

520
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,629
have nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fit the time range is</font>

521
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,009
really useful because if other members

522
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:49,678
want to look in their logs they need to

523
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:53,009
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to narrow it down and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

524
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,070
yeah we saw this last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

525
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:59,940
that's relevant now how we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

526
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,070
that connection where they found it so

527
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,969
for example our web filters caught this

528
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:08,218
or are<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSSP cottage or we found it</font>

529
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:10,139
already on our system those things are

530
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:12,149
important but sometimes organizations

531
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,218
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reveal what security</font>

532
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:16,199
technology they're using so they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

533
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:18,599
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that it would be helpful but</font>

534
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,579
sometimes they won't do it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

535
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,019
body the email the target recipients

536
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,269
sometimes they take those out because

537
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:26,339
they're very nervous<font color="#E5E5E5"> about especially if</font>

538
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,139
it was spearfishing they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

539
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:33,749
implication that yes our CFO fell for

540
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:35,939
that any attachments<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

541
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:37,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to when you default to email</font>

542
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,209
it's hard to share share attachments

543
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,429
especially malicious ones and threat

544
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,349
intelligence half of the threat

545
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,029
intelligence discussions end up going in

546
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:47,129
my spam folder for good reason because

547
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:50,759
they've all got like you know spam

548
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:52,019
strings in there so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

549
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a better you know a different</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">platform a different method for sharing</font>

551
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,570
malicious attachments because they're

552
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,479
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get stripped right out the</font>

553
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:03,029
impact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to know sometimes</font>

554
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:05,309
whether it worked and what happened

555
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:07,489
afterwards depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where it landed</font>

556
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,869
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kill chain where you stopped it</font>

557
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,729
we can know a little bit about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or we</font>

558
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:13,769
can know a lot so it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice if we</font>

559
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:17,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">could share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again they may want</font>

describing the kill chain chain stages

562
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,079
campaign or threat actors people like to

563
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:26,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about that sometimes but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

564
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,158
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really relevant they just want</font>

565
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to stop one of the most important</font>

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our organizations want to</font>

567
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:37,289
know about from threat intelligence

568
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:39,299
first and foremost it at us because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

569
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,829
it was targeted they guess the adversary

570

is probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more persistent</font>

571
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:45,210
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

572
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,490
the mount otherwise it was opportunistic

573
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,650
they just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clean up and</font>

574
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,179
back to work so that's one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

575
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,179
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

576
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,160
so any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this that can help them figure</font>

577
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:58,070
that out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

578
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally for each of these things is it</font>

579
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to know which company submitted</font>

580
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,530
this or does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all have to be anonymous</font>

581
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,350
or they say if it if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you know</font>

582
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,360
sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recipients or if you're</font>

583
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,669
sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the impact then we have</font>

584
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,139
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be anonymous so that's the other</font>

585
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,140
discussion that they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be having</font>

586
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,420
things get really complicated most of

587
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,149
these folks are happy to share what they

588
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,080
blocked it's like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we saw</font>

589
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:32,420
this it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get us we're good</font>

590
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,309
incidents not so much we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting</font>

591
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,110
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where some will call me up</font>

592
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,450
and say you can share this anonymously

593
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,939
we had this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infection it</font>

594
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,830
affected five<font color="#E5E5E5"> genes here's what we knew</font>

595
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,780
about the malware here's what it took to

596
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,730
clean it up and that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

597
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,750
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go but that is a very</font>

598
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:52,100
hard line to cross a lot of them don't

599
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,470
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their own tools and</font>

600
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,909
methods which is which is fair

601
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,350
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're sharing with a</font>

602
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,390
wider community and you don't know if

603
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,600
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out to the adversary</font>

604
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,190
they're worried about reprisals some of

605
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,689
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the threat analysts are working</font>

606
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,640
at a level where they really are

607
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:12,320
stopping bad guys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guys don't</font>

608
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:15,380
like it but the most important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

609
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,139
that their brand reputation is more

610
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,500
important than any liability or lack

611
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:24,440
thereof so I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> seas of people it</font>

612
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,660
was a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice effort but all of our</font>

613
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,300
all of our retailers are telling us they

614
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,559
don't care whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not liable</font>

615
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,110
that is not going to keep their brand

616
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,600
reputation intact and in fact there are

617
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,550
a lot of retailers who you know would

618
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,870
report more they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to law</font>

619
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,270
enforcement more because they really

620
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,070
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop these guys but they there's</font>

621
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,470
only so often that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to</font>

622
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,689
have their name associated with this

623
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,400
anywhere so they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick the really</font>

624
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,870
big cases that they want to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

625
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,360
they'll work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> law enforcement on</font>

626
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,678
that but they you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> will let the</font>

627
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,949
other ones go just because they don't

628
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,820
want to keep sticking their heads up and

629
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes they've come to me and said</font>

630
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,360
you know can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go on too long</font>

631
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">horseman on our behalf and I'm like I'm</font>

632
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not how it works you got to</font>

633
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,430
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an actual complaint so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

634
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,500
big problem you know legislating that

635
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,720
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not going to be liable for</font>

636
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,790
threat intelligence is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very nice but</font>

637
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:23,450
it's it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sufficient it's never</font>

638
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:30,020
going to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other problem is I'm</font>

639
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:31,780
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on a TLP rant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t.o.p is a</font>

640
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,120
great idea it started out really nice

641
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:38,330
the the problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are very</font>

642
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,909
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitions of an organization</font>

643
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">though for example is the retail I sack</font>

644
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:47,800
one organization which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> composed of</font>

645
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:51,470
retailers and the vendors who love them

646
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:54,050
or are we talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an organization</font>

647
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of each company are we talking about an</font>

648
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:59,690
organization a company plus their

649
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,820
service providers you know what is that

650
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,130
definition and any time something comes

651
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,470
in that's that's the classified as TLP

652
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,810
amber we have to have that conversation

653
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:11,300
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the about</font>

654
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:14,360
what what the range is of distribution

655
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're proposing here the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

656
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,250
peers and partner organizations whose

657
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:28,250
appear who isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know but I'm</font>

658
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:29,780
getting this answer all like no you

659
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:33,920
cannot share<font color="#CCCCCC"> this with the government</font>

660
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:36,050
not even once and that's that's a really

661
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">big problem because obviously we would</font>

662
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,970
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to work with DHS DHS</font>

663
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,490
will come to us and say you know can you

664
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,460
tell us can you survey your your

665
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,420
retailers and tell us what the top

666
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,850
malware strains are that they've seen

667
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,140
that's pretty you know pretty simple but

668
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:55,730
we've sent it out and there's like

669
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,220
crickets so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

670
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:01,400
opportunity that we are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

671
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out and work on the other problem</font>

672
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,740
which you may not have thought of but

673
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,740
it's definitely there

674
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:15,310
oh and and if there's anybody who

675
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:24,820
anybody who's offended by by swearing I

676
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:28,600
I apologize don't read his lips but the

677
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't fully</font>

678
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate this that there are two</font>

679
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:36,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons why in in and I sack the the</font>

680
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-user organizations of rear nervous</font>

681
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,730
about vendors first of all they don't

682
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,340
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pitched at which you know you</font>

683
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,500
can understand that that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but even</font>

684
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">if if you know the vendors are great and</font>

685
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,180
our contributing information and you

686
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,820
know not not speaking up when they say

687
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,150
oh we can help with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the other</font>

688
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,770
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in threat intelligence</font>

689
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,690
I've heard some complaints that some

690
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:02,200
commercial threatened tell vendors will

691
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:04,270
take intelligence that the members

692
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,600
contribute and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> package it and sell</font>

693
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:10,870
it in their own offerings without credit

694
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,240
and so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that reason some retailers</font>

695
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,409
say you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of great you</font>

696
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">know threat intelligence will share it</font>

697
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,390
with the members do not let the vendors

698
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:22,800
see it that's another barrier that we

699
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:27,120
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on because</font>

700
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:34,110
commercial threat intelligence is not I

701
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:36,100
need an adjective happy functional

702
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,870
whatever there's some really good things

703
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,669
happening out there but the commercial

704
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,760
interests are getting in the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

705
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,220
sharing so a very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> example use all</font>

706
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,650
seen the threat reports that come out

707
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,360
from vendors and sorry for threatened

708
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,280
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> thunder representatives out here</font>

709
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,689
but you know they will they will come

710
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say okay we're going to launch this</font>

711
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,440
new report we want to brief all of your

712
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,000
members under embargo well that's very

713
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,590
nice that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to brief us ahead of</font>

714
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,570
time so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get those indicators</font>

715
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,000
and start blocking and doing whatever it

716
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we do with them but do we really have</font>

717
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,780
to embargo this until you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ready to</font>

718
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">publish your great paper and do the</font>

719
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,190
press release<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the press tour and and</font>

720
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,720
all this kind of stuff in some cases

721
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a new</font>

722
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,250
fancy name for the malware strain it's

723
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,410
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we can't say your new fancy</font>

724
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,290
name until it comes out how are we

725
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,110
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

726
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,149
this is it like this one will know it's

727
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,629
not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one its kind of to the</font>

728
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:32,210
left all the you know these commercial

729
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,490
interests are really you know make it

730
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,870
difficult exclusivity is another one if

731
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're trying to make it as a threat and</font>

732
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,979
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor you need to have information</font>

733
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that nobody else has again that's</font>

734
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,850
completely contradictory to the idea of

735
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,530
sharing so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will share something</font>

736
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,899
with us and we'll go okay can we tell

737
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:53,690
our members will know okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you can</font>

738
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,910
share this one but that was from you

739
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,320
know like three weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but</font>

740
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:03,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you for</font>

741
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:05,960
free that's another problem marketing

742
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,150
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to convince a retailer</font>

743
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,730
to say yes they gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> us the Intel that</font>

744
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:13,400
helped save us especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font>

745
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:16,220
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in the headlines in in any</font>

746
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,230
time in the past you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't do</font>

747
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,480
that either and then of course sales you

748
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:24,740
understand you got to make sales but you

749
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,000
know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a bunch of vendors</font>

750
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,440
who are all competing with each other

751
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,730
and trying to fight for the same

752
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,100
potential customers trying to negotiate

753
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,690
that as the I sack in the middle of that

754
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,840
and trying to remain vendor-neutral is

755
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,100
another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to negotiate</font>

756
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,600
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know your commercial threat</font>

757
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,429
intelligence is going to go but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

758
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,230
know that there are so many dynamics

759
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,630
there that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting in the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

760
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:53,480
sharing that sooner or later we have to

761
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:57,160
address now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk for a minute</font>

762
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,160
about unstructured threat intelligence

763
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,110
because everybody is all about the

764
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:05,330
sticks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything this is a Picasso</font>

765
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,850
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it can apply really well to</font>

766
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,080
security so you know there's the threat

767
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,980
intelligence that's coming straight out

768
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,169
of the horse's mouth there's some

769
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,000
illumination that police stands for

770
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,880
visibility we're always looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more</font>

771
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,670
visibility into our environment there's

772
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,650
a broken pool and broken sword down here

773
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:30,230
maybe our IDs wet the bed I don't know

774
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:33,740
you this is probably auditor because

775
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,860
there's a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper you know so i</font>

776
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,720
think this this

777
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,610
speaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> personally and I hope it</font>

778
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,559
speak to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font>

779
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:44,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">get discussed that do not fit nicely</font>

780
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,809
into schemas and<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and all these</font>

781
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,380
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a lot of times we will get</font>

782
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:52,049
narrative reports of things so there's

783
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,980
an adversary they<font color="#E5E5E5"> started doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> account</font>

784
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:58,220
checking against account validation

785
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:02,100
automated against our<font color="#CCCCCC"> e-commerce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

786
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,540
they were coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from these IPS but as</font>

787
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,030
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they figured out that we saw</font>

788
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:08,520
them they ratcheted it down they started

789
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,480
to go low and slow they rotated through

790
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,239
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't reuse an IP</font>

791
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,418
any more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often than once a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> month that</font>

792
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,049
sort of thing does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fit into you know</font>

793
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:24,480
any level of stride exchange that you

794
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,220
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send through taxi or you know</font>

795
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything else machine to machine but</font>

796
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:32,189
it's incredibly valuable or the steps

797
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:35,219
that somebody is taking to commit paypal

798
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:39,270
fraud by setting going halfway through

799
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,918
the steps to set up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank account just</font>

800
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">long enough so that paypal will verify</font>

801
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,690
it and then abandoning it that's sort of

802
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of techniques and that sort of</font>

803
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,970
thing is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we exchange and</font>

804
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:53,279
it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very useful but there's no way</font>

805
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:56,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to really you know strip those out and</font>

806
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,470
just form them you know in indicators so

807
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,390
we're also having trouble trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

808
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,339
figure out how to archive that kind of

809
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,960
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> and usually it's a long email</font>

810
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,820
thread and somebody's throwing something

811
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,160
in somebody saying something else

812
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,440
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all together it's hard to</font>

813
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,500
do it anyway except maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pros</font>

814
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,460
report so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

815
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,680
we're probably never going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

816
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,109
this great utopia where things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

817
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,940
shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine-to-machine all over the</font>

818
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,950
world all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

819
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,470
responding like that just to everything

820
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,660
because a lot a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the best</font>

821
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,990
intelligence that we're on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

822
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:38,180
exchanging our stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stories don't</font>

823
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,180
fit into structure

824
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:46,920
and one more problem that we have is the

825
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,799
velvet rope problem everything I

826
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,349
mentioned before about about our members

827
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:54,239
not wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know contribute too</font>

828
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:56,220
much information to vendors because

829
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,309
they're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that creates</font>

830
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,470
a velvet rope you know that we'd really

831
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:04,710
like to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down another</font>

832
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,299
problem is that everybody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

833
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,680
anonymous when they share their info but

834
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:10,619
they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to be anonymous when</font>

835
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,118
you share your info and I can understand

836
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,759
that because the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they really</font>

837
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,829
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know the source especially the</font>

838
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">top level analysts want to know who is</font>

839
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:19,400
contributing because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

840
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,169
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're talking about</font>

841
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,329
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to go</font>

842
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">through everything they receive so if</font>

843
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,059
they're getting something from somebody

844
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:28,799
they know and trust and say yeah you

845
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:32,309
know they're really on top of it they'll

846
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:35,970
look at that first so that's another

847
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:37,589
problem how do you sift out groups of

848
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,439
people who want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

849
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:42,058
level the the threat analysts who are

850
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,039
working at this all day are going to

851
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:45,690
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different perspectives on what</font>

852
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,980
threat intelligence they're digging up

853
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:50,400
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to focus more threat</font>

854
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,779
actors on TTP's whereas the less

855
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,049
materials are going to be saying you

856
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:56,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">know just tell me what to block but you</font>

857
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:58,650
don't want to create elite groups where

858
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,209
nobody you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can't get in you</font>

859
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,349
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know somebody to get into this</font>

860
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:06,299
sharing group we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want that either</font>

861
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:10,589
so again this is a sociological sort of

862
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:12,180
thing it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's difficult one</font>

863
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:13,799
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are doing in the I sack is</font>

864
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,930
we have a group that is just for

865
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:18,239
full-time<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat analysts from from our</font>

866
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,220
member organizations it's not like hey

867
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,749
we like you we trust you were bringing

868
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,459
you and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say this is</font>

869
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:24,930
what you do all day and therefore we

870
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,460
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

871
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:30,299
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective and a different</font>

872
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,769
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attention you know to it to the</font>

873
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:33,059
discussion that's going on so at least

874
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:35,729
we're grouping it that way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

875
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:40,920
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make make sure that's fair but</font>

876
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:42,660
that's enough that's another problem so

877
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,400
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm saying is technology is</font>

878
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,129
not sufficient I don't want to dishonor

879
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,319
G but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just so many human</font>

880
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,670
aspects to this threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tell sharing</font>

881
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:53,430
that are not going to get addressed by

882
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,470
those so it would really be

883
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,470
nice if we could keep up with everything

884
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:01,828
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old antivirus model by just</font>

885
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:04,200
sharing it fast enough but this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

886
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:05,819
I don't think this is practical you're

887
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,348
welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and argue with me about</font>

888
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:09,410
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards I'd love to hear about it</font>

889
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:11,970
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different perspective on</font>

890
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:14,009
but not everybody likes sticks and taxi

891
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:17,459
some people like crits some people have

892
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,530
their own homegrown stuff as I mentioned

893
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">there a granular concern concerns about</font>

894
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,079
sharing indicators for every step in the

895
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,420
chain where you're sharing something

896
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,339
there's often a discussion about can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

897
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:33,000
share this indicator part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

898
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,890
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out or we'll okay we've</font>

899
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,970
gotten this far with our name but now if

900
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,549
you're going to share it outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

901
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:41,640
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to take our name often so</font>

902
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,200
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always that and then you know at</font>

903
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,578
the end of the day if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're which is</font>

904
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,640
apparently when a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things happen</font>

905
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,109
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day if you've watered</font>

906
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,970
everything down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where you</font>

907
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:53,430
can share<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with in the whole community</font>

908
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,558
is TLP green and you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

909
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,669
supposed to be public but it's okay if

910
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does kind of it it's probably much</font>

911
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,630
later like weeks later and it's watered

912
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,780
down to the point where it doesn't have

913
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:08,069
any useful details in it anymore and

914
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,920
again this is just my kind of cynicism

915
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:15,930
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect this is kind of where</font>

916
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:18,960
we're going now I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

917
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cyber pakka lips otherwise known as</font>

920
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:31,829
the cyber is coming for you so I don't

921
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">know how much I can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

922
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">it yet because i know the after reports</font>

923
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,598

924
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:40,290
been published let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say it was a</font>

925
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,500
very it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very devilishly clever</font>

926
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:49,680
scenario and it worked against the

927
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:51,000
things that we utility yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigating</font>

928
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,700
the types of attacks that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

929
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,079
expect so it was very well constructed

930
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,598
but i will talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about you know</font>

931
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the lessons that we that we learned so</font>

932
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,250
as things were virtually in smoking

933
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,760
heaps and there were holes and a rocket

934
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Mars blew up and things like that</font>

935
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,780
this was a scenario that was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

940
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:26,009
who took part in this exercise we found

00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,919
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that politics always plays</font>

942
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:30,869
a role everywhere there were groups

943
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,420
sitting at the same exercise table who

944
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:36,390
did not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk with each other and</font>

945
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,190
I'll do it no I'll do it no we're the

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,920
center of excellence<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this no we are</font>

the center of excellence for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

948
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,609
know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a government institution so</font>

949
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,530
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these rules that we have to</font>

950
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,000
follow and we have to normalize this

951
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,240
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything before we can get</font>

952
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,160
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you there was one portion of the</font>

part of the exercise at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of</font>

955
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:01,770
the three-day exercise I never heard

<font color="#CCCCCC">back from them not even an automated</font>

957
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:06,780
thank you for your submission will get

958
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:08,790
back to you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing but the really</font>

959
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,090
interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I that I found</font>

960
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:14,279
out that at the end is because of the

961
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,960
solution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found that we came</font>

962
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,080
across and by the way it was paypal that

963
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,170
that came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a solution that they</font>

964
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,580
have some really sharp guys there the

965
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,380
next step as soon as we brought it to

966
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,779
the US cert they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great you one</font>

967
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,550
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exercise is over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the really</font>

968
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,740
interesting important part would have

969
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,930
been following up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because what</font>

970
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:37,859
it was was we were going to need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

971
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:39,540
some code to everyone who is affected by

972
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">this but in such a way that the</font>

973
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,710
adversary wasn't tipped off because

974
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,500
otherwise they could set off um and

975
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:49,140
explode everything so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

976
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,730
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notify people who you have not</font>

977
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,400
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and never met who may not have</font>

978
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">a security group how are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

979
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,290
this figure out whether they can spell

980
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">PGP top them about whether they can use</font>

981
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:03,420
this on their own or whether you have to

982
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:05,609
stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a SAS to do it for them I think</font>

983
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have been the biggest challenge of</font>

984
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,700
the whole exercise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would have</font>

985
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">loved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue with that because I</font>

986
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that was the hard part how can we</font>

987
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this and how can we do it at scale</font>

988
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,020
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the other lesson that we</font>

989
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,740
learned is that government doesn't scale

990
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,960
they will

scale they cannot do the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

993
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,780
centralized work under the constraints

that we put them on as taxpayers and

995
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,740
respond as quickly as say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a paypal can</font>

996
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,780

999
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,980
be a lot more agile just because they're

1000
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,570
not under the same constraints and so

1001
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,310
it's going to be up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

1002
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:51,060

00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,840
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other and passing things</font>

1008
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference so that's kind of scary but</font>

1009
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:10,110
it's also you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting</font>

1013
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:21,390
a member but a security researcher will

1014
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,760
come to us and say we have files for a

1015
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:26,640
bunch of retailers you know data on

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,350
reshipping fraud or whatever transaction

files and you don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send</font>

1022
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,830
them out and you know publicly we try to

1023

email them about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get</font>

00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,960
typing into customer support forms on

1039
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,760
retailer websites and they'll come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more robust because again we</font>

send them stuff and then you know as I

1137
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:27,340
want to point out is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of a lot of</font>

1138
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,500
folks out there are automating their

1139
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:32,170
threat intelligence processing process

1140
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,720

you can possibly automate any of it

1148
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,760
especially if you've already gotten

1149
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,810
