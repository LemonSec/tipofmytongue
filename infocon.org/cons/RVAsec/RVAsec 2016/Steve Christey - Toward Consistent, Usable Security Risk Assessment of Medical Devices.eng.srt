00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,600
I'm Steve<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christy Kohli with The MITRE</font>

2
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,240
corporation I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking</font>

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about work with my mentor colleague</font>

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,769
penny chase also The MITRE corporation

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,750
and we want to see consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> and usable</font>

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,610
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk assessment for medical</font>

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,220
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're just in the beginning</font>

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,570
stages of this and so I'm going to talk

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit about how we are</font>

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,360
approaching the problem so first of all

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,910
though I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a very quick</font>

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,690
audience poll how many of you here<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">a showing hands how many of you here are</font>

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:00,030
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health care in one way or</font>

15
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,370
another ok cool how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you care</font>

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,630
about CBS s or risk or those kind of

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,880
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok how many of you are horrified</font>

18
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,460
by IOT security and that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,320
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right a lot of multiple hands</font>

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">here how many you came here for a nap ok</font>

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,110
I assume everyone who doesn't have their

22
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,060
hands raised is already half asleep and

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,720
then who here wants me to finish early

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:33,830
so they can get all the vendor giveaways

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:36,509
ok a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so let's get into</font>

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,849
medical devices surprise surprise you've

27
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,789
all heard medical devices can be

28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:44,580
insecure and why is that the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

29
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:46,740
like many other areas of IOT stuff used

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,140
to not be computerized used to not be

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to networks and now it's</font>

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,090
starting to happen much more heavily

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,929
greater reliance on computers these

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,240
things are being networked together

35
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,560
maybe in separate parts of networks but

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,589
they are being networked together on a

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,560
much more regular basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">are built using third-party components</font>

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:17,130
and third-party operating systems as

40
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:18,930
well and unlike classic IT devices the

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,569
medical devices themselves actually are

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,239
subject to regulations so that changes a

43
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:28,530
little bit of the risk analysis with

44
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,750
respect to that also there are wrinkles

45
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,660
within the regulation side of things

46
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,480
because

47
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,640
it can limit the ability to either patch

48
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,929
systems or to reconfigure them or

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">something along those lines however</font>

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:47,060
there is a very common<font color="#E5E5E5"> myth that health</font>

51
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">care providers sometimes hear from</font>

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare manufacturers about the</font>

53
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">inability to patch devices because that</font>

54
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:59,150
would force them to go and resubmit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

55
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,730
FDA for approval this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-standing</font>

56
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,130
myth it is pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a myth there are</font>

57
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,649
only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely rare cases where</font>

58
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,260
simply applying a security or

59
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,690
operational patch would<font color="#CCCCCC"> force some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

60
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,790
of re-evaluation so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

61
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,210
confusion out there about those kind of

62
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,280
things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with drugs and and</font>

63
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,260
medicine there are clinical trials for

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,570
treatment that can take years can be

65
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">very extensive there's no there's not</font>

66
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,980
really such a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case with</font>

67
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,230
medical devices there is a premarket

68
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,630
review and approval but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clinical</font>

69
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,750
trials are really generally very kind of

70
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:39,590
small and surprise surprise a few

71
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:43,340
manufacturers really have integrated

72
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,110
security testing into into their whole

73
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,980
processes and I'll touch a little bit

74
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,709
more on that later at the mitre

75
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,100
corporation we are working with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA</font>

76
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:59,510
and supporting them in in their vision

77
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,780
here which is a nice piece of buzzwords

78
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,560
I guess or so but what the FDA is really

79
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,540
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to build and foster a</font>

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">community driven approach that brings</font>

81
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,959
together lots of different kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

82
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,339
stakeholders so that community wide a

83
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,459
development of a shared risk assessment

84
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:22,250
framework can<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be done with the real</font>

85
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,190
goal of enhancing patient safety the

86
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,700
idea being to mitigate medical device

87
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,190
cyber security risk this is specifically

88
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:35,570
tasking that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA has taken on its</font>

89
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:38,480
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their charter in a sense when it</font>

90
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes specifically to preserving patient</font>

91
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,760
safety the timing of this has been

92
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,138
spurred on also however by<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

93
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,259
discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one</font>

95
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,180
Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font>

96
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,310
the other guy who found surprise

97
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,219
surprise a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hard coded</font>

00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:03,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">default passwords and so on and if you</font>

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,249
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the 90s all over again more</font>

101
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:09,770
or less it is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the FDA's</font>

102
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:13,789
role has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in this hole in this whole</font>

103
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">area has been to to provide some things</font>

104
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they've done recently is to provide</font>

109
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,330

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oppose did</font>

111
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:35,289
clarifications for that and recently

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,560
they also posted some post market

113
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:43,669
guidance for how medical devices should

114
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,389
be handled as part of this whole of

115
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:51,500
community approach that they have taken

116
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:53,779
they had a workshop<font color="#CCCCCC"> in October 2014 that</font>

117
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,319
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attended and then another</font>

118
00:05:53,779 --> 00:06:00,229
workshop in January of 2016 and at mitre

119
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,629
we've been supporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in activities</font>

120
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:05,000
such as those workshops as well so there

121
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a very there's a growing interest not</font>

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,810
only within industry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then different</font>

123
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,270
kind of stakeholders but the FDA is

124
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,990
taking a very active role but there's a

125
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,068
recognition that to solve these problems

126
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,219
we all really need to work together

127
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:23,180
across this diverse ecosystem of many

128
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:24,919
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of stakeholders the</font>

129
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,919
problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you about</font>

130
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,270
today is that when a vulnerability comes

131
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,529
out with respect to a medical device

132
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,938
there can be many different

133
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,029
interpretations and many different

134
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspectives of what that vulnerability</font>

135
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,659
really means you know if you're a

136
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:40,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">security researcher you found a</font>

137
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:43,669
vulnerability it's a really terrible

138
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:45,740
thing it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> hyped sometimes or maybe</font>

139
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,258
not but there's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

140
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,509
research the researcher point of view

141
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,599
generally is this is very bad you must

142
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,680
fix it and you must fix it now

143
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:58,519
manufacturers have stable development

144
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,090
processes recall is not necessarily as

145
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,040
easy

146
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,090
or replacement is not necessarily as

147
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,250
easy as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is for just simple software</font>

148
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,650
and they have to really decide how bad

149

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,229
devices there's the classic security and

183

there's this whole element of safety as

actually change actual dosage of fluid

infusion pumps work or at least some of

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,670
them is there are drug libraries that

302
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,590
include safety settings like what is the

303
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,229
minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount or the maximum amount or</font>

not exactly defense-in-depth there but

if you're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to modify the these</font>

isn't so bad or the likelihood may be

323
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,480

<font color="#E5E5E5">protect the devices from the rest of the</font>

them and then infect the rest of the

so that the hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> is protected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hospital that's doing certain kinds of</font>

337
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:28,780
ultimate risk may actually be fairly

338
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:32,960
minimal now for this particular case

339
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:36,860
this was something that led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a safety</font>

340
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,990
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the FDA which is not exactly</font>

341

literally a recall but more or less has

342
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,910
the effect of a recall there were

343
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,750
certain pumps that just simply could not

344
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:49,219
be updated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and could not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be fixed</font>

345
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,050
another aspect for this for this

346
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,420
particular issue as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

348
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,810
think

349
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:00,170
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interfaces Ethernet wireless</font>

350
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,959
and infrared so if you were relying for

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:05,959
example on infrared interfaces to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font>

352
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,640
your pumps but this vulnerability is

353
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,350
only accessible through the ethernet or

354
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,870
wireless then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't even</font>

355
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,630
vulnerable at all because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you weren't</font>

356
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,760
using that particular interface so there

357
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">are all of these different kind of</font>

358
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,350
considerations here another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example now</font>

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,699
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a regulated medical device</font>

360
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,400
but it's still something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very</font>

361
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,260
important to health care providers was a

drug cabinet this was released a little

me to hear can run on the order of a

technical vulnerability in here was

370
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,839
there was a extensive use of many

371
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,370
different third-party components and the

372

different third-party components or

376
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,480
something along those lines the actual

377
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,370
technical impact of that wasn't

378
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,929
necessarily clean or<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't necessarily</font>

379
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:09,399
clear because there were insufficient

details but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand one of the</font>

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential things that could</font>

382
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,069
be done would we'd actually open up the

383
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:20,149
drug cabinet doors and then you have

384
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:23,240
free access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of these drugs but if</font>

385
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,980
you caused a denial of service in the

386
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,870
case of defense in depth there were

387
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,990
manual overrides where you could just

388
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:32,270
manually use regular physical keys to

389
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,070
open up the cabinet so you couldn't do a

390
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,720
denial of service against the cabinet

391
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,659
and prevent people from getting at the

392
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,690
drugs in the case of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to open</font>

393
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,130
the drug cabinet doors well that

394
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,500
certainly seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something you'd</font>

395
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to prevent but in many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hospital</font>

environments they<font color="#CCCCCC"> recognize the</font>

397
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,428
importance of protecting these drug

398
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,040
cabinets and so they are in much more

399
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,020
physically lockdown regions usually it's

400
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,620
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some person can walk in off the</font>

401
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:04,010
street and then go and then go pick up

402
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,789
some drugs straight from the cabinet in

403
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:10,289
here

404
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:13,619
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a CBS s 10 as a sign</font>

405
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:15,720
by ics-cert but there's no direct impact

406
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:18,389
patient safety there may be some

407
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,999
indirect impacts if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know make it</font>

408
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,219
more difficult for people to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

409
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,139
drugs so to speak it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

410
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,600
concern to a hospital if they're worried

411
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:29,129
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> protecting their inventory unless</font>

412
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,978
there are behind the appropriate

413
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:33,168
physically secured environments so there

414
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:36,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">are these different kinds of</font>

415
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:38,669
complications and wrinkles that are a

00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:41,639
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit different than what</font>

traditional IT security risk assessment

418
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:47,340
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to consider so there's any</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">number of different impacts that could</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">kinds of devices that might have</font>

complete records for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the patient that</font>

that help with actually you know like

x-rays and so on actually analyzing what

430
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the patient's condition is monitoring</font>

431
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:18,869
and alerting making sure within within a

432
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:20,909
hospital environment that all the

433

devices are reporting information

434
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:25,169
appropriately if an emergency happens

435
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:28,139
then something might pop up at the

436
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">nurse's station so that they you know</font>

devices aren't you know necessarily

00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:41,639
directly attached to the patient but if

00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't hear an alarm when something</font>

443
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:46,408
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad is going you know is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

444
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,899

445
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:52,619
then that certainly has patient safety

446
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:54,689
implications perhaps indirectly one

447
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:57,178
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we saw in the Hollywood</font>

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,820
Presbyterian case the hack that the

ransomware hack that occurred recently

450
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,619
was at the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> least they had a lot of</font>

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,649
reduced<font color="#CCCCCC"> inefficiency they had to do a</font>

00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:09,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole lot more manual work as I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned before already medical devices</font>

454
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,799
in some cases can be used as pivot

455
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:16,440
points to then go and attack the rest of

456
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,240
the network privacy loss is a

457
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,580
significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> concern</font>

458
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,030
this is it may be at least partially

459
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:27,070
driven by HIPAA compliance a lot of a

460
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,910
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hospitals that we talked to the</font>

461
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">primary concern for the hospital boards</font>

462
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:37,570
was privacy versus security and whether

463
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:41,100
IT security or patient safety it was

464
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,149
privacy because of HIPAA compliance

465
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:47,260
financial loss is certainly another

466
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:49,690
consideration as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Inga</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and Becky</font>

467
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,180
did a good job I think explaining some

468
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,370
of that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there talk yesterday and then</font>

469
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,400
there's less quantifiable things as well

470
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,489
such as reputation damage or the

471
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,650
population wide lots of faith in<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

472
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,270
which might cause patients to know I

473
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,780
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use devices because they're</font>

474
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,930
afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being hacked and in the grand</font>

475
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,600
scheme of things you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want</font>

476
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,540
fud to prevent a patient from using a

477
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,360
device that gives them you know life

478
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:24,340
critical treatment so you note here that

479
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,860
many of these this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a different kind</font>

480
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">of math effectively than you might have</font>

481
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the finance world so that was one</font>

482
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,360
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I really found interesting</font>

483
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:37,150
about England and Becky's talk yesterday

484
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,439
was talking about some areas where you

485
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:43,840
might not traditionally have math where

486
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,310
there might be some similar kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

487
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,770
attributes or something along those

488
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,290
lines that would be measurable in some

489
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,450
kind of way and yet you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

490
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,879
get you know what is it how would you

491
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,710
quantify when you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reboot a</font>

492
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,840
patient or you lose a patient or

493
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,490
something along those lines so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

494
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of different kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenges</font>

495
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:06,850
that are faced the takeaway from from

496
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:10,570
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problem space really is is</font>

497
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,399
that it seems more so than in than in

498
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:17,950
some other industries that environment

499
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters and CBS s as it exists at</font>

500
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,700
least the raw technical scores there's

501
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,730
very clearly no direct relationship

502
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,980
between the technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> cvss score and</font>

503
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,680
what the actual impact of patient safety

504
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,180
is going to be and yet this is the

505
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're trying to work</font>

506
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:39,250
so then what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that you want in a in</font>

507
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:43,570
a good scoring method that might take

508
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:47,050
into account health<font color="#E5E5E5"> care so you want</font>

509
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,669
certainly minimum complexity you wanted

510
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,280
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be usable by practitioners</font>

511
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,810
and when I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> practitioners i'm not</font>

saying security personnel at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,840
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> security personnel but people</font>

might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fluent with insecurity</font>

517
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,390
ideally we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be usable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

518

525
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,330
would be flexible for different clinical

environments that can vary vary widely

527

and it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible for</font>

528
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,980
different device classes as well

529
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,900
something that performs a sonogram has a

530
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,890
very different threat model and a very

531
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:45,040
different impact to patient safety as an

532
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:50,140
MRI might or as an infusion pump might

533
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:52,870
or a pacemaker one of the key features

534
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of metrics in general is repeatability</font>

535
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,610
you want different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to use the</font>

00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,760
metric and be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

539
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:12,280
something out there and one feature that

540
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:14,740
I think CBS s provided which is very

541
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,100
useful but but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately about the</font>

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:21,490
number itself is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for metrics like</font>

543
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:24,159
CBS s at least provided a framework in

544
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:26,170
almost a language for discussing certain

545
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,690
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that would go into</font>

546
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,570
the risk assessment and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if</font>

547
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,580
disagreements would come up it would

548
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,439
still help to focus the discussion on

549
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,000
where the disagreements were and at

550
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,440
least try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get people centered around</font>

551
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,300
a common language so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

552
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">different kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of features for what it</font>

553
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking for that</font>

could<font color="#E5E5E5"> hel</font>

bus with conducting risk assessment for

556
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:54,490
medical devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what we did was</font>

557
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,550
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> then looked at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few different kinds</font>

558
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:01,350
of frameworks so one of them that comes

559
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:03,580
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> safety world is hazard analysis</font>

560
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,490
the thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing with hazard</font>

562
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,360
a well established practice and it's the

language<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the practice that</font>

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,300
really its associated with cwe if you're

familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the common weakness</font>

594
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,350

certain brings in certain elements that

596
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:44,139
may be of concern and of use to us and

597
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,970
then also for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those in the in the</font>

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,330
finance world especially there's the

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:52,410
fair methodology heavily adopted by

today that about the

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:05,320
yeah there's a open fair there's an open

604
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:07,750
source version of it basically so how

605
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,250
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are familiar enough with CBS</font>

606
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:14,200
s to know that temporal and

607
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:16,210
environmental portions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's see at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the time here on hold I'll go by here in</font>

609
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,669
a moment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our our basic approach</font>

610
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">really is to try and adapt CBS s and</font>

611
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:27,250
bring it into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare environment</font>

612
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,519
considering things such as what

613
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:34,330
compensating controls may exist within

614
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:36,779
within the hospital considering the the

615
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:40,120
negative impact that could occur and

616
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:43,750
also trying to consider in some ways the

617
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,059
kind of threats that occur that are

618
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,860
likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to occur or maybe not likely to</font>

619
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:51,000
occur but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the threats</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

620
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:54,760
happen within the healthcare environment

621
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,889
because of limitations of CBS s 2.0 we

622
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,158
are really concentrating on CBS s<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

623
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:04,240
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh and one of the main one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

624
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,889
main benefits for CBS s 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not only do</font>

625
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,740
they have they have the confidentiality

626
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:12,340
integrity and availability requirement

627
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,620
which is you know a normal aspect of the

628
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,510
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> the environmental score with</font>

629
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:21,549
CBS s version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 but you can basically</font>

630
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,408
specify within the environmental portion

631
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:27,158
certain criteria that would allow you to

632
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:29,320
modify the the base score within the

633
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:30,549
context of CBS s version<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the base</font>

634
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,740
score was something that could never

635
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:36,190
really be modified and yet there's a

636
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,960
recognition within CBS s<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 that</font>

637
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,210
sometimes the environment really

638
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:45,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually changes how you interpret this</font>

639
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:47,529
otherwise non changing based score there

640
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,649
are also some elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to focus on too much at</font>

644
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:04,000
the moment given some time constraints

645
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:08,439
here one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big things out of CW RAF</font>

or craft is the the realization<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

the technical impacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these errors</font>

651

more or less anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can think of can</font>

652

be described in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this small set of eight</font>

different eight different impacts

00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:31,659
modifying data reading data causing

655
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:33,908
certain variations of denial of service

656

being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to execute programs or</font>

commands hiding activities all that kind

658
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:44,350
of stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an important realization</font>

659
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:48,129
because what the craft what craft does

660
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:51,279
is it allows you to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a context</font>

661
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,519
for the business to<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe in business</font>

662
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,860
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the what these technical</font>

663
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:02,010
impacts would what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact would be</font>

664
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:04,479
on the business and so for example

665
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,240
there's this notion of vignettes it's

666
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,070
almost like a scenario so in this case

667
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,049
it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example vignette for let's say a</font>

668
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">web a shopping cart because we all know</font>

669
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:17,230
the web and we all love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shop whether</font>

670
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,699
we admit it or not perhaps the notion

671
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,700
being that you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eight different</font>

672
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,799
technical impacts on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand side</font>

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">assign a weight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based on how important</font>

674
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,049
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you in your business if a</font>

675
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:31,830
vulnerability is found that has that

676
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:34,179
negative technical impact along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

677
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:38,610
business-oriented explanation for why

678
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:38,610
that impact is a particularly bad thing

679
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:45,460
so one one<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're looking</font>

680
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">at is of one of our main approaches is</font>

681
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,440
to borrow this notion from<font color="#CCCCCC"> craf of these</font>

682
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:53,590
vignettes with these kinds of technical

683
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,809
impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> scorecards to then go and define</font>

684
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:59,408
new vignettes with new technical impact

685
00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:01,899
score cards for medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices and</font>

686
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:05,289
perhaps from different perspectives so

687
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:09,340
for example if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you care only about</font>

688
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:10,840
physical safety in your particular risk

689
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,480
analysis that you're conducting right

690
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,600
now and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time being you want to</font>

691
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">ignore the privacy implications then no</font>

692
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,969
matter what data gets red maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

693
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's credentials but pretty much reading</font>

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,350
data you don't care

695
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,600
within the context of doing a physical

696
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,060
safety analysis now of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

697
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,980
always necessarily that easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

698
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,379
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> read credentials maybe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

699
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,380
lead to being able to execute code or

700
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:41,500
commands so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some complications</font>

701
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:44,170
here but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get the sense here</font>

702
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,880
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scorecard is like and intended</font>

703
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:50,010
to do to reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

704
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:53,050
prioritization and yet to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

705
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:55,840
disassociate the business people<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

709
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,909
all those different kinds of

00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,430
vulnerabilities they can all be

711
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:09,610
described in terms of these eight

712
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,870
technical impacts so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one way</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can really connect the</font>

accordingly adjusts a<font color="#E5E5E5"> witch witch then</font>

adjust the values within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CWS s</font>

scoring engine itself which then

727
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:06,280
generates more business-oriented risk

728
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:08,860
metrics so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using c WS s</font>

729
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,450
directly but we're borrowing the spirit

of some of this kind of work

731
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:19,950
and so the scenario that that we

732
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:21,210
anticipate building towards is let's say

733
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,240
you have a vulnerability that gets

734
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,150
discovered it's published as<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE winds</font>

735
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,260
up being<font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned we generate some kind</font>

736
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:34,980
of vector in a CWS s style that also

737
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:39,270
then gets fed any number of we find<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

738
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:42,540
appropriate vignette for the appropriate

739

HDO environment and the type of device

740
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:49,560

741
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:53,419
adjustments to<font color="#E5E5E5"> RCW SS score and that can</font>

742
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,770

746
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,649
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work we still need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do in that</font>

747
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that area how does this all tie in to</font>

748
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:14,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the FDA and its its guidance one of the</font>

00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:26,339
a final version at a later point they've

753
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,658
received three months of comments and so

754
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,620
they're processing those<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

755
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,929
comments but the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is is in</font>

756
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:37,379
part of that guidance to manufacturers

757
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:40,580
is to really assess how exploitable is

758
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:43,529
the vulnerability in the first place and

759
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,418
additionally how do you directly assess

760
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,330
what the security what the severity

761
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:51,509
impact is to health<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's some</font>

762
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,980
kind of continuum that involves also

763
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:57,360
this notion of controlled or

764
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:59,370
uncontrolled risk more or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less touching</font>

765
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,520
on elements such as is the issue even

766
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:05,069
patchable do existing controls either

767
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:09,150
within the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> or within the</font>

768
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:12,710
manufacturer exist that help to minimize

769
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,710
the safety impact

770
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:21,790
and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the work that we're</font>

771
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:24,340
doing with with adapting<font color="#E5E5E5"> CBS s as well</font>

772
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:28,930
as leveraging particular elements of CWS

773
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:32,170
s this list on the left hand side is the

774
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,759
notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where different parts of the</font>

775
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:37,590
work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're touching on can feed</font>

776
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">into FDA's post-market guidance and how</font>

777
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,590
manufacturers can interpret and use it

778
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,859
so we have the eight different kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

779
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:46,960
technical impacts which may have strong

780
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,820
associations with the hazards analysis

781
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,970
the more safety oriented hazards

782
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:54,460
analysis which then can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

783
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:56,620
some notion of the severity impact to

784
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,690
health that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA touches on in its</font>

785
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,410
document there are certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements</font>

786
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,720
within CBS s and C WSS that touch on the

787
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:08,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">notion of vulnerability exploitability</font>

788
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,980
as FDA defines it and then there are

789
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,910
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements of CWS s itself that</font>

790
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">really get into controls that may help</font>

791
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:20,830
with minimizing or reducing the risk to

792
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:25,660
what the FDA calls essential clinical

793
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:27,610
performance there's a number of

794
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">different challenges though that we're</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face in doing this one of them</font>

many many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of devices</font>

799
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:44,380
it's shocking you don't want to create

800
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:46,450
these vignettes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every single kind of</font>

802
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,049
are different classes of devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

803

have certain kinds of functionality

804
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,670
maybe so maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat things up a</font>

805
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,700
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit higher level or maybe we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning stage of this work there's</font>

809
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,520
also the more let's the classic<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

810
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,490
about what's the right level of

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,550
abstraction for dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

812
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:15,129
vulnerabilities so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

gave you there were fourteen hundred and

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty three vulnerabilities reported</font>

816
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,270
you don't want to be doing any kind of

817
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,490
risk assessment necessarily on each one

818
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:28,538
of those individual vulnerabilities but

819
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:30,098
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand they were 77 of</font>

823
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,029
another another question or another

824
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:42,759
thing that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be wrestling with is</font>

825
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:45,130
this notion of can you provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:48,009
business value context multiple

827
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:50,469
technical score cards that reflect

828
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:51,880
different prioritization that there may

829
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:54,400
be for the hospital or for the

830
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,229
manufacturers such as one part maybe

831
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,719
they really care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about HIPAA compliance</font>

832
00:37:56,229 --> 00:38:01,660
whereas another part may care primarily

833
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:04,509
about patient safety how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we manage</font>

834
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,279
those different perspectives you can't

835
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:08,859
combine all those into a single score

836
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:10,689
that much is very clear but do we have

837
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:13,569
to create entirely different vignettes

838
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:19,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">for each of these maybe and we will find</font>

839
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:20,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out in in the end run it's not</font>

840
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:22,269
necessarily even clear that the approach

841
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:25,499
that we're taking it's not necessarily

842
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:28,359
certain that we will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

843
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:31,479
influence or feed inappropriate elements

of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CBS s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> version 3 environmental</font>

845
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:36,879
score maybe that's still not enough

846
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:39,729
input to give the kinds of results<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

847
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,169
can be validated and acceptable to all

848
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:45,038
of the different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stakeholders</font>

849
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:47,859
may be relative to medical devices and

850
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,799
patient safety analysis maybe CBS s

851
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:55,689
version 3 is not necessarily sufficient

852
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:58,689
we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet but we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started to</font>

853
00:38:55,689 --> 00:39:01,419
talk to first who<font color="#CCCCCC"> owns CBS s and we will</font>

854
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:04,419
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking with them and if</font>

certainly be letting them know another

another challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we really deal</font>

with an itouch a little bit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

859
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:19,209

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next you know the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heartbleed</font>

heartbleed because it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

866
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:32,650
right you hear about heartbleed and one

867
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:36,308
of the first questions you might ask

868
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:38,380
yourself in a hospital context relative

869
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the security of your device's is</font>

870
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,770
which of my devices

871
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:47,130
and have the vulnerable versions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

872
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">SSL it would be really nice if you knew</font>

873
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,090
on your device what the Bill of

874
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,680
Materials was what third-party

875
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,650

were what their versions were and so on

877
00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:00,810
and yet medical device manufacturers are

878
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:03,420
generally reluctant to provide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

900
00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:00,090

even be in use the affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> API function</font>

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,270
interacting with trusted components or

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,879
only interacting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> components that an</font>

attacker simply can't touch or influence

and so in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CBS s score at</font>

910
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:31,350
libraries may be over inflating the risk

911
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,290
or in some cases under inflating right

912
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:35,490
when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a denial of service</font>

913
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,710
suddenly that's really important if it's

914
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,140
in a device that actually is controlling

915
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:45,360
or otherwise influencing patient's

916
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:47,730
health directly so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

917
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,080
good chunk of challenges that come in

918
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,200
play with respect to third-party

919
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,200
components

920
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:57,950
we're not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

921
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:03,030
thankfully I wouldn't like the pressure

922
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:05,609
and in one thing that we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> at mitre in</font>

923
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:09,510
these kinds of efforts which is very

924
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:11,940
much in tune with how the FDA takes this

925
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,710
whole of community approach is we

926
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,920
brought in a pretty diverse set of

927
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,650
stakeholders not exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tiger team</font>

928

but a very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group of with</font>

approximately a dozen a dozen members

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,300
and we just kicked it off a few weeks

<font color="#E5E5E5">ago this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of our road shows so to</font>

932
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,970
speak to engage with even more people

933
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:35,240
but with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our working group we</font>

934
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">have people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from manufacturers</font>

00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:50,130
academia and some government agencies

939
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:52,080
not not just FDA but some other agencies

940
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:57,570
as well that have a lot of interest in

941
00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:01,410
this space with that working group we're

942
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically working very heavily over this</font>

943
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:07,920
over this summer especially to work on

951
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:31,950
this summer why infusion pumps they're

impacts a lot of past work has been done

955
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,590
on infusion pumps some of the

956
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,330
vulnerabilities that have been

957
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered or in the infusion pumps and</font>

are actually even safety and hazards

analysis models available that deal with

960
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:54,030
infusion pumps so just due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their</font>

ubiquity and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> availability of other</font>

963
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,270
an important device class to start with

<font color="#E5E5E5">we certainly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan on expanding to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

969
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,740
engaging much more actively and directly

this approach again I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a whole</font>

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,790

<font color="#E5E5E5">would make a good metric in this context</font>

and one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the metrics</font>

976
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,690
certainly is to be acceptable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

stages but that is certainly one of the

wanting end goals if if all of this
