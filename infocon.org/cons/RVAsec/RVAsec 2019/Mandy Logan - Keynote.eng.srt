1
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:33,480
all right so I now want to introduce our

2
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,610
keynote speaker which there we go

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,760
introduce our keynote speaker mandy

4
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,580
logan following a series of five strokes

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,739
and major head injuries mandy is no

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,599
longer in the construction engineering

7
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,480
industry she used her life hacking

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,650
prowess from a non-traditional

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,870
background to re-establish neural

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,440
control using her electrical system her

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,949
tongue against her teeth and yeah and so

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,400
now as a happy dyslexic autistic person

13
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:06,090
she's pursuing all things fo SEC with an

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,710
emphasis on incident response pressing

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,470
forward trying to improve lives of

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,119
InfoSec professionals long-term ethical

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,010
neuro tech for those unable to express

18
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,430
themselves to their own satisfaction she

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,229
enjoys art travel naps speaking

20
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,310
continuum broaden her own recovery and

21
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,070
good people

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,770
Mandy's always hopes to be half the

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,479
person that her service dog Trevor is he

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,969
helped her relearn to walk we almost had

25
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,369
Trevor come with us but he didn't make

26
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,259
the trip this time but I first heard

27
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,270
about Mandy through my friend Paul acid

28
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,689
oriented security weekly he shared with

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,249
me the story it was really inspirational

30
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:43,048
so I'm really thrilled to have Mandy

31
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:46,158
here today so please help me welcome to

32

[Applause]

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,430
good morning everyone

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:14,510
I really want to take a second and just

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:18,740
say hello and thank you I mean Thank You

37
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,209
Darby a sec to Jake Chris Karen the

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,170
vendors and sponsors and then to

39
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:28,070
everybody that is here I feel like this

40
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,899
is such a fantastic opportunity that we

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,079
get to come together for a shared

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,070
interest I mean we all have interest in

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,410
incident response or its cybersecurity

44
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:40,390
any part of information security that

45
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:43,460
you happen to be interested in and yet

46
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:47,390
we are so much more than just our jobs

47
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:50,510
or just our titles so today we're going

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:55,549
to expand more on that this is not a

49
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:57,829
technical talk 15 your guns and your

50
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,670
purpose I titled this courage from as a

51
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:04,130
node a inside and notice that it's not

52
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,899
from inside a node a this is not talking

53
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,120
about when you're actually in your team

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,250
or doing those things or an you locate a

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,160
breach but from actually experiencing a

56
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,160
complete zero day internally

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,959
you

58
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,170
Hey

59
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,340
so as I noted this is a deeply personal

60
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:40,810
talk I don't think that's a problem

61
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:45,640
considering that I am a person and every

62
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,790
single one of you is a person whatever

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,109
you are internally is what you bring to

64
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,269
your team it's what you bring to your

65
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,310
career it's what drives your goals and

66
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,040
your plans and your passion so

67
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,040
previously I did work in more

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,560
construction engineering and all a lot

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,730
of things all construction related now I

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,760
am passionate about technology

71
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:13,590
especially technology for autistic

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,988
children autistic nonverbal people and

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,320
for the community the info set community

74
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:24,340
and I'm very big and interested in

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,190
equality there's a strong push for there

76
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,760
to be more women in technology

77
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,560
previously when I was in construction

78
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,310
there was a push for there to be more

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,830
women in construction I would like to

80
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,540
share this little statistic because me

81
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,650
coming from a construction background

82
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,880
and now being disabled I feel like we

83
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,049
hear a lot about well there need to be

84
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,380
more women we need more different

85
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,510
diversity you need more inclusivity and

86
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,650
what I did in the construction world it

87
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,419
was three percent female in InfoSec what

88
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,380
I've heard is varying terms around 21 to

89
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:01,840
24 percent female and I see an

90
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,270
incredibly broad base of very good

91
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,119
hearted people who are actively and

92
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,430
willingly accepting of any and all

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,740
people who want to pursue information

94
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,740
security so here's a principle that I

95
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,450
always have gone by no matter who cuts

96
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,040
your check or how you spend your hours

97
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:27,659
you work for yourself you are your own

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,669
best employee you are your own best boss

99
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,740
so even if you make no money even if you

100
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,159
fail at what you were trying to do and

101
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,030
you face setbacks you're still working

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,500
for you

103
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,359
all of those that

104
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,810
setbacks all of those problems that you

105
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,570
face are part of you crafting you so I'm

106
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,610
going to touch on a pretty massive time

107
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,770
whenever I was not making any money I

108
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:58,480
failed at everything that I tried to do

109
00:05:50,770 --> 00:06:00,070
and I faced numerous setbacks I'd like

110
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,670
you to take a few seconds and consider

111
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:07,780
this question have you ever had a

112
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:10,660
serious close call those moments when

113
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,169
you go wow that could have gone much

114
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:17,970
differently or yeah I might have lost

115
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:24,549
everything if that had gone differently

116
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:27,910
well I wasn't lucky it wasn't just a

117
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:34,120
close call it was absolutely worst case

118
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:35,290
scenario again and again and again as it

119
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,390
says on the screen

120
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,390
I was wiped to the abilities of a

121
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:47,320
six-month-old so if you want to talk

122
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:50,590
about a complete reset pretty much being

123
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,800
human and being lightly alive but being

124
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,500
nothing of what you were previously

125
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,530
that's what I encountered and here I'm

126
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,760
going to ask that you recognize that

127
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:06,340
because i minimized recovery time and i

128
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,120
hacked my way through certain aspects of

129
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,609
it it does not mean that it was a lesser

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,999
impact or that I skipped any step in

131
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,649
recovery I think sometimes as

132
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,239
to think well they bounced back Errol I

133
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,679
saw them doing this in a few weeks or

134
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,628
this in a few months or something and

135
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:25,068
yet we need to have the compassion and

136
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:31,449
understanding that when people are going

137
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:34,309
through things it is it is never

138
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:42,249
compassionate or appropriate to minimize

139
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:44,539
what they are going through okay here

140
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:47,449
these are some of the things that I've

141
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:49,789
faced I would like you to look through

142
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:53,089
this list and find a couple of things

143
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:57,099
that you identify with as you can see

144
00:07:53,089 --> 00:08:01,099
there's psychological emotional physical

145
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:06,259
learning disabilities family situations

146
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:09,308
abuse poverty low self-esteem there have

147
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,569
been many many things that I have faced

148
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:14,389
so find those couple of things that

149
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,909
really resonate with you because in

150
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,949
going through all of those every single

151
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:21,169
thing that I've overcome the one

152
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:25,159
underlying principle to them all is they

153
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:27,378
all took courage so with what you are

154
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,959
facing what you identify with and how

155
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:32,558
you want to handle it it takes that

156
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,558
courage

157
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,289
so we're discussing some pretty heavy

158
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,069
stuff right here but ultimately

159
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:45,439
understand that my objective is we are

160
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,840
going to highlight how safe we genuinely

161
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,140
are now we talk about security a lot

162
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,000
right discuss security constantly and

163
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,270
what we're looking for is it not a

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,450
feeling it's a feeling of safety so I

165
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:02,449
would like you to look at my experience

166
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,410
as not the what ifs of oh my god that

167
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,970
could happen to me

168
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm here to say this doesn't have to

169
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,550
happen to you but if you're going to

170
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,890
give time to what if ifs then please

171
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,020
look at the what ifs of what if this

172
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,420
never ever happens to another person in

173
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,699
the world how great would that be what

174
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,099
would be the impact if it never had to

175
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,190
happen again look for the positive what

176
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,860
ifs and look at the fact that I am Here

177
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:33,470
I am standing I'm talking I'm breathing

178
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm generally comprehending that even in

179
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,410
worst case scenario you do have what it

180
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:44,180
takes to get through and thrive

181
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,949
afterward the world afterward so even if

182
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,239
you want to look at it besides just how

183
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,910
safe we are you can look at how

184
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,790
resourceful we are how capable we are

185
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,790
how inherently intelligent we are

186
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,399
you

187
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,750
so yes I was wiped to barely being able

188
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:13,410
to breathe barely being alive at all and

189
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,880
still look at your team's look at your

190
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,959
employees look at your families your

191
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,670
friends and then yourself even when you

192
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,829
are facing struggles or you have

193
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:27,540
setbacks humans rule we are still doing

194
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,519
fantastically well so here's a brief

195
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,779
timeline for the talk we're going to

196
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,570
have a video it and then we will discuss

197
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,640
the life before the Oh Day or the

198
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,950
injuries and all that what happened then

199
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,410
and then from the Oh day to the time of

200
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,180
the video how I hacked my recovery what

201
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,579
were the starting principles because

202
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,670
those elements of capability those

203
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:53,219
elements of my work history my

204
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,769
background and then courage were what

205
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,660
came together in order to facilitate a

206
00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:03,329
very fast recovery so ever discuss my

207
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,390
guns and purpose meaning why I lived

208
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,859
then the challenges some of the hacking

209
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,959
some of the reverse engineering I did

210
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,660
and finally we'll discuss some of the

211
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:16,550
resources that I can hand over to you

212
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,800
that helped me so before we begin

213
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,859
breathe take this moment we're gonna let

214
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,170
the outside world be completely outside

215
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,529
breathe know that your guns and your

216
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,060
purpose are already with you this isn't

217
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,260
something else you have to go search out

218
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:37,800
they're already in you and always do

219
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,130
what you can where you are with what you

220
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,130
have

221
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,469
you

222
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:17,160
it's July 16

223
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:17,160
I am trying and

224
00:12:23,590 --> 00:13:21,150
I don't know this this the sound coming

225
00:12:33,190 --> 00:13:21,150
from overcome a hit and even make words

226
00:13:33,750 --> 00:14:01,020
here Craig's really bad pain in my left

227
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:28,310
side and my left brain especially in the

228
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:39,709
back and the whole brain feels slow and

229
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:51,060
fatigued I'm sitting crossly

230
00:14:39,709 --> 00:15:02,160
on the bed because it's more stable to

231
00:14:51,060 --> 00:15:07,910
me it's either this or laying flat but

232
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:13,709
if I lay flat right now since everything

233
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:25,310
is bending so much

234
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:33,888
I won't also be able to record this

235
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:33,888
right now my left side

236
00:15:35,050 --> 00:16:05,020
doesn't seem to be there if I don't look

237
00:15:46,340 --> 00:16:05,020
at it even my head there's great Bell

238
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:21,640
doesn't seem it feels like a black hole

239
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:51,250
like I was just nothing there

240
00:16:21,640 --> 00:17:03,430
if I were to send right now I would not

241
00:16:51,250 --> 00:17:14,140
know where I am or where my side is who

242
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:20,598
brain hurts so badly and this feels like

243
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:21,950
it's killing me to try to

244
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:29,230
[Music]

245
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:29,230
thing or make words

246
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,759
[Music]

247
00:17:52,790 --> 00:18:12,159
I had another little documentation on

248
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:17,510
the busyness and internal I saw

249
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:22,670
definitely fill it is say this is Sunday

250
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:28,750
the 21st of September I went to the

251
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,750
emergency room on Friday the 19th and

252
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:44,350
palpitations and dizziness or incredibly

253
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,760
intense then got worse and worse as time

254
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:53,929
went on and day but it is occurring it

255
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,780
heard lightly yesterday yesterday is

256
00:18:53,930 --> 00:19:01,820
still had major problems with speech it

257
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:09,070
was about a quarter or a third of this

258
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:15,110
speed and with a very strange stuttering

259
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:19,159
and like mouth shaking thing that I've

260
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:26,290
never experienced the first time was

261
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:44,560
Friday in the ER so right now I'm

262
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:47,540
sitting up in a wheelchair it's

263
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:56,610
especially

264
00:19:47,540 --> 00:20:01,290
trying to look to the side it's like my

265
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:12,389
eyes are rolling or flipping back and

266
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:16,379
forth and I feel this mopping or I can

267
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:19,710
look for cold response through my chest

268
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:28,370
it's not just centered in my heart right

269
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:33,930
now and into the chest cavity standing I

270
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:38,790
do tend fall over and then three we

271
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:44,000
wanted to figure out how to stop if it's

272
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,000
physical following work just in my brain

273
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:58,010
it's like that looking down or up into

274
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,010
brick real vision makes it worse

275
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,570
you

276
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:17,090
okay so those two videos want you to

277
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:20,480
think back on because those videos were

278
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:23,418
taken at extremely high functioning

279
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,679
moments that was completely out of the

280
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:32,809
ordinary and say like the first video I

281
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:35,540
had spent approximately well at that

282
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:37,928
time I spent 23 and a half hours a day

283
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,149
in dark silence laying flat on my back

284
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:44,590
that's how it had been for at this point

285
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,419
almost two years there was no

286
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,790
distraction there was no TV there was no

287
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:52,130
music there was no reading there was no

288
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,668
texting there was no talking to anyone

289
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,990
else

290
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:59,570
those weren't possible so I think from

291
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:03,910
like the first video I had spent three

292
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:08,000
solid days trying to figure out words in

293
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:10,000
order to put them together and that was

294
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,700
done with just laying in dark silence

295
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,340
barely eating apparently doing anything

296
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,360
else them not moving me nothing so that

297
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:24,020
I could try I was trying so hard to get

298
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,668
words across to the doctors and we'll go

299
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,260
a little bit more into that but think

300
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,809
about it like you're looking for help

301
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,020
from these experts but every time they

302
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,740
walk in you are laying there completely

303
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,360
unable to move to talk to do anything

304
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,730
who else knows what's going on inside of

305
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,709
you while that's happening so it was a

306
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,690
life-or-death thing that I figure out

307
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,760
communication and that I figure out

308
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,130
communication and how to get my brain

309
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:54,230
and body and all of my parts to start

310
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,880
communicating together between the first

311
00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:01,190
video and the second video that were

312
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:03,860
shown here these were doing I had made a

313
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,700
lot of progress but for the first video

314
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,070
I had I pushed too hard I had major step

315
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,960
backs and that actually impacted to

316
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,928
where I had another event that caused

317
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,880
complete paralysis on my left side which

318
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:17,460
I had not been dealing with quite the

319
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,130
same

320
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,779
or so then we're looking now have a

321
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,960
whole new set of issues because a

322
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,880
different type of injury had occurred

323
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,799
partly because of having medication that

324
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,450
was incorrect that started causing

325
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:38,700
internal chemical burns between those

326
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:43,620
two videos I spent about 33 days and a

327
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:48,570
level-3 locked psychiatric ward the I

328
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:51,928
was so suicidal that it was just a cold

329
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,689
hard fact to me there was it was

330
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:58,500
completely illogical to try to continue

331
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:01,169
there was nothing else to pull from I

332
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,260
will say that I am grateful for the

333
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:05,880
psychiatric help for the care I feel

334
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,279
like there's so much stigma around being

335
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,649
you know oh you're in a psych ward and

336
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:14,309
this was the type where yeah you were

337
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:18,330
completely locked in and you're not even

338
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:21,090
allowed a spork there's no floss there's

339
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:25,918
no like you were given paper scrubs and

340
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:32,668
nothing else and you're with some pretty

341
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:34,890
interesting people and still I want you

342
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:36,840
to notice that through that did you see

343
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,110
how my speech had improved from the

344
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,610
first video to the second video that's

345
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,740
important like there was still

346
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,639
milestones along the way of improvement

347
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:51,210
even with dramatic setbacks and being

348
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:57,419
completely at the point of there is no

349
00:24:51,210 --> 00:25:00,360
way to continue okay so before the video

350
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:03,419
I'm breaking this into two time science

351
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:07,289
slots so we have birth to age 32 and

352
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:09,929
then we have the O day at age 32 to the

353
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:13,260
time of the video that was about almost

354
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:15,450
two years 21 months to two years I can

355
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,640
tell you absolutely that the trials the

356
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:22,390
difficulty the torture the pain the

357
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:24,730
problems of those 21 months

358
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:27,430
definitely surpassed all of the pain and

359
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:30,220
problems and trauma and I had not had an

360
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:34,470
easy life in any respect it surpassed

361
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:37,300
the effort the energy expenditure the

362
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,660
everything that had gone on the prior 32

363
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,659
years

364
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:48,790
so let's go back a little bit so from

365
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:52,360
the kind of hard to understand is but

366
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:56,110
from this video this picture sorry that

367
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:59,010
is my father and if you can see right

368
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:02,139
here that's me

369
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:07,360
so in he on construction companies and

370
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:10,000
he bolted I was first born so he bolted

371
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,149
child seats into the equipment with him

372
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,760
so from nine months old and on I went in

373
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,080
the field with him without running

374
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,330
equipment so when I say grew up in

375
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:24,370
construction yeah I had at age four and

376
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,050
five like I spent time in the office I

377
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,090
didn't go to preschool I didn't do

378
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:32,409
anything else I worked in construction

379
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:34,780
and ran equipment so throughout life

380
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,510
then I continued in the construction

381
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,490
Avenue I worked on eventually and more

382
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,620
environmentally neering and construction

383
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,090
management I didn't put any pictures up

384
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,500
here of construction sites because I

385
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:49,360
think you know what a construction site

386
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:54,270
look like so there were everything from

387
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:57,010
small multi-family home tracts to large

388
00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:00,540
hospitals and university buildings and

389
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:03,280
highly sensitive environmentally

390
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:09,399
environmentally protected areas that

391
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:14,020
required very particular care so part of

392
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,240
my job was actually sliding down ravines

393
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,150
and sliding down into the bottom of

394
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,920
canyons to take water samples and then

395
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,550
trying to figure out how to get back out

396
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:27,010
of it I had to do this during rain so

397
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:30,430
before during and after rain that was

398
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:33,970
part of my job I also did commercial

399
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:38,800
interior finishes so the picture on the

400
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:42,080
other side this is you can't really see

401
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,500
there's a woman's head right here

402
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,939
so this is 12 feet tall and 5 feet wide

403
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:53,600
it's one of two copper waterfalls that I

404
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:56,570
made for a project that I worked on so

405
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,550
and they mirror each other

406
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,899
there's dioramas there's paint there I

407
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:03,230
mean there's a lot of other things that

408
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:08,570
go on and the interior finishes of large

409
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:12,110
commercial hospitality offices and

410
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:14,780
assembly hall meeting places this one I

411
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,189
was very proud of this was a very huge I

412
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,770
mean I had a privilege of doing some

413
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:22,810
really fantastic and interesting things

414
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,810
prior to the injuries

415
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,000
you

416
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,639
Hey I was rather active I mean I did

417
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,950
quite a lot at this point right before

418
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,840
there lived on the beach I walked the

419
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,820
beach in the morning I ran this

420
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,889
contraption that I'm on if you're not

421
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,039
familiar with it it's called an

422
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:51,330
elliptical it's an outdoor elliptical

423
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:54,539
machine and it is brutal if you can ever

424
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,908
do for strength coordination balance and

425
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,970
I lived on Hills so when trying to go up

426
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:02,159
and down that that not only looked

427
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:06,419
ridiculous and took a lot of nerve and

428
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:09,450
guts in public with it but it was also

429
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:13,230
when I see this picture this remained

430
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:16,230
with me as later on as that if I could

431
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:19,830
get back to that I would know I had

432
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:23,370
recovered the picture on the other side

433
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:25,439
so when I was 24 I got full custody of

434
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:28,889
my youngest sister so I raised a

435
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,049
teenager from 13 to 21 while working for

436
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,000
myself going to school and doing

437
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:35,549
hundreds and hundreds of hours of

438
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,789
volunteer work I put this picture up

439
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:42,480
because I felt like it showed that

440
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:43,980
angsty teenager whenever you were

441
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,950
raising children or you're working with

442
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,480
teens you know that there's it's so much

443
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,789
more complex and so much more rewarding

444
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,789
than just oh yeah I raised a kid

445
00:29:53,419 --> 00:30:00,349
so I had done a lot of traveling like I

446
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:03,169
said a lot of volunteer work I worked

447
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:04,700
for many many years with the

448
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,679
organization for Jehovah's Witnesses

449
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,879
because many people don't know that they

450
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,070
do all of their own volunteer

451
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:13,488
construction work and have a very

452
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:16,399
massive disaster relief and construction

453
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:19,519
recovery program and often are on site

454
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,529
before even Red Cross is available so I

455
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,169
had worked with those and I had worked

456
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,849
with french-speaking refugees and

457
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:31,450
immigrants mainly from African countries

458
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:37,399
in Haiti that was my life before

459
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:39,499
September October 2012 the course of

460
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:45,738
events that took place then did cover a

461
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:48,320
span of a few weeks and the injuries the

462
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:50,869
reason I had the strokes was due to

463
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,178
being strangled

464
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:56,629
I was strangled and beaten I don't

465
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:58,579
remember very much of that they have

466
00:30:56,629 --> 00:31:00,439
certain flashes of things that have

467
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:03,379
returned I figure if I don't need to

468
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,779
know it I don't care if it ever comes

469
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:10,428
back but there's certain things that

470
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:11,719
stay with you um I remember and forgive

471
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:15,489
me because I really hope that you're

472
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:18,589
okay with a little bit of morbid humor

473
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:20,989
so the reason I would say that I know

474
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:22,789
for sure I was strangled about six weeks

475
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:25,039
after being in the hospital it started

476
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:28,429
coming back that I could remember and I

477
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,190
can feel strangling and since apparently

478
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:35,719
I had exhausted my ideas of what else to

479
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:38,509
do in order to stop this if anyone is

480
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:39,919
familiar with the show 30 rock there is

481
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:42,619
an episode where one of the main

482
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:48,320
characters Jack talks about into the

483
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:50,958
crevasse I see some dogs good what that

484
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:55,609
meant was that sometimes you have to go

485
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:57,229
down before you can go up so things

486
00:31:55,609 --> 00:32:00,349
strangled there was this moment where I

487
00:31:57,229 --> 00:32:04,039
guess what made most sense to me since I

488
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:05,839
couldn't get away was that I took my two

489
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,870
fingers and instead of trying to do

490
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,040
anything to them

491
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:14,179
I put them down my own throat so I put

492
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,920
my two fingers down my throat and I

493
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,840
pressed apart my vocal cords and my

494
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,990
lyrics so that I could continue

495
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,879
breathing because I figured if I started

496
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,960
vomiting or anything else what did it

497
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:31,500
matter and I figured the shock value had

498
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,050
to be worth something right so I

499
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,790
remembered that exact feeling of it's

500
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:38,850
not often that you've ever had to pry of

501
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:41,040
hurt your own vocal cords and the sweet

502
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,889
relief of actually being able to get air

503
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,830
through it I remember a few other things

504
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:49,800
of like my head hitting the pavement the

505
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:53,699
front end of a car few other flashes I

506
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,760
got away and then what started but

507
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:00,270
apparently I blocked that whole event

508
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:04,770
out I just knew I needed to get away so

509
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:07,430
I got back in my company car and I fled

510
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:10,440
I lived in San Diego at that time I

511
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:12,090
started driving I had previously lived

512
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,870
in Tucson Arizona

513
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,870
so I started driving to Arizona and

514
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,890
looking back now I'm incredibly sorry

515
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,480
for anybody else he was on the road when

516
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:28,410
I did that because obviously I was not

517
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,900
thinking well but because not only did I

518
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:33,930
try to get to Tucson but I went by way

519
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:40,080
of Vegas which adds about nine hours to

520
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:42,870
the try this went on to then I was

521
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,939
reported missing eventually I was found

522
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,439
on the side of the road in the desert by

523
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,170
the Sheriff's Department and all that

524
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,870
and transported to an emergency room

525
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:55,830
I was completely non-responsive at that

526
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:58,229
point but in the emergency room my body

527
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:01,429
started having spasms and I started

528
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:05,250
screaming and doing different things so

529
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:07,110
they eventually released me saying that

530
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:11,630
it was probably an intense case of the

531
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,630
flu so

532
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:18,770
friends from southeastern Arizona King

533
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,740
picked me up I went to their house so I

534
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:24,460
was at their house for a few days and

535
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:26,779
the strokes started happening

536
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,389
eventually we discovered that was

537
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,880
because of a torn artery in the back of

538
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:34,670
my head though artery walls had torn and

539
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,040
it caused a blood clot inside when that

540
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:42,230
blood caught started breaking apart

541
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:44,719
that's what led to the strokes so we're

542
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,429
going to choose one day of one of those

543
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,759
as our Oh day and we're gonna choose

544
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,919
that day is October 8 2012 because that

545
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,090
was the day that one of the emergency

546
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,680
rooms finally saw enough combination of

547
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,900
symptoms to understand that it was

548
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,240
neurological I was still barely

549
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:06,710
functioning or talking or doing well at

550
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,910
all but it wasn't until that day and

551
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,950
still they were saying that it was

552
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:13,810
meningitis or that it was something else

553
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:17,029
they finally took cat scans because I'm

554
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:19,460
MRIs because I was vomiting constantly

555
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,650
and a very interesting thing started

556
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:26,120
happening my eyes operated completely

557
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,920
separately so that I'm grateful that

558
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,930
that started happening because that was

559
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,960
the cue that allowed the emergency room

560
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:36,640
doctor to finally find that one of the

561
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,900
strokes so when he came in and he goes

562
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,490
you've had a significant stroke we're

563
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,690
transporting you immediately because I

564
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,319
was out in the middle of the country in

565
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:48,770
a very small County hospital so they

566
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,160
transported me I will say that from that

567
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:55,009
day I have memories of being put in

568
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,410
transport it was horrible it was

569
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,820
absolutely horrifying what was happening

570
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:04,609
inside but I also took it as that okay

571
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:07,310
this is what I'm doing now everything

572
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:11,270
else no longer mattered this was what

573
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:14,430
was going on so turns out I had massive

574
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:17,910
concussions in fact

575
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:21,089
headgear is a concussion prevention

576
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:23,308
device because the concussion actually

577
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:24,930
never stops so anytime I bumped my head

578
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:28,470
or anything like that it's a full-blown

579
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:31,700
concussion and usually has days or weeks

580
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:34,049
of massive repercussions kind of funny

581
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:38,118
repercussions but that shouldn't

582
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:41,400
happened so I had five or more strokes

583
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:44,190
they kind of quit at some point counting

584
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,750
or caring one of them was at least one

585
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,619
of them was a brain stem stroke I'm

586
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,839
going to bring this up because

587
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,599
cerebellar and brain stem strokes do not

588
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,670
present as normal strokes they happen at

589
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,890
about one to two percent of all stroke

590
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,380
cases they usually happen to younger

591
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,900
people they generally happen because of

592
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,210
maybe doing extreme yoga moves and

593
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,339
tearing an artery doing something that

594
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:09,869
impacts the arteries of the back of the

595
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:12,900
head so it's a very uncommon injury and

596
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:15,180
of the very Pew there's very very few

597
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,640
people who ever lived through a brain

598
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:23,700
stem stroke and fewer still that ever

599
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:25,230
get out of being locked in so I am very

600
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,180
grateful that I get to actually be here

601
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:30,900
and share this with you it's just it's

602
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,210
not common and that led to me having to

603
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,530
do a lot of my own recovery because they

604
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,040
had not had somebody lived through it

605
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,960
before and because of that a lot of

606
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,640
doctors professionals a lot refused to

607
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,549
work with me because they would not take

608
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,920
on the liability and as they told me

609
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:48,900
later they only expected death for me so

610
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,670
we're gonna take this zero day we have a

611
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,040
mostly torn artery we have the strokes

612
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,780
have concussion I already had congenital

613
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,119
hemiplegic migraine so let's just say

614
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:02,280
you have a massive migraine going on on

615
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,829
top of this I put suicidal here to put

616
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,869
bring up that the emotional impact of

617
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:09,839
what was going on the PTSD and the

618
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:11,940
suicidal part was already there from the

619
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,900
trauma of what had caused these injuries

620
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:18,000
I had no insurance and no money and I

621
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,099
was now completely pretty much locked in

622
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,059
that means I was completely alone so

623
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:26,940
that is our starting point and this is

624
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,430
for you to kind of give an idea

625
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,270
and imagine like all of your insides are

626
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:35,839
on the outside and they're all on fire

627
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:38,369
so you're on a non-stop tilt-a-whirl

628
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,650
your pain level and nausea or at ten

629
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:42,599
plus and every second you cannot tell if

630
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,039
you have limbs you can't make sense of

631
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,049
anything that's going on around you you

632
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:49,140
know it's life or death you're locked in

633
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:50,640
and you have a three-second memory this

634
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:56,190
was my starting point

635
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,529
that's my OD now breathe again I am NOT

636
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,049
bringing this up to be dramatic or to

637
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,970
make you scared but to go that was

638
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:04,859
simply what was going on and this was I

639
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,890
had to figure out a way to get through

640
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:09,960
it so breath is what it came down to it

641
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:12,390
was not guaranteed breath was not

642
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,289
guaranteed constantly but it was what I

643
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,288
had right then

644
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,649
so we're just gonna have what like three

645
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:23,599
main points through these 22 months

646
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,460
cavewoman there was a long period where

647
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,980
there was no internal voice there were

648
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:30,970
no words there was nothing inside

649
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:35,240
besides this giant cloud of

650
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:38,060
incomprehensible data and then whenever

651
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,390
words did return even inside it was

652
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:45,770
cavewoman talk how is it it might be

653
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:48,230
want water want water

654
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,420
internally I'm saying that 80 or 90

655
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,369
times over and over and over but I can't

656
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,840
communicate that to anybody so how am I

657
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:57,230
going to make advancement and get this

658
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,910
across now consider the impact that

659
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,710
you're suddenly have gone from being

660
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,598
very active having all these goals all

661
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:05,150
these plans you're completely dependent

662
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,760
you're completely bedridden they are

663
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,859
having to move you bathe you dress you

664
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,140
and even in that I couldn't be moved

665
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:14,569
because of the torrent artery a lot of

666
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,339
it I could not be physically moved or

667
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,590
touched at all in case the artery

668
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:21,109
continued to tear it was too close to

669
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,920
the brainstem to do surgery or to repair

670
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:26,540
it so that meant not only was I

671
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,310
incapable of moving but it meant that

672
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,440
for about nine months I had to stay

673
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,710
almost completely motionless while we

674
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,760
hoped that the artery healed but

675
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,410
thinking about being completely

676
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,770
dependent if you go from right now to

677
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:41,629
all of a sudden you have to be moved and

678
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,970
held by two or three different people

679
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:46,369
while they are cleaning you while they

680
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,109
are taking care of you while they do

681
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:53,210
anything and everything that they need

682
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:55,369
to that alone is like a shocking

683
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:59,000
horrible thing for somebody who'd always

684
00:40:55,369 --> 00:41:02,890
been completely independent and enjoyed

685
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,890
taking care of myself and others

686
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,540
so as I said I couldn't be moved I meant

687
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:10,580
no connection to my limbs they might I

688
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:15,880
was not completely paralyzed but I had

689
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,880
no control over my limbs so

690
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:23,700
let's do inventory time right now in

691
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:26,250
that this was what I had I could stick

692
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,808
to my guns to me the guns were

693
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:32,670
principles and tools that I had on hand

694
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:36,539
now if you can read the first one it

695
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:40,069
says think God's thoughts this is not

696
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:43,170
saying oh my I now have the mind of God

697
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:47,339
this was like an internal thing that I

698
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:50,910
developed over those years of I would

699
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:56,369
try to look at myself from the exterior

700
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:59,819
and think the highest cleanest best most

701
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:04,170
robust thought I could at any time and

702
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:07,890
look at it from the happiest point that

703
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,809
I could I also became very adept at all

704
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,640
of those months and years of laying in

705
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:14,309
dark silence alone with just my own

706
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,470
thoughts at then I would also look at it

707
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:20,099
from hey let's look at like what are

708
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:22,078
good things that God or somebody else or

709
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,299
somebody that is not going through this

710
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,789
right here could be looking down on so I

711
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:29,910
had developed and that worked to develop

712
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:32,730
words that were to create imagination

713
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:37,170
and to help me cope with being so locked

714
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:41,069
in and being alone this is a very huge

715
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:44,029
factor to me no one owes you a single

716
00:42:41,069 --> 00:42:47,788
thing to make your life more convenient

717
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:50,130
not your parents not your mates not your

718
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:54,059
children not your bosses not your

719
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:57,539
employees nobody owes you a thing to

720
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:59,039
make your life more convenient that does

721
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,470
not mean you are not worthy of

722
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,859
everything and yes you should absolutely

723
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:07,288
expect good things but if you look at it

724
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:10,380
from that no one owes you a single thing

725
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:13,289
that makes your life more convenient you

726
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,690
can become more responsible and a heck

727
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:17,789
of a lot more appreciative of every

728
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:22,589
single thing that anybody does that does

729
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:24,630
make your life more convenient so one of

730
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:27,779
the absolute biggest things for me was

731
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,220
humor as the strokes were going on and

732
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,800
they couldn't figure out why and there

733
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,439
was no

734
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,670
shopping I and at one point when I still

735
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,460
had internal thought I remember thinking

736
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,230
okay if this is gonna continue what is

737
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,060
the one thing I don't want to lose for

738
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,800
me it came down to humor because I

739
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,480
figured that I could lay there if I

740
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,640
could still hear people doing things

741
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,710
around me I could still have some kind

742
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,200
of idiotic running commentary I don't

743
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,210
find that would be entertaining for me

744
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,620
and if there were angels or somebody

745
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,510
else or something else that could listen

746
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:02,470
in then shoot maybe they could laugh too

747
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:07,690
so humor became like the core thing that

748
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:10,149
I was not willing to give up one of my

749
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:14,440
tools was I had years long spiritual

750
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:15,940
practice I do not have a clue how

751
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,630
anybody could have gotten through that

752
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:25,120
if I was not already accustomed to

753
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:27,550
meditation quietness and prayer those

754
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,380
were already a habit for me so I was

755
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:33,600
able to fall back on that that was a

756
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:37,510
huge tool I had breath some of the time

757
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,910
breath was not constant with the brain

758
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:43,270
stem damage that affects homeostasis so

759
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:44,740
my lungs did not always work my blood

760
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,660
pressure was different one side of my

761
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,509
body to the other my core temperature

762
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,220
dropped constantly if they repositioned

763
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,990
me like say maybe my lungs were working

764
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,060
pretty well while I was laying flat they

765
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,220
moved me to adjust a bedpan or do

766
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,020
something my heart rate would drop to 30

767
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:02,439
because I could not process the

768
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:04,720
stimulation of being moved and also keep

769
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,000
my heart functioning so there were many

770
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,279
I mean countless hours of it being that

771
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,350
internally I had to develop a pattern in

772
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,540
a way of gauging how much energy I had

773
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,190
to breathe so it came down to I have

774
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,680
this much energy I can go breathe

775
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,140
breathe breathe don't breathe

776
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,410
and trust that I had enough oxygen until

777
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:25,359
my body could take another breath but I

778
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,640
did have breath and I could control my

779
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,190
tongue I had my tongue pressure against

780
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,109
my teeth and I had so that was muscle

781
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:34,270
resistance I could control my tongue and

782
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:37,570
I had muscle resistance of my tongue

783
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:41,230
against my teeth now my purpose or an

784
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:42,850
end goal and to me it was key to have a

785
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,070
purpose not a plan

786
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:46,509
a purpose meaning that you know your

787
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:49,110
final destination you want to get to

788
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:54,010
doesn't matter how many times you change

789
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:55,690
so I wanted to well and here's the key

790
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:58,360
point to I think it wasn't that oh I

791
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:00,280
must live I think I didn't know that I

792
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,370
was supposed to or I was even allowed to

793
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,440
die I think this is what we're facing

794
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,690
now and let's get through it I had

795
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,430
always been very big on efficiency I

796
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,440
wanted to do it efficiently suit

797
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:15,460
efficiency and I wanted to get back to

798
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,350
that stupid ElliptiGO machine so I

799
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,000
needed to find a way out I needed to

800
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:22,390
figure out how to make connections and

801
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,430
how to prove that all of the fluff was

802
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,859
external meaning that all the softness

803
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:31,210
was external and I was still strong and

804
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,860
capable inside it was I had to know what

805
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,240
was going on inside though in order to

806
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,390
do that there was this cloud of

807
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,979
overwhelming data so the first thing

808
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,730
that I remembered this was one of my

809
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:44,500
guns was there was a prospector that my

810
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:47,260
dad had worked with when I was 10 years

811
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:50,110
old he would go out panning gold

812
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,520
I remembered the one of the very first

813
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,920
memories that came back to me

814
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,100
was working with him because he would do

815
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,140
dowsing he would create an electrical

816
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:02,500
circuit with the metal with his body and

817
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:05,680
then use a non conductive material and

818
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,660
he could test out exactly what materials

819
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,180
and in what percentages were in those

820
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,220
metals simply by the electrical circuit

821
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,490
that he created withholding the metals

822
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:18,339
and using a test ball I remembered that

823
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,259
and I figured okay my entire body is an

824
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,320
electrical system he said everything is

825
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:25,390
electricity so I knew that somehow and I

826
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,690
knew then that I could use my tongue to

827
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:29,660
create electricals this resistance

828
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:32,180
meaning that if something

829
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:35,000
was good right true or on that might

830
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:38,720
muscle would stayed strong if it was bad

831
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,839
no her off it would go weak so I had

832
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,480
basically an on/off or binary system

833
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:47,660
internal that was what I started with

834
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,640
this took a lot of trust so people would

835
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:51,558
come up and start talking to me I could

836
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,359
not comprehend what they were saying but

837
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,819
I trusted that somewhere in my body I

838
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,190
had known this somewhere before and I

839
00:47:55,819 --> 00:48:00,230
couldn't speak but they would talk to me

840
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:02,150
I would trust my body I would use my

841
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,680
tongue against my teeth if it stayed

842
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,200
strong I said yes

843
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,250
I didn't know what I was agreeing to I

844
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,960
didn't know if they were gonna bring

845
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,730
food I didn't know if I was going for

846
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,740
another test I had no idea what was

847
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,930
coming after that but my body had said

848
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,220
yes so I was going to trust it so if you

849
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:19,669
want to talk about getting good on your

850
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:22,788
gut instinct do it learn to trust

851
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,650
yourself before anybody and anything

852
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:29,150
else you can alleviate a lot of

853
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:30,799
heartache from your life so I started to

854
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:33,619
wrangle this cloud and I call this

855
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:35,869
analog binary style now all of these

856
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:38,029
impulses feelings things that were going

857
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,980
on internally I had to figure out a way

858
00:48:38,029 --> 00:48:43,460
and build a new platform in order to

859
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:45,020
comprehend them what I came up with was

860
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,829
I started breaking them into categories

861
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:52,190
and creating internally a branched

862
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:54,710
system of categorizing whatever was

863
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:56,900
coming in these were the primary ways

864
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,640
that I did that so again if I was

865
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,740
feeling something I would isolate that

866
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,509
and then I would test with my tongue if

867
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,729
it was mental emotional physical or

868
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:07,220
spiritual then I would start keep start

869
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:10,069
going through subcategories and as long

870
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,720
as my tongue stayed strong I started

871
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:13,700
associating a certain word with a

872
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,359
certain impulse a certain feeling or a

873
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:20,569
certain overall energy or electrical

874
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:25,940
signature that I felt that was how I

875
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:27,829
began to rebuild everything inside so if

876
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:30,109
you look at that and you go back to that

877
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:31,910
you're very perhaps analytical or you're

878
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:33,680
very introverted or you're very good at

879
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,359
systems engineering but that has nothing

880
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,930
to do with emotion or this and all that

881
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,930
in my experience it is all one in the

882
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,420
so the point was that even when I looked

883
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,089
calm I kind of look like I was just

884
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:53,150
laying there I was working I worked

885
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:58,150
constantly on this in fact in those two

886
00:49:53,150 --> 00:50:00,740
years I did about 350 thousand rounds of

887
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:02,990
starting to comprehend words and end

888
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,629
emotions and feelings and impulses and

889
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,509
sensations by testing them through these

890
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:10,690
branched structures until they started

891
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:13,690
to become slowly very slowly more

892
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,690
automatic

893
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:19,400
you could say I was obsessive on it

894
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,169
because the pain was so bad and I

895
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,849
figured what I could do was at least

896
00:50:23,169 --> 00:50:27,439
open up bandwidth I couldn't go in and

897
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,299
repair a brainstem or something else

898
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:30,949
directly but I could open up bandwidth

899
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:34,219
of all of this data that was just

900
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:38,439
overwhelming me and then my body could

901
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:38,439
go and fix whatever else was going on

902
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:44,470
I also had to start

903
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:47,110
Herman what wasn't mine there were

904
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:48,609
impulses feelings sensitivity things

905
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,260
that were going on and I had to

906
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:53,620
recognize that some of it wasn't mine

907
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,780
and I started doing that by looking for

908
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:58,810
a common electrical signature that I

909
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:00,670
could put whatever that impulse was with

910
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:02,590
someone pair it with someone that weave

911
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,150
around me pair it to somebody else and

912
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:06,010
if that was it I had to start creating

913
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,920
filters that way because I had none they

914
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:10,570
had been built over life I found those

915
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:15,070
common electrics electrical signatures

916
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:16,810
and then it would try my hardest to push

917
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,200
that stuff back on somebody else because

918
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:22,240
I had enough of my own stuff going on

919
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,919
and everything that you're doing every

920
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,680
challenge that you face and even when

921
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,390
you find a really good plan that you

922
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,850
want to enact in your life your career

923
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,670
your family anything you have to find

924
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:36,610
the motivation for me with relearning to

925
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:39,280
say to control a limb to control a hand

926
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:41,410
I needed to relearn to write so I did

927
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,460
that by writing my name then I figured

928
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:46,359
well I need to know how to write my name

929
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:50,040
and my address what I did was found

930
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:54,390
motivation to do this by hearing of the

931
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:58,270
hgtv dreamhome giveaway so I wrote out

932
00:51:54,390 --> 00:52:00,009
450 entries never did that and then I

933
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:02,740
coerce people into getting me stamps and

934
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:05,530
envelopes or whatever that meant I had

935
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,540
to ride out 450 envelopes as well but my

936
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,750
writing improved and one funny thing

937
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:12,400
about it was as writing returned I could

938
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:14,260
for a long time I could only write

939
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,000
mirror-image with my left hand where I

940
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,410
had always been right-handed before but

941
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,620
I could only write backwards with my

942
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:22,930
left hand it took time to flip over to

943
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:28,060
be able to write what you could

944
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:29,890
considered normal how I dealt with this

945
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,350
was relegating everything to that trust

946
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:35,410
system into that platform internal that

947
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:38,650
I had created I relegated numbers

948
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:40,180
decisions the trust that something was

949
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,820
good for me or not

950
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,440
all of that to my body system and to the

951
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,740
muscle resistance of my tongue against

952
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:51,070
my teeth for example this you can see

953
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:53,080
here I didn't logically choose what

954
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:55,600
color to put whereas I was re learning

955
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,910
to use a pen I would

956
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:01,270
also check for which pen to pick up and

957
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:02,920
then which cut thing to color so it was

958
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:06,340
done purely by removing any

959
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:11,170
decision-making or stress on me that way

960
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:14,230
I just did what my body said to do this

961
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:16,330
led to massive improvement long term and

962
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,940
formed the basis for all of the recovery

963
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:22,569
that you see so an example let's say on

964
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:24,400
one day I would check what my body could

965
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:26,560
handle and I would do just that

966
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,050
the overall goal might be to move my

967
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:31,450
left arm but I could check and say well

968
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:34,030
I can handle opening my eyes four times

969
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:36,040
every four hours I could set up for 20

970
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:38,170
minutes I can do this I can visualize it

971
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,480
this many times exactly and that is

972
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:43,330
precisely what I would do every day

973
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:48,010
constantly i recalibrated to what was

974
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:49,390
best for my system and I did that others

975
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:52,360
this eventually worked for working with

976
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:54,609
meds supplements everything I started to

977
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,960
be able to gain control and know and

978
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,490
that took a lot of courage to stand up

979
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,410
to the doctors and say know what you're

980
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:03,759
prescribing like I take your advice but

981
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:08,500
know I know what I need so I felt like

982
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:11,970
with doing that loops I felt like I kind

983
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:15,460
of coiled like a snake ready to spring I

984
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:17,259
was really calm and quiet but I retained

985
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,210
a lot of information and got ready and

986
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:24,550
then at times I would have massive jumps

987
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:28,060
forward in my ability as I said it mate

988
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:30,340
faced a lot of setbacks constantly this

989
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,720
has not been a linear path and you know

990
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,520
that you know your career is aren't you

991
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,370
know any goal you're going after nothing

992
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,780
has been linear so the setbacks are not

993
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,540
a problem it's just another learning

994
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:45,670
opportunity

995
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:47,230
one quick kind of funny story in the

996
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:49,660
first one of the first acute care

997
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:51,070
hospitals I was in because I had done a

998
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,210
lot of volunteer work I had worked with

999
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,210
organizations I

1000
00:54:54,349 --> 00:55:00,289
had a lot of people come to visit I was

1001
00:54:56,779 --> 00:55:04,030
not capable of receiving people but the

1002
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:06,100
nurses kept track of who came to visit

1003
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:08,680
I found out when I returned to that

1004
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,930
hospital to say thank you to them that

1005
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,000
the staff had been under the impression

1006
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:17,109
that I was some kind of real estate

1007
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,690
heiress I'm like what are you talking

1008
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:21,940
about I had when I left that hospital I

1009
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:23,530
had $40.00 that somebody gave me I had

1010
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,390
one pair of men's sweatpants

1011
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:28,090
I had a purse that had been run over and

1012
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:30,310
I had a broken bra that was what I had

1013
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:32,080
completely in the world whenever I left

1014
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:34,180
especially after the three years in

1015
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,650
hospitals and nursing homes but at some

1016
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,089
point they thought that I was an heiress

1017
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,530
which actually meant that I got better

1018
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:41,710
treatment in the hospital

1019
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:44,560
so I'd say nurture those volunteer and

1020
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:46,270
friendship and work those work

1021
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,590
relationships you do have because you

1022
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:48,220
never know when they might pay off for

1023
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:54,070
your health

1024
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:55,720
later on in very unexpected ways so one

1025
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,520
thing that I would say to you is that

1026
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:01,870
when you're facing a choice or challenge

1027
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:05,110
you rarely need more information you

1028
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:07,480
might need very few specifics but most

1029
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:10,180
likely you already possess everything

1030
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:13,000
you need to know in order to make the

1031
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:15,190
best outcome possible you might need

1032
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,110
more quiet you might need more breathing

1033
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:19,090
and you might need more self trust and

1034
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:21,370
as I have done it you can figure out

1035
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:23,740
your own way and you can increase every

1036
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,100
one of those I also figure out what's

1037
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,470
yours

1038
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,390
and what's not and get rid of the stuff

1039
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:32,020
that is not yours and I highly recommend

1040
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:36,520
humor I highly highly recommend using

1041
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:40,480
humor so if you stick to your guns and

1042
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,580
your purpose you can succeed no matter

1043
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,810
what you're facing and this might be in

1044
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,160
your day to day think let's say it

1045
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,810
worked there's some challenge that comes

1046
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,970
up a breach happens anything like that

1047
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:52,240
you can apply all of these principles in

1048
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:54,250
your own way to that exactly do what you

1049
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,609
can where you are with what you have

1050
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:59,590
until you have more then modify to your

1051
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:02,290
purpose you don't change your purpose

1052
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:06,430
you just now increase and enhance what

1053
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:09,279
you are going to do to get there so

1054
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:12,609
stepping back from the video that was

1055
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,590
what 2015 so - now I think from the

1056
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:16,269
video to you seeing me right here you

1057
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:19,449
can see there's massive improvement

1058
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:21,698
it's not stopped I still do all of those

1059
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:24,009
same basic things all day every day I

1060
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:26,379
don't operate the same as I did before I

1061
00:57:24,009 --> 00:57:29,769
don't operate the same as most anybody

1062
00:57:26,379 --> 00:57:33,909
I've ever met I have different abilities

1063
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:36,428
I have different limitations but I am

1064
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:38,949
genuinely finding happiness and joy and

1065
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:43,149
satisfaction and being precisely who and

1066
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:45,909
what I am now here I don't have I can't

1067
00:57:43,149 --> 00:57:47,618
get on an elliptical yet some point

1068
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:50,619
we'll try to get back there again I

1069
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:51,969
still spend about 85% of my time alone

1070
00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:55,899
and most of that is still in dark

1071
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:57,789
silence but I do stick to my guns the

1072
00:57:55,899 --> 00:58:01,379
tools that I use then and to my purpose

1073
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:04,839
and I continue to expand no matter what

1074
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:07,029
so between the video and now eventually

1075
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:08,199
I was able to be in a wheelchair the

1076
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:09,429
first year and a half two years I

1077
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:11,079
couldn't be because my body could not

1078
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:13,059
systemic ly handle being moved through

1079
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:15,009
space eventually I was in a wheelchair

1080
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:17,529
then eventually as you can see Trevor

1081
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:19,899
there with me doing aqua therapy that

1082
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:21,939
was who helped me reel into walk with

1083
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:24,159
hundreds of hours in the pool relearning

1084
00:58:21,939 --> 00:58:26,199
how to handle it and he would pull me to

1085
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,029
the stairs as I paralyzed or fatigued

1086
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:29,499
and he would help me get out onto the

1087
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:31,149
ground and lay there and then he would

1088
00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:33,669
help me once I was capable getting back

1089
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:38,109
in the wheelchair so those of you who

1090
00:58:33,669 --> 00:58:46,089
came to see him I understand that but

1091
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:47,769
there's no refunds he couldn't so one of

1092
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:50,109
the other thing is I get to be here with

1093
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:52,149
you all now I get to speak and talk and

1094
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:54,339
move and breathe and handle things and

1095
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:56,499
enjoy life now that I didn't and in

1096
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:59,319
those years there was no hope put out

1097
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:04,029
for me to ever be able to thank you all

1098
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:16,210
may your guns always serve you well

1099
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:18,829
[Applause]

1100
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:21,470
and this will be in a slide deck this is

1101
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:23,690
a list of therapies and AIDS that I used

1102
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:26,180
and if you have any questions you can

1103
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:29,950
definitely reach out to me on Twitter or

1104
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,950

1105
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:35,150
[Applause]
