1
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,400
all right good afternoon my name is Jeff

2
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,690
- hope Nick and we're gonna be

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,570
presenting network security monitoring

4
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:38,730
so a little bit about me I love network

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,739
ideas IPS administration and engineering

6
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,419
I can't really tell you why I just like

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,459
the challenge here's my credentials you

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,829
can note that I graduated from VCU twice

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,860
I worked here so this is a little bit of

10
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,739
a home for me and I probably know over

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,379
50% of you so that's pretty awesome

12
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,949
I love ethical hacking of a Python

13
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,869
junkie like everyone else right here

14
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,960
automation and virtualization where I

15
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:09,900
work at now kind of fell in love with it

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,649
also Family Guy like movies Beach

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,310
contact sports home-improvement and a

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,950
little bit of water working in

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,409
restoration I'll be putting this

20
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,860
presentation at the github link so if

21
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:27,170
you want to just capture that you can

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,170
check out the presentation slides later

23
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,649
all right

24
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:39,960
all right the legal slide the views

25
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,880
expressed or not are my own and not an

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,960
employer or any organization I'm

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,139
affiliated with blah blah blah

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,548
alright so experiences lessons we're

29
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,170
gonna go over a quick introduction for

30
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,369
network security monitoring most

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,270
everyone here probably knows what that

32
00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:00,270
is or heard of something about it I'm

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,949
gonna give my background and NSM some of

34
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,819
the challenges and solutions that I've

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,770
faced solved or have yet to solve

36
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:10,860
including architectures as well as going

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:15,780
into actually some tuning lessons and

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,940
then we'll just wrap it up all right so

39
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,700
this quote I love because it

40
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,599
encapsulates my experience but also

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,310
DevOps because failing was a really bad

42
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,790
word and then someone came up with

43
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,850
DevOps

44
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:34,109
and now failing is great so network

45
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,400
security monitoring there's the

46
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,640
definition off of Richard Bea's book

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,080
most everyone who's in NSM and some

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,018
former mother has heard of it this book

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,870
that he's written so that's kind of like

50
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,200
the the source if you will just de facto

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,300
because it's been around for a while

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,670
it's easy to focus on network IDs like I

53
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,680
do or a single tool but at the end of

54
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,470
the day you need to build your ecosystem

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,500
to be effective you can't rely on one

56
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,450
thing you know security is kind of like

57
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,840
ochres and onions you know they have

58
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:17,459
layers to them and every organization is

59
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,709
going to be unique so Dane Holden get

60
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,540
give a pretty good talk I'll give a

61
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,790
reference in a little bit here but I

62
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,400
talked to him and I was talking to them

63
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,489
about my presentation and my content and

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,500
he just boiled it down to two words so

65
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,180
if you take anything away from here just

66
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,730
remember you got to get scope and

67
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,010
coverage right that's that's probably

68
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,640
the most critical thing otherwise the

69
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,440
rest is pretty much details so network

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,089
intrusion detection systems for those

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,190
that may not know it's a system that

72
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,500
monitors and inspects the network

73
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,470
traffic it's looking for signatures

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,060
these signatures can be behavioral or

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,790
they could be a pattern match that when

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,650
it creates the alerts you know matches

77
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,989
the traffic and creates an alert it'll

78
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:09,000
then send it to a logging system sim may

79
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:12,239
alert via email so send out email a

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,859
whole bunch of different methods your

81
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,108
sock has to be able to respond to the

82
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:16,769
alerts in a timely fashion in order to

83
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,738
be effective

84
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,169
otherwise you're pretty much performing

85
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:25,138
recovery and you also have to maintain

86
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:30,450
and update your signature database also

87
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:32,370
a PCI requirement there's Network

88
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,380
intrusion prevention system now this

89
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,360
system sits in line with network traffic

90
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,740
and obviously it's called prevention

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,130
system because it's meant to prevent

92
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,530
attacks the key here is to get a correct

93
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,669
configuration because you don't want to

94
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,229
end up dropping traffic that is isn't

95
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,539
malicious it's actually actually

96
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,979
legitimate and

97
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,310
also still need your incident response

98
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,410
so common misnomer used to be you buy a

99
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,480
network IPS system and hey we're good

100
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,310
we've prevent all our text right well I

101
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,200
really everyone here knows that's not

102
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,670
the case that you may stop one attack

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,750
but there's ten others coming your way

104
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:12,570
so you know IPS is great to stop that

105
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,640
initial attack kind of stop the script

106
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,200
heady stuff but a determinant attacker

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,590
is still going to get through so you

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,969
still need your incident response to

109
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,590
ensure that you're still protected and

110
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,590
to catch anything that does get through

111
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,290
so again IDs you have a look

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,700
low risk of network disruption if your

113
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,530
tap fails or something like that you

114
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,340
might have something at risk but

115
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:40,919
generally network engineers prefer that

116
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,760
method you have lower resource

117
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:48,690
requirements on your actual IDs device

118
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,580
versus an IPS device but you do have

119
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,010
higher resource requirements on your

120
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,349
network gear if you're doing a spam port

121
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,390
now again another case for tap we'll

122
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,970
look at that in a little bit you have

123
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,570
easier implementation maintenance is

124
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,630
easier as well and for false positives

125
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,310
it's really not so critical so if you're

126
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,560
really low on resources or really just

127
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,730
need to get going right away just do IDs

128
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,950
and don't worry about the false

129
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,020
positives because your analysts will

130
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,550
hate you but your network guys just be

131
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,340
like it's great we don't have to worry

132
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,670
about blocking legitimate traffic again

133
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,950
IPS network configuration has to be

134
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,400
right it is resource intensive on the

135
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,900
device itself and you do need higher

136
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,539
manias because you do have to spend the

137
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,060
time and effort to do the tyrrhene you

138
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,750
do have risk to network connectivity if

139
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,600
you feel that configure correctly and so

140
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,420
again network guy is a really adamant

141
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,850
you know the networks got stay up all

142
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,180
right so diagram I tried to include some

143
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,570
pictures so you guys can look them up

144
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,900
later this picture this diagram in

145
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:01,230
particular is actually pretty not

146
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,929
correct on the top side does someone see

147
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,169
maybe an improvement they can make right

148
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:12,189
off the bat

149
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:17,830
oh okay I'll give you a hint it's it's

150
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:20,080
got the word span on it okay so so where

151
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,330
the spam port is is on the router I

152
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,039
would actually probably move that to

153
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,620
below the firewall and I'll discuss why

154
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,520
in a little while on the right that

155
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,680
diagram is of a span on a switch port

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,378
span stands for a switch port analyzer

157
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,279
and as you can see in the diagram it's

158
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,139
pretty basic

159
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:44,259
just copies traffic and sends it out in

160
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:46,870
your face so tap or span which one did I

161
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:49,330
go with well you really have to look at

162
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,020
some factors like how much cost can you

163
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,758
afford not only monetarily but also your

164
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,620
engineering resources do you have

165
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,830
network engineers that can you know

166
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,240
throw their time and efforts at this

167
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,219
what kind of design do you want do you a

168
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,219
simple passive fiber tap where you

169
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:08,289
basically take a fiber plug it in and go

170
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:12,250
or do you want something cut kind of

171
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:13,810
more managed tap wise where you slice

172
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,979
and dice the traffic that you're sending

173
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:21,159
to your IDs and other appliances as well

174
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:22,810
you can do things like filter and even

175
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,719
the newer taps they can do all kinds of

176
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:30,849
things like like SSL inspection and deep

177
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:33,070
packet inspection like that you can also

178
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:36,370
do multiple taps into one feed so it's

179
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,709
easy to think of a one tap but think of

180
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,570
a tap fabric if you will so if your

181
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:43,929
organization has network connectivity

182
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,050
spread out across the globe there's ways

183
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:49,050
to bring it all back to a central point

184
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,300
now span ports

185
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,060
you don't need additional money invested

186
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,420
as far as buying additional network here

187
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,670
as most network gear today passband

188
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,229
capabilities but again you got to check

189
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,599
out what your network device

190
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,430
capabilities are and we'll discuss kind

191
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,800
of the relationship between network

192
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,560
engineers and security engineers but to

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,910
me it's critical and it works well with

194
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,550
me because I have a lot of respect for

195
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,500
network engineers I think they do some

196
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,000
pretty amazing things they work with

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,250
some amazing technologies

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,650
hats off to network engineers and they

199
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,730
make my job easier in most cases but uh

200
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,209
but some of the newer switch mono let's

201
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,750
do some pretty cool stuff are spans er

202
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,840
spans we'll talk about those the problem

203
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,420
on the monitoring side is you might lose

204
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,640
a span port and not know it because a

205
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,699
lot of times network team is in charge

206
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,699
of the network gear and security team is

207
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,400
in charge of security gear and it's just

208
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,900
a feed and if it dries up and you don't

209
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,090
have an alert you'll just you won't get

210
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,340
in traffic and you won't know about it

211
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:01,120
and come to find out a network engineer

212
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:04,390
change your configuration so you got to

213
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,670
check on that and also I mentioned the

214
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:11,740
resource utilization is on the switches

215
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,569
everyone's favorite so trying to be

216
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,220
vendor agnostic so this is the only

217
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,220
slide I will prevent different or

218
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,100
present vendors this is not a complete

219
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,640
list but we'll go over the open source

220
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,880
options Zeke which it was most people

221
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,000
who knows bro I like Troy's talk I gave

222
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,980
an RV a sec 5 you give a really nice

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,310
presentation so definitely check that

224
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,860
out

225
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,170
if you're looking at an open source tool

226
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,230
you have snortin sericata and security

227
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,360
onion which is an actually distribution

228
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,390
that wraps up the three previous tools

229
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,390
and even some more tools up nicely so

230
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,810
it's easily deployed vendors there's a

231
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,010
list there it's a very incomplete list

232
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,229
but there's kind of a starting point

233
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,450
just get checked out and if you're

234
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,820
interested check out the Dan Holden

235
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,089
speech with Elizabeth Martin they gave

236
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,820
RV SEC three they do mention the five

237
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,520
year cycle and so it's been about five

238
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,440
years so a lot of things that you talked

239
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,140
about have cycled through and over but

240
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,630
they've also kind of hit the nail on the

241
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:21,330
head with probably the last 10 to 15

242
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:27,310
minutes I'd say of their presentation so

243
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:29,850
some open source considerations are it

244
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,709
is less expensive it's open source right

245
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,170
it's also flexible because it is

246
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:38,710
source everyone knows the advantages of

247
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:41,079
open source the things to consider you

248
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,610
do need to purchase or I highly

249
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,280
recommend purchasing high-performance

250
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,490
NICs I've had really good luck with mera

251
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:51,310
kaam I think they got bought out by CSPI

252
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,870
there's also n days Solar Flare and I've

253
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,579
also used Napa Tech in the past with

254
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,770
good success the cool thing that I also

255
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,960
have seen or done is just take a

256
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,720
decommissioned server or servers and

257
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,640
throw them into a cluster you know I

258
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,010
kind of like rebuilding things or

259
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,870
getting my hands on technology so I

260
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,520
always see organizations that geek on

261
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,340
something and it goes to the scrap pile

262
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,680
or whatever nothing wrong with taking

263
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,440
that and using it and getting some more

264
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,780
use out of out of that and the cluster

265
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,590
it's nice too because if it dies it's

266
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:28,780
clustered there's a lot of support for

267
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:32,340
the open source community security onion

268
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:34,720
has a very active feed and mailing list

269
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,090
there's actually people dedicated to

270
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,900
responding to inquiries in that

271
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:43,350
community and there's also professional

272
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,120
services available for open source tools

273
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,930
security and solutions is actually borne

274
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,930
out of the security onion distribution

275
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,819
Doug Burks runs it he's a great guy

276
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,069
there's also of ours here's a couple

277
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,750
listed here but you know everyone's

278
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:03,220
probably already got a var so two can

279
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:05,830
work with your var to get started and

280
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,800
open source it's kind of a trade-off

281
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:12,790
between monetary and your time and

282
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,010
energy and effort to expend so if you

283
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,750
have a team of four folks you might be

284
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,880
good at open source but if you've got a

285
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,650
you know get somebody to do it and just

286
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,830
get it done you might want to pay the

287
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:29,590
additional cost for a vendor also we

288
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,410
talked about investments there are

289
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,660
additional options I think on up on the

290
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,339
vendor appliances you seem to have some

291
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,339
additional bells and whistles that

292
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,230
aren't standard for Network IDs but are

293
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,550
pretty nice to have in the security

294
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:47,530
realm and they have service and support

295
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,800
and you always get a sales rep an

296
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,709
engineer so everyone likes to eat right

297
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:59,500
so there's a bonus there with your sales

298
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:01,750
rep and they do focus on IPS because you

299
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,930
know it's really clz and catch you to

300
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,900
say you know our products in IPS we stop

301
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,810
traffic but just be aware that your

302
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,850
vendor may support IDs as well so if

303
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,949
you're not ready to throw it in line and

304
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,290
just start blocking traffic you can go

305
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:22,210
ahead and put in IDs mode and then flip

306
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:24,430
the switch later beyond ids/ips again

307
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,190
I've talked about the ecosystem you have

308
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,469
your host based ids/ips log forward

309
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,020
forwarding log correlation storage

310
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,450
analysis which is generally required by

311
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,410
your governance risk and compliance your

312
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:41,770
forensics your incident response

313
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:44,350
packy captures talk about that nice one

314
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:48,010
you have Moloch packets LED and nisith

315
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,990
ng you have forensics they get the

316
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,319
support and sim integration which is

317
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,860
pretty crucial or network security

318
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,380
monitoring all right so now the more

319
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,320
better stuff in my opinion so my

320
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:05,860
background actually before this will

321
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,570
start in 2004 I was a professional

322
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:14,320
firefighter 2014 or my master's degree

323
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:18,190
came out to work here at VCU and started

324
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,740
working on security onion and you know

325
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,330
kind of fell in love with it going on to

326
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:30,670
leave the network ids/ips architecture

327
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:34,030
and started with a CSP in 2015 and 2017

328
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,520
took over the whole ids/ips we have

329
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:40,870
about 30-something devices deployed

330
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,210
around the globe and 2019 actually need

331
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,860
to update the first slide because

332
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,110
recently my boss left so they made me

333
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,610
interim manager so I haven't been in the

334
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,100
training yet so I have had the probes to

335
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,890
remove all the technical knowledge so

336
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,220
we're still good on this talk

337
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,510
I think I'm not supposed to say that

338
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,510
that's probably the manager training

339
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,590
some challenges that faced as uh as IDs

340
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,170
an administrator some network engineers

341
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,120
are confrontational they they really

342
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,770
pride themselves on keeping the

343
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,250
availability of the network right so

344
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,510
part of that CIA triad it really their

345
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,180
network said I'd be available because if

346
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,520
the network goes down they they don't

347
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,380
hear the end of it some budget

348
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,699
constraints I think all organizations

349
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,700
face these in one form or another

350
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:36,260
scalability as a cloud service provider

351
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,949
you have to be able to grow fast and

352
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,470
administration you know just the usual

353
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,870
everyone faces backups central

354
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,470
management logging reporting all the fun

355
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,700
stuff so some of the solutions i've

356
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,710
designed and implemented i'll go in

357
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,020
these in detail but the first one was

358
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:56,430
pretty cool is a really large security

359
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,560
onion server I'm a technologist and this

360
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,689
thing was awesome I mean talking about a

361
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,909
terabyte of RAM you know five years ago

362
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:08,280
it's just had a great GUI by the way but

363
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,550
that was at the scaled solution were

364
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,849
which worked out even better the vendor

365
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:17,099
solution that had to scale and then also

366
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:19,770
I'll go into the elbe architecture but I

367
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,689
was able to apply that after learning

368
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,589
about it and actually meeting the guys

369
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,960
that developed it which is pretty cool

370
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:32,250
all right so architectures anyone

371
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:36,450
recognize this structure yeah New York

372
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:43,170
City the shipyard I think yeah so that

373
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:46,590
that's a pretty cool staircase so this

374
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,950
is kind of the basic architecture of

375
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,740
network ideas at least how I think of it

376
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:56,340
internet router firewall Network ids/ips

377
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,830
and switch and then devices so I

378
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,600
actually had another student and asked

379
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,409
me one time whoa well why do you put it

380
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,199
behind the firewall

381
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,900
why not the router or you know run out

382
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,010
to switch content you want to answer why

383
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,870
why it's not it's not here right below

384
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,870
the router but before the firewall

385
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,510
exactly so you want your devices you

386
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,210
want the router to take the first hit

387
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:28,230
because it's layer 3 and it's making

388
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:31,320
simple IP comparisons so you definitely

389
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,970
don't want it above your router and

390
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,189
below your router you know you might be

391
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,900
monitoring a threat that's actually

392
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,840
dropped by your firewall so and you're

393
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,050
also using additional resources to do

394
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,030
that or as your ids/ips device you

395
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,649
actually want to use less resources so

396
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,960
you're actually monitoring true traffic

397
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,120
and if you go below the switch then you

398
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,800
went into well now you're monitoring one

399
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,270
segment but you may not be monitoring

400
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:00,419
another you know vice versa so this is

401
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,040
how I think of it initially you know

402
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,410
because you get attacked from the

403
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:10,170
internet but we're missing something

404
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:12,780
anyone note we're missing it you are

405
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:17,480
missing east/west but even bigger than

406
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:19,920
that ok I'm missing my malware callbacks

407
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,120
but the great thing about it is I don't

408
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,550
have to change my architecture to

409
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,678
monitor that so when you're looking at

410
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,809
your logs and you see source and

411
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,300
destination IP and it looks reversed

412
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:33,450
just just remember you're monitoring or

413
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,889
both so if you see an attack and the

414
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,900
source and destination IP are switched

415
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,780
you know starting in malware callbacks

416
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,490
or even you might have an attacker on

417
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,940
your network attacking another network

418
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:49,440
so bi-directional ingress and egress or

419
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:53,250
the network folks alright the one big

420
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,880
server so it was very easy to administer

421
00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:00,630
his one big server there's easy to

422
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:05,370
backup easy to set up the architecture

423
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:07,679
was there it is it's one server the

424
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:11,669
budget request was two line items it was

425
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:16,410
the server and the storage and the data

426
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:19,790
certain footprint was very small and if

427
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,350
you wanted to you could virtualize it

428
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,570
the problem with virtualization is you

429
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,189
take about a 20% of performance that and

430
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,470
that's just kind of metrics that we

431
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,620
gained after doing a little bit of

432
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,930
research at my workplace but obviously

433
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:38,030
that number of fluctuate but expect

434
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:41,030
about 20% hit for virtualization some of

435
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:44,030
the disadvantages it's inefficient on

436
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,770
this resource utilization you have to

437
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,260
really know what you're doing on a

438
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,690
system I'm not a great system

439
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,510
administrator I can get around but when

440
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,790
you get into things like CPU pinning

441
00:20:52,510 --> 00:21:00,440
that's a that's above me I can read it

442
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:03,500
but I can't really apply it also your

443
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,510
interfaces they can get set saturated if

444
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,110
it's on one server if you're clustered

445
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:11,300
you kind of have that balanced scheme so

446
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,370
you don't get saturated but if

447
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,590
everything's going to one spot and you

448
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,060
peak your traffic you may end up

449
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,659
dropping packets or and losing

450
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:24,620
visibility and also you're a single

451
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,990
point of failure if you're in IDs mode

452
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,530
maybe you don't care so much if you're

453
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:35,150
an IPS mode you're gonna get a call from

454
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:37,250
network guys and and you can't really

455
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,600
repurpose older hardware because you

456
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,330
generally don't have a one terabyte

457
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,929
server or one terabyte of RAM and a

458
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:48,169
server lying around if you do great by

459
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:51,470
all means go for it but it's it's just

460
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:54,590
nothing not something I would see so my

461
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,180
lessons that I learned as I said you

462
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,909
need that seasoned system administrator

463
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,880
tune it you can do multiple network

464
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:05,810
interface cards and set up flows and

465
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,020
hashing that way and I mentioned

466
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:11,840
monitoring outbound traffic but you also

467
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:19,460
want to monitor for other things like

468
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:21,080
data loss files etc all right so next

469
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,960
challenge was security onion with er

470
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,899
spans I did not set this up initially I

471
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,060
kind of came into it again somebody

472
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,850
resigned and I kind of took over for

473
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,320
them so it was great because it's very

474
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,899
flexible

475
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,409
agile all stuff people like

476
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,750
virtualization you can have a backup IDs

477
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,270
so you don't lose monitoring if if your

478
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,700
primary goes down for for maintenance or

479
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:51,230
has an issue and you have a backup ready

480
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:53,930
to ROCK disadvantages um I had no idea

481
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,210
what your span was I just it was above

482
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,560
me so I had to check it out I didn't

483
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,630
really have any Network folks to help me

484
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,110
out so I finally figured out what it was

485
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,550
and it's pretty cool but again keep that

486
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,689
relationship with the network engineers

487
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:10,790
tight as you'll need your their help and

488
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,340
you also have to be on supported

489
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,920
hardware not all Network peer support TR

490
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,560
spans it is becoming very prevalent but

491
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,080
a couple years ago it wasn't quite so

492
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,340
much and and you're also relying on spam

493
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,629
ports I think we talked a little bit

494
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,600
about that I'll talk about that a little

495
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:33,110
bit more all right so some of the

496
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,459
lessons it's pretty lucrative because

497
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,320
you can sniff anywhere in the network

498
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,680
and have a single monitoring point

499
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,720
pretty nice your network appliances

500
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,470
though they do take the hit from the

501
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,150
spam port and your configuration

502
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,220
management and version control of your

503
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,250
network gear can really help out with

504
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,100
trying to ensure that spam port stays

505
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,480
operational and the simplest thing I try

506
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,969
to break things down so I can remember

507
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,070
them if you're doing l2 connectivity you

508
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,940
can do an hour span if you're doing all

509
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,419
three connectivity do an ER span and the

510
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:11,290
e stands for encapsulated so

511
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:15,740
encapsulated remote switch port analyzer

512
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:17,240
took me all night to remember that all

513
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,160
right now one of my favorites because

514
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,030
actually met the folks that developed it

515
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,740
is the Lawrence Berkeley labs design

516
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:28,220
they published a paper if the link is

517
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,250
here it's a great paper it's super super

518
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,800
technical so if you want to each out

519
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,030
check it out it's really useful gives

520
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,220
you a lot of great advice whether you

521
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,590
use their architecture or not on doing

522
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,500
network IDs but essentially they're

523
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,980
doing optical taps to an aggregation

524
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,820
switch aggregation switch to their

525
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,880
cluster

526
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,149
it's a broke luster it skills they're

527
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:58,430
doing 100g monitoring they've got two

528
00:24:53,150 --> 00:25:02,620
switches 75044 Arista and then a 71 54

529
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:06,800
phone Arista it's very easy to scale

530
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:08,870
easy to manage traffic and you can

531
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:13,340
actually modify it pretty easily fit

532
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:16,100
your organization's needs where I was we

533
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,379
we actually used sericata instead of

534
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,730
broke because it kind of met our

535
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:27,650
requirements a little bit better at the

536
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:30,080
time alright so the problem that we hit

537
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,210
or at least I did was uh we were getting

538
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,790
a lot of encrypted traffic and so we

539
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:38,630
weren't really seeing what we wanted to

540
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:41,110
see we're seeing a whole lot NTP traffic

541
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:45,140
but also we were monitoring VPN traffic

542
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:52,310
we have you know after it was encrypted

543
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:55,070
so it wasn't quite as beneficial but it

544
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:58,460
did meet a compliance requirements so we

545
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,460
kept it around our network teams they

546
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,350
loved the optical taps they're pretty

547
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,460
much mean it's free there's no moving

548
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,780
parts and lonely downtime is the

549
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,790
implementation otherwise you're dead

550
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,360
it's an optical tap you know you're just

551
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:16,700
you're splitting light I think the easy

552
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,620
way to remembered or if you got to

553
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,870
explain optical taps and how it works to

554
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,899
management the easiest way to is to say

555
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:26,060
I have a flashlight and there's a tree

556
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,610
outside so I shine the light through the

557
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,790
window at the tree so the light still

558
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,439
you know it's the tree but I can see it

559
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,680
in the window so you're kind of you're

560
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,310
splitting light there's a gigamon paper

561
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,710
I reference to that uh actually explains

562
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:44,750
things like light loss and how to make

563
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,090
sure that you you don't hit any issues

564
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:51,580
but for the most part it's plugging in

565
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:54,350
and wherever the network guys do they do

566
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,270
your wrist of switches I fell in love

567
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,629
with these again I'm not a network guy

568
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,209
so

569
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:02,379
I found them very easy to use I know

570
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:03,820
there's other switches out there that

571
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:05,799
people like but I personally just like

572
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,468
these because of the full Bosch

573
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:12,699
implementation every interface is

574
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:16,690
available on a in a Bosch CLI tap

575
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:18,129
aggregations pretty nice you can slice

576
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,889
and dice your traffic however you need

577
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:25,529
to and for management there's a pretty

578
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:25,529
GUI available that looks like that so

579
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:31,479
alright so now we get into our

580
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:34,029
proprietary appliance or vendor

581
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:38,409
appliance so I inherited this

582
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:40,509
architecture transitioning from a span

583
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:43,779
set up they're actually gone in mind

584
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:47,229
because the device was more efficient at

585
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:52,719
doing in line monitoring versus span

586
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:55,929
sniffing I my first impression was kind

587
00:27:52,719 --> 00:28:01,329
of blah I wasn't too impressed when I

588
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:03,639
first started but well I found that the

589
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:04,989
bells and whistles I was like I don't I

590
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:09,968
don't need this stuff I just want to do

591
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:10,989
IDs an IPS various devices I inherited

592
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:12,249
were in different states

593
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:15,129
some of them working in some weren't

594
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:18,429
somewhere named differently it's kind of

595
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:20,589
bad but switching costs that I think

596
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:23,169
we're all in the boat if you have an SM

597
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:26,079
the switching cost just private you from

598
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:27,639
switching and when I heard the term

599
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:32,379
unified threat management I thought it

600
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:34,869
was just a sales term I but since then I

601
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:38,198
do like the fact that the inline

602
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:40,839
configurations do allow IPs you can do

603
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:44,109
IPS on certain network segments to start

604
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,999
out with they use VLAN configurations

605
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:48,489
again I'm now not a network engineer but

606
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:51,909
this was pretty cool I thought this was

607
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:55,359
kind of magic when I saw it but network

608
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,829
engineers are just like blah or you

609
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,658
could do true inline where you plug one

610
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:00,698
wire in one interface and plug another

611
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:04,089
in the other and it goes to the device

612
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:05,559
itself so lots of options

613
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:07,899
I started looking at unified threat

614
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:11,469
management management a lot better and a

615
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,580
lot more and I decided that I may not

616
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:15,100
use the

617
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:19,270
blocking capabilities but the logging

618
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:22,179
features were pretty pretty impressive I

619
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,810
could get all kinds of logs based on my

620
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,760
appliance so I turned it into unified

621
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:31,919
threat logging versus unified threat

622
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,270
prevention so things like like

623
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,920
application level blocking I just wanted

624
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,790
to put in monitor mode because I don't

625
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,030
want to deal with the fallout of

626
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:45,060
blocking something somebody used like

627
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:48,010
maybe Facebook so it's like bro but

628
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,720
different and it's different because the

629
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:54,370
logging is different but otherwise you

630
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,500
get very similar information so I

631
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,320
learned to leverage my position with the

632
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:04,720
vendors to get trainings certification

633
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:08,230
and food you I do suggest that you still

634
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,180
do a bake-off not only before or right

635
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,250
before or when you're ready to buy an

636
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,840
appliance for the first time but

637
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,330
continue I assess where you're at you

638
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,820
know if you have another vendor that

639
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:21,669
offers you a bake off you know check it

640
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:24,490
out get some ideas and just affirm that

641
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,360
either you have the right appliance or

642
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,680
maybe you would want to look at

643
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,500
switching but it's always good to know

644
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,570
what's out there

645
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,710
interior devices are right-sized also

646
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:37,689
applies to open source solutions as well

647
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:43,090
you know looking at bandwidth device

648
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:45,370
processing and your interfaces so it's a

649
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:50,139
little bit harder to find open source

650
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:52,570
just FP interfaces but it's a little bit

651
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:56,430
easier if you buy a vendor appliance

652
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,429
they just support them out of the box

653
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:04,110
your dashboard reporting all the fun

654
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:08,110
stuff central management and backups

655
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:11,139
don't forget that as well so now we're

656
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,929
into the next generation this is the fun

657
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:17,350
part of working for CSP software-defined

658
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:22,720
data center so is anyone in here running

659
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:25,199
an STD see like a VMware NSX environment

660
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,200
type saying

661
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:34,640
okay I'll spend some more time on this

662
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:37,040
then because I really like it so your

663
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,420
distributive firewall and everything is

664
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,520
virtualized and the software-defined

665
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,270
data center so even your network your

666
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,220
switches

667
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,350
it's your edge services gateways

668
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,810
firewall everything specialized which is

669
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,090
nice because you have what's called a

670
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,760
distributed firewall where you apply the

671
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:55,040
rules centrally and you can put them

672
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,290
everywhere so it makes configuration

673
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,700
management in version control pretty

674
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:03,350
easy also your network devices you can

675
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,320
repeatedly deploy them in different

676
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,270
configurations you're not physically

677
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,689
racking and stacking them aside from the

678
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:13,460
first run to get them in place that's

679
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:18,410
your topper rack switches but that's a

680
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:22,010
little bit different your API is the key

681
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,180
here so everyone in security from what

682
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,150
I've seen he likes Python

683
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:29,270
except for so for those who like Perl

684
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:31,160
you're still feeling it all but um but

685
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,090
both work really well with the api's and

686
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,680
so the software-defined data center just

687
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:39,409
it just mixes with API is real well so

688
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,020
you can do your own automation roll your

689
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,630
own it's very easy to do your

690
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,900
integrations with third-party happen via

691
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:50,510
something that they call in EDX so it's

692
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,750
very seamless it works with their api's

693
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,850
and their software and your network IDs

694
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,200
and IPS functionality is actually

695
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,360
achieved through something called

696
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,500
service chaining so think of your

697
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,449
virtual machine the service chaining

698
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,970
actually looks at your VM done to the

699
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:13,760
NIC level and applies traffic rules

700
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:15,170
right before it hits the neck and you do

701
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,570
have an alternative option if you don't

702
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,810
want to do IDs and IPS and service

703
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:23,179
chaining you can actually do a tap

704
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:25,310
virtual tap that does service chaining

705
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,350
as well but just doesn't tap mode so you

706
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:29,870
would at that point dump your traffic to

707
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,959
wherever your VM resides it could reside

708
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:37,449
anywhere in that data center

709
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:40,779
so pretty similar to a physical tap and

710
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,490
don't forget ER spans that I had to

711
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:46,749
figure out what they are they are

712
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:48,190
supported in NSX so another option again

713
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:50,440
checking with your network engineers to

714
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,809
make sure their switches don't die if

715
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:58,230
you enable it so some advantages talk

716
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:01,389
about flexible you can define your

717
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:04,379
network IDs deployment down to the

718
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:07,840
v-neck level you can define it by switch

719
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:09,909
the the advice that I've gotten mostly

720
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,500
from some of the seasoned veterans is to

721
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:17,919
use security tags so use security tags

722
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,710
if you can it's automatic a che already

723
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,029
integrated it's very scalable and it

724
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,918
solves the east-to-west traffic

725
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,750
monitoring issue that was mentioned

726
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,549
because it works on the v-neck so

727
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:32,409
knowledge does it go north-south it goes

728
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:35,290
east-west disadvantages no fully open

729
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:38,649
source solution yet I think that's only

730
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:41,319
a matter of time maybe a next

731
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:43,710
presentation or something but we'll see

732
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:46,599
it does require specialized knowledge so

733
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:52,149
you do have that next level expert that

734
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:53,349
needs to be involved and you can't

735
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:55,659
utilize the service training

736
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:59,770
functionality on the switch interfaces

737
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:01,900
so it's nice to monitor the the VMS but

738
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,299
if you say I want to monitor all traffic

739
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,309
on this switch it's on the VM level it's

740
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:10,540
not actually at the switch because the

741
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:12,520
switch runs in the hypervisor again you

742
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,540
can use ER span probably to mitigate

743
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:19,059
that so what's the feature of network

744
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,759
IDs look like so some things i've

745
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:24,940
thought of using a micro service to run

746
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,349
ids/ips your service chaining someone's

747
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,089
probably already done that just haven't

748
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:30,130
heard about it I think that would be

749
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:33,540
pretty easy to do

750
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,730
anyone here Robin running kubernetes

751
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:40,960
that's where I would do this the micro

752
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:43,869
service you might see forcing the IOT in

753
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,340
SCADA community to go through a separate

754
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:49,000
monitor point

755
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:54,040
pretty much specifically for IOT and

756
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,050
SCADA and something I'm looking forward

757
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,990
to I think it's already here I just we

758
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:03,730
haven't gone deep enough into it yet is

759
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:05,500
AI field smart alerting so I'm not sure

760
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,380
how I feel about AI but I really feel it

761
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,410
could help out and the alerts I think

762
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:18,610
it's I think the flood of alerts can be

763
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:20,319
lessened with AI and further integration

764
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,600
so I don't think we're fully integrated

765
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,300
with our security products I think

766
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,660
there's a lot more work to do to get

767
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:31,800
that nice single pane of glass

768
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:34,029
everything together in one shot easily I

769
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,960
think we're getting pretty close to it

770
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,220
but I don't think we're quite there yet

771
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:48,510
all right let's go go into some

772
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:50,770
operations and some rule tuning I mean

773
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,120
all right so first we want to start out

774
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,890
with disabling categories of alerts

775
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,569
because if I have a Windows environment

776
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,940
maybe I don't care about Linux and vice

777
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,220
versa so just disable full cat

778
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,690
categories and then you start looking at

779
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,700
your false-positive hits and you can

780
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:10,390
start disabling those based on either IP

781
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:12,279
signature or both ids/ips idea is

782
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,529
obviously the team tap spam port

783
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,990
scenario you want to start with a lot of

784
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:19,300
rules and then trim them down if you're

785
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:21,370
doing IPS start with only a handful of

786
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,440
select rules and then add to them and

787
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:26,200
the reason is if you add a rule you want

788
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,970
to start small because if a rule does

789
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,160
end up blocking legitimate traffic you

790
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,480
want to be able to catch it versus you

791
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,040
know if you had a whole bunch then you

792
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,530
may not know which rule is blocking what

793
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,330
traffic and you can do a testing

794
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,690
bake-off the way you could do it is

795
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,430
clone a production system and ensure

796
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,340
that IDs and IPS is configured to

797
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,129
monitor that and requests red team pen

798
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:54,010
testers to hit those boxes and see what

799
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,900
kind of alerts you get and if you don't

800
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,440
get an alerts you can form a packet

801
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,930
capture figure out what

802
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,930
what's the deal usually it's encrypted

803
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,560
speaking of pcaps you'll need scalable

804
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,779
storage if you want to store them it's

805
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,910
kind of a decision you're gonna have to

806
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,170
make if I did just logs or if I do logs

807
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,350
and pcaps there's advantages

808
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,120
disadvantages to both some things to

809
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,430
consider if you do a disk array it's

810
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,779
nice for short-term storage but for

811
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,509
long-term storage consider something

812
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,110
like s3 storage bucket something like

813
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,000
that

814
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,700
I like the hybrid approach because I

815
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,350
have access to recent logs but I also

816
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,689
return retain my logs for long-term

817
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:38,380
storage you know he was called a hot

818
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:43,000
warm and cold storage as well all right

819
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:48,800
TLS inspection pretty much gotta decide

820
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,810
do I do I maintain privacy or do I want

821
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,700
to inspect all traffic and I've kind of

822
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,190
thought about that says do I have BYOD

823
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,259
or do I have only company owned assets

824
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,870
if you have a mix try to segment them

825
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,890
with network segments so you can monitor

826
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:05,870
them independently for for only things

827
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,250
like servers or corporate owned assets I

828
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:13,220
would consider highly SSL TLS inspection

829
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:17,150
for BYOD type stuff be the legal privacy

830
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,230
issues I would probably not and that's

831
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:25,270
something everyone's got to make

832
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:25,270
themselves and so from experience yeah

833
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:33,589
so another meme this is probably my

834
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:37,930
favorite this is a experience this is

835
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,930
not a lesson this is from experience

836
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:48,640
though event hooks and automation

837
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:53,230
deployment scripts or scripted scripts

838
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,460
simple bash scripts you can do a lot

839
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:59,510
what kind of infrastructure do you have

840
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:02,830
salt instable chef puppet your sddc

841
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:05,860
a lot of vendors are embracing

842
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:09,290
infrastructure deployment systems

843
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:11,509
deployment be a bash is probably through

844
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,710
an API and on the backend of

845
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:16,019
on the backend of infrastructure

846
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:19,430
deployment systems is also the API it's

847
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:22,649
just wrapped in up tune different rules

848
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:24,029
backups in version control we've already

849
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:27,359
talked about that but you can do things

850
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:29,819
like a scripted API calls you could do

851
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,400
scripted backups either a pole or a push

852
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:34,170
and you can also integrate with your

853
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,430
enterprise solution if you have an

854
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:40,170
enterprise backup operations

855
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:45,839
something that I'll be all guys did

856
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:47,880
pretty well is for their ssh flows they

857
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,710
really don't care about the data payload

858
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,799
they just care about the control traffic

859
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:59,420
so as soon as there's an ssh connection

860
00:40:52,799 --> 00:41:01,859
made the I think is bro yeah Justin

861
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,829
Justin created a script that it would

862
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:08,670
just capture the control packets and it

863
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:11,999
would actually drop the data the data

864
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,890
data but the data packets so you're not

865
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:17,038
capturing trick encrypted traffic you're

866
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:21,259
just capturing session information Towe

867
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,259
integration is also pretty critical

868
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:28,019
logging integration this is kind of a

869
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:31,669
basic log setup I think everyone here's

870
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,669
gonna be somewhat familiar with this

871
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:39,930
question you might ask is why an inter

872
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,848
mayer intermediary syslog server we've

873
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,859
had a few incidents we're going through

874
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:45,960
the sim was kind of painstaking we knew

875
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:49,170
there was information and here the pcap

876
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,539
or the ids log so we just went to the

877
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:56,299
syslog server we're gonna a couple of

878
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:59,849
commands you know grab cut whatever and

879
00:41:56,299 --> 00:42:02,819
and found what we needed to another fun

880
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:06,509
command is z grep so if you don't want

881
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:12,170
to have to unzip your file you can just

882
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:15,599
use equipped and for another alternative

883
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:19,170
consider apache Kafka it's open source

884
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,269
log forwarding tool queues up logs in

885
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,450
case your log server dies stuff like

886
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:23,450
that

887
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:31,650
so a couple of tools just to kind of

888
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,989
help her through snort logs there's

889
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,929
actually another tool that was presented

890
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:39,779
earlier today called cyber chef and it's

891
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,219
included in security onion and so check

892
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:43,259
out Jonathan glasses talk that he gave

893
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:47,160
earlier on cyber chef as you can

894
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:50,039
leverage that as well and I think

895
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,529
someone in this talk mentioned they were

896
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:56,489
concerned about running their queries

897
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:57,329
against the hosted cyber chef site so if

898
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:57,929
you're concerned with that you've

899
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:59,759
already got it

900
00:42:57,929 --> 00:43:01,169
security onion you're good to go you can

901
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:03,479
just run against the one on security

902
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:07,650
onion what I like to do is I like to

903
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:10,098
have my analyst install security onion

904
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:13,019
on their workstation and use it as a

905
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:18,269
analyst tool as well not just ids/ips

906
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:21,868
system all right what do I log network

907
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:23,399
IDs and IPS alerts obviously files I

908
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:26,219
want to see all files coming in and out

909
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:33,659
of my network IP traffic I want to see

910
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:35,909
on the wire I want to see DNS you can

911
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:38,309
check out Jeff Cummings presentation

912
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:44,939
yesterday on why you want to see DNS and

913
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:46,859
DHCP traffic all right

914
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:48,868
so network security monitoring is anyone

915
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:53,939
here in the cloud anyone moves through

916
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:57,059
the cloud okay yeah so it's it's picking

917
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:58,859
up the speed at which organizations are

918
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:00,659
isn't moving fully to the cloud or doing

919
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:03,839
a hybrid approach or multi cloud is a

920
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:07,349
new thing is picking up pretty quick

921
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,679
something is to consider our UI as as or

922
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:11,969
SAS customer so basically no matter what

923
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,299
you have two options you can bring your

924
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:17,459
traffic logs and alerts all back or you

925
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:19,589
can just do an SM in the cloud and maybe

926
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:21,209
you want to just selectively take

927
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:25,319
interesting things back to your own

928
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:27,178
network so here's kind of a another

929
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:29,939
diagram that I'm not going to go over

930
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:32,880
because I want to get through this but

931
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:34,450
please check it out and you guys get

932
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,550
some time

933
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:39,189
all right so infrastructure-as-a-service

934
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,360
is kind of like a DIY

935
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:44,300
platform-as-a-service is kind of in the

936
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,130
in that middle gray area and when you do

937
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,770
is software-as-a-service you really

938
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:50,780
don't have much visibility you might get

939
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:54,009
app logs but you're not gonna get things

940
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:56,990
like OS logs and software-as-a-service

941
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,450
over theirs now the cloud managed

942
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,129
security service providers that can help

943
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:07,149
out with things like visibility and

944
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:07,150
doing NSM in the cloud yep

945
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:13,520
so in summary a vendor solution versus

946
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:17,270
open source solution not just about

947
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,910
money how do you gain visibility taps

948
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,700
versus bands can the VLAN routing

949
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:26,350
virtual wires your appliance gateway

950
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:28,970
which is applicable to the cloud

951
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:31,310
software defined data center feature

952
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:34,759
architecture run over some rule tuning

953
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:38,990
test QA logging pcaps event hooks you

954
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:44,730
guys and again scope and coverage or CEO

955
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:48,988
Dan Holden thank you everyone

956
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,989
[Applause]
