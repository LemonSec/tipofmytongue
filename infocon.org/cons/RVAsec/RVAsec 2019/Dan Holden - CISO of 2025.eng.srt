1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,700
this is my fourth time at RV a sec I

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,069
love this conference it's phenomenal I'm

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,540
a big fan of the multiple tracks and so

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,269
here I am once again and I really

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,620
appreciate it I'm Desmond Holden on

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,100
Twitter so you can heckle me there as

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,150
well so getting started

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:25,439
every good presentation as you know

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,990
starts with a Sun Tzu quote I'm messing

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,750
with you guys

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,610
ad be a jerk move I do want to use some

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,649
quotes though I normally don't but I

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,700
read a book a while ago and this was

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,140
actually brought up yesterday when

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,550
yesterday's talks how many of you have

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,379
read the Phoenix project fantastic I'm a

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,550
big fan of this is you anybody that's

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,800
read it or even heard of it probably

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,599
knows it's about the DevOps revolution

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,169
and there's actually a lot of discussion

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,750
on LinkedIn Twitter etc about dev sec

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,670
ops and a lot of the things covered in

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,100
this book I think are very relevant to

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,710
sec ops and I think a similar revolution

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,660
needs to happen there and so I'll cover

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,150
some of that but we'll start with a

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,820
quote that was specifically about the

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,380
sea so in the book Jimi's problem with

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,658
the auditors shows that he can't

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,509
distinguish what work matters to the

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,820
business versus what doesn't and I think

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,689
as we all know and we've heard it from a

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,970
lot of the talks this week about the

34
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,529
business security relationship matter of

35
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,390
fact Andy kicked off things yesterday

36
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,450
with that very topic and we've heard a

37
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,430
lot about that obviously we make made

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,380
huge headway in terms of the industry

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,909
and how we relate with the business but

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,729
that's still one of the primary

41
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:45,119
challenges continuing with Andy's

42
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:47,549
keynote yesterday a lot of times I I

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,500
mentioned CISOs being in the fall guy

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,119
scenario and I really like mentioning

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
the fall guy mainly because I'm a gen

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,750
Xer that loved that show in the early

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,390
eighties but since everyone knows Game

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,270
of Thrones will call the the CISOs the

49
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,619
game of dethrones here there's a lot of

50
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,929
different challenges and a lot of things

51
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,479
I'm going to say or not you know one

52
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,409
size certainly does not fit all

53
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,239
obviously every business is different

54
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,830
every structure is different every see

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,790
so it's different etc so I think you all

56
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,180
are aware

57
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,190
so I'm not casting any any wide

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,379
dispersions but I am basically

59
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,209
highlighting what I have both personally

60
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,399
seen and what we have seen as a company

61
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,860
at Pharaoh's with the hundreds of CISOs

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,590
that we have talked to sold to worked

63
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,209
with over the years etc a lot of

64
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,709
different scenarios here part of this

65
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,599
comes down to reporting structure and

66
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,330
you'll see the analysts cover reporting

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,379
structure a lot and over the years

68
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,260
they've been talking about how it's

69
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:43,409
improving drastically majority of CSO is

70
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,420
used to report in to the CIO now things

71
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,370
are changing especially in a post breech

72
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,809
scenario that's really where I think you

73
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,260
see most of the reporting structure

74
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,739
changes occur I will say most of the C

75
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,078
says I see still reporting of the CIO

76
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,609
which can work anything can work if the

77
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,970
business wants it to work and supports

78
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:06,480
it however I will say personal

79
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,540
experience is highlighted that seaso

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,060
reporting under the CIO is often set up

81
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,040
as a fall guy and part of the reason for

82
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,389
that is that the CSO ends up getting

83
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,450
caught up in trying to protect the you

84
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:24,000
know ocean of IT assets and IT projects

85
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,760
rather than what matters to the business

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,380
and so when I say the business I mean at

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,130
the executive level and at the board

88
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,720
level right so take for instance warren

89
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,700
buffett since we all know that name and

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,280
he's I'm sure on multiple boards you

91
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,369
know does the CIO and Warren Buffett

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,380
agree on what is important to be

93
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,120
protected and I think that's something

94
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,389
that's incredibly important for a CSO to

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,220
be asking otherwise you know who are you

96
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,099
who are you trying to please you know

97
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,680
your boss or the board member and so

98
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,230
that's a that's a possible conflict the

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,269
other issue is just being able to defend

100
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,840
the security program itself whether that

101
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:06,090
spend whether that is the risk analysis

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,549
occurs whether that is the security and

103
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,579
protection that the program is capable

104
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,280
of many CISOs when they are questioned

105
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,630
can't defend what they're doing and so

106
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,950
that sets them often as the the fall guy

107
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,269
other issue of course is just being

108
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,080
challenged by other aspects of the

109
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,670
business whether that's audit compliance

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,169
legal

111
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:32,990
etc so there's a lot of pitfalls Charles

112
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,630
tango see so at tree earlier was talking

113
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,460
about his talk next week or next year he

114
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,530
was going to propose was why not to be a

115
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,560
see so and I thought that was brilliant

116
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,989
I hear that from quite a few see so so

117
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,880
it certainly is an issue so we wanted to

118
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,370
look at this I think we've all heard for

119
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,650
many years that CISOs typically have you

120
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,660
know an 18 the 24 month turnover period

121
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,390
and so we actually went on LinkedIn and

122
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,010
pulled some numbers about executive

123
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,409
positions that have been in the role for

124
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,270
less than nine or 12 months and you can

125
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,980
see CISOs at the top here compared to

126
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:09,890
CMOS CFOs and CEOs and this made me

127
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,690
think actually of RSA this year I'm sure

128
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:15,080
many of us were there but there was a

129
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:18,560
big conversation / complaint if you will

130
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,330
coming out of the event Wow you know the

131
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,280
security industry itself seems to be

132
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,810
doing quite well the conference gets

133
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,270
bigger every year there's tons of money

134
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,630
being spent and made but are we actually

135
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,789
making security better or as an industry

136
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,350
are we just becoming more profitable and

137
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,960
better at raising you know money and

138
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,490
building companies etc etc and so I

139
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,320
think a lot of the CSO's were asking

140
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,800
themselves yeah you know is the industry

141
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,950
actually helping us improve our programs

142
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,160
and so obviously it seems that we're

143
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,740
used to the C so turning over why why

144
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,750
why do we all say that and then ask

145
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,510
ourselves you know why is that why is

146
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,830
that occurring and it's to the point I'm

147
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,590
sure many of you especially in sales

148
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,849
know the company Discoverer I'm not

149
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,130
picking on them they're just doing their

150
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,900
job but as you can see in this example

151
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,480
they're so familiar with this problem

152
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,419
that they actually arm salespeople in

153
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,530
companies with how to sell when that

154
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:17,330
seesaw position turns over obviously if

155
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,010
you have turnover that's a potential

156
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,560
sales opportunity both for the new CEO

157
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,830
the old CEO of the folks that replace

158
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,530
the seat you know etc etc and so it's to

159
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:30,530
the point where not only do we all know

160
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,239
this but the industry is selling into it

161
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,359
right they're taking advantage of it and

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,760
so you know obviously that's just good

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,500
capitalism but at the same time as an

164
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,120
industry I think we should be asking our

165
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,400
why the hell is this position turning

166
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,890
over so frequently and what can we do

167
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,080
about it and that's both of course on

168
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,950
the CSO's and austin on us I think is an

169
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,930
industry the CSO is not the only fall

170
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,180
guy though I think we're all familiar

171
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,620
obviously with Equifax we already end up

172
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,920
repeating the same breaches over and

173
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,050
over again but we've got well over half

174
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,090
a dozen CEOs that have now become the

175
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,950
fall guy in breach scenarios matter of

176
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,409
fact today it was announced that Equifax

177
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,240
is the first breach that has actually

178
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,290
caused the credit rating of the company

179
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:20,300
to go down well which is funny since

180
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:24,110
Equifax is a credit related company but

181
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,580
it's also interesting when the when the

182
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,190
CEO was testifying in front of Congress

183
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,289
he was asked what was the most important

184
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,390
thing to Equifax you know from a

185
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:36,290
business crown jewel standpoint let's

186
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,030
say was it our data that they had or is

187
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,500
it the fact that they sold a service

188
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,190
that when all of our data was leaked

189
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,870
they would protect us and so that's a

190
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,240
really good question to ask yourself you

191
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,300
know one as someone that you know as we

192
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,040
all had to deal with that breach but

193
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,410
what are you protecting what were they

194
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,970
protecting were they protecting our data

195
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,770
as a crown jewel were they protecting

196
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,800
their business their product their

197
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,419
solution is a crown jewel I won't make

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,220
assumptions but it's a very interesting

199
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,870
question all right so why are the CSO's

200
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,150
in this position in other words what

201
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,500
have we as an industry armed them with

202
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,799
what are they leveraging what are they

203
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,380
using famous book if you never heard of

204
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,910
it eating soup with a knife that's kind

205
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,680
of what it this feels like and let's

206
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,950
start out with and this is the part

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,630
where I poopoo the industry so start

208
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,030
with GRC because I really like picking

209
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:32,000
on this this is actually not for me this

210
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,289
from Gartner it might be the first time

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,679
in my career that I'm quoting Gartner

212
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:38,330
actually John Wheeler one of the

213
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,789
analytic Gartner recently posted a blog

214
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,219
I think it was just maybe a month six

215
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,490
weeks ago on four reasons why GRC is a

216
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,500
useless term not relevant for senior

217
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,010
leadership certainly a guy like Warren

218
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,210
Buffett gives two craps about your GRC

219
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,580
negative connotation in many

220
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,250
risk management practitioners and I

221
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,899
think the most important one because

222
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,210
many things in this industry have made

223
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,820
big promises and end up kind of being

224
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,040
pigeon-holed into one thing and I think

225
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:12,440
you know the the G and the R aren't

226
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:15,020
nearly as influential or evident as the

227
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,080
C here so compliance ended up being a

228
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,470
big aspect of GRC and as a market term

229
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,240
it is increasingly meaningless now which

230
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,589
is funny when an analyst says that

231
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,930
they're the ones that are helping it

232
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,339
become meaningless but I can tell you

233
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,630
I've talked to a lot of analysts and

234
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:33,080
there's blood agreement in this space

235
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:37,130
matter of fact a former Gartner analyst

236
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,450
old buddy Richard Steinem was recently

237
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,770
doing a talk where he said GRC is

238
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,550
nothing more than documenting that

239
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,209
you've done your job

240
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,130
and whether we're talking about GRC or

241
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,160
we're talking about frameworks we're

242
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,339
talking about breach avoidance products

243
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,620
or any of the multitude of aspects that

244
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,209
is what a lot of this ends up being the

245
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,970
CSO is of course trying to save their

246
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,079
bacon and doesn't want to be the fall

247
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,589
guy and so they're doing the best they

248
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,720
can

249
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,760
and so this puts them in a position of

250
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,410
leveraging of course what is out there

251
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,270
and a lot of that just has to do with

252
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,920
due diligence how many times have you

253
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,930
heard I can tell you how many times have

254
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,849
been asked you know what are our

255
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,040
competitors doing what is you know what

256
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,410
is the level of due diligence of the

257
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,150
rest of the industry and let's match

258
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,250
that because then at least that's

259
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,470
defendable you know to the CEO and board

260
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,480
the problem is it's not it's

261
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,870
increasingly not defendable and that's

262
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,470
what I want to touch on Charles tango

263
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,660
again

264
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:36,079
downstairs today in the 101 session did

265
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,240
talk about how risk is not security and

266
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,279
so I want to add on to that and say not

267
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,730
only is risk not security but security

268
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:47,390
is not protection so in this example we

269
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:51,050
have our hero obviously he looks like

270
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:53,630
he's in some risk or at risk and perhaps

271
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,420
he does have some security maybe he's

272
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,180
got a big knife on him maybe even has a

273
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,939
single shotgun maybe he's got a you know

274
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,310
a a sword and can swashbuckle for a

275
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,779
moment but he's obviously outnumbered in

276
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,998
other words the

277
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:10,100
hacker sophistication that he is up

278
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:13,459
against is beyond his capability to

279
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,490
defend so he's at risk he has a level of

280
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:18,649
security but the ability for him to

281
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,889
protect himself is beyond the security's

282
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:24,170
reach and so we use these terms all the

283
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,800
time but they are not interchangeable

284
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:31,040
they do not mean the same thing and

285
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,809
again picking on the industry here berry

286
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,389
this morning I mentioned this you know

287
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:39,559
the thing that you can of course control

288
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:42,920
is what you have at what you have at

289
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,629
risk right the the assets the the

290
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,628
important things to the business you can

291
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:50,660
control you know how how exposed they

292
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,939
are but you cannot predict whether

293
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,589
you're going to be attacked and I find

294
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:56,089
it hilarious that there are literally

295
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,850
products and solutions out there that

296
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:03,050
try and do that same thing Monte Carlo

297
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,180
simulations AI you know whatever fluff

298
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,680
you want to throw at them but that is

299
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,059
not necessarily the name of the game and

300
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,529
again CISOs are trying to cover

301
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,779
themselves and say oh well you know

302
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:14,470
we're we're going to prevent a breach

303
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:16,759
well again you've got to ask yourself

304
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,250
does Warren Buffett care about a breach

305
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,860
or does he care about a breach that

306
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,910
impacts the business and again two

307
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,370
different things and this brings up you

308
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,300
know classic debate you know chaos

309
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:36,170
theory black swan you know you can you

310
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,099
can measure risk all day long you can

311
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,500
make predictions

312
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,879
you can have your scorecard you can do

313
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,129
all that stuff it makes you feel better

314
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,730
great if you can defend yourself with it

315
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:49,059
great but you can't predict whether

316
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,410
something is going to occur or not

317
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:54,230
whether there's a history a lack of

318
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,059
history we do know that things just

319
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,699
happen

320
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:01,969
matter of fact it happened big with of

321
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:04,490
course apt one and since this term

322
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,379
hasn't been abused too much lately in in

323
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,499
front of me I'll use it and talk about

324
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:13,550
apt but this was a fantastic blog a

325
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:15,949
company called counter Sept and the blog

326
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,620
is is about of course the targets of apt

327
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:19,930
one and what happened

328
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,130
but the real meat the whole takeaway for

329
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,769
the blog is really the last two

330
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:26,170
paragraphs and it was all about these

331
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,899
companies not understanding what would

332
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,849
happen if their crown jewels if the

333
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,670
things that matter to the business were

334
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,620
stolen and again this goes into the risk

335
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:38,469
equations right what we ask ourselves is

336
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,060
well what is an asset worth in these

337
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,290
scenarios not only did these companies

338
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,899
need to be asking themselves what an

339
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,209
asset was worth but a new variable was

340
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,370
introduced in the fact that not only is

341
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,349
it worth what is it worth to our company

342
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,339
in our business our customers but what

343
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,990
is it worth - in this case China and so

344
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,300
obviously the impact was huge and the

345
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,450
tenure of a single CEO you know these

346
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,930
companies essentially went under in in

347
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,519
two cases declared bankruptcy and in the

348
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,989
case of ATI you know trading at less

349
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:13,060
than half of what it was pre attack so

350
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,550
again you can't you can't necessarily

351
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:19,029
predict these things you really have to

352
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,760
start protecting yourself from the

353
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:26,260
ground up you you don't start at these

354
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,610
guys levels and work your way down what

355
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,589
you do need to understand though and

356
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,630
what your board members and your CEO

357
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:35,440
need to understand is what the impact

358
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,029
will be right if if anything does occur

359
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,320
what is the impact this was discussed

360
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:43,720
heavily today by both Barry and Charles

361
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,949
it's not about you know everybody says

362
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,029
well the breach is gonna occur the

363
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,469
breach is going to occur well if we keep

364
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,600
saying that then yeah why are we working

365
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,250
so hard and breach avoidance understand

366
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,170
what the impact will be and work

367
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,880
backwards from the impact another old

368
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,060
mantra and security I want to touch on

369
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,010
is does ROI exist if you google security

370
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,209
ro I guarantee you there's three blogs

371
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:09,399
that pop up there a decade or more old

372
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:11,920
they basically argue that you know

373
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,699
business ROI does not exist in security

374
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,469
sure but there is a very clear

375
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:19,839
definition I think we can and should be

376
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,880
using in this industry for ROI and CISOs

377
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,740
specifically need to be talking about it

378
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,709
in this manner so that they can both

379
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,480
defend their budget and when additional

380
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,420
budget headcount whatever is needed for

381
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,340
the the program to be more successful

382
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,310
of course in the CISOs view things look

383
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:41,890
like this you know everything's DEFCON

384
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:45,310
and cool the problem is many times this

385
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:48,069
is just that defense in depth but

386
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,109
expense in depth you've bought a bunch

387
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,590
of stuff you've got a bunch of logs

388
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,790
you've got a bunch of things happening

389
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,050
whether you can manage her at all or not

390
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,469
of course as a question you could

391
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,270
outsource it you know but the issue is

392
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,040
are the things that you've invested in

393
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,560
actually providing you what you were

394
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,230
expecting and that's a question that's

395
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,729
very rarely asked matter of fact it did

396
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,240
come up recently if any of you are

397
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,280
familiar with the vendor seaso podcast

398
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,780
it was a question that came up and funny

399
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:21,040
enough it was a vendor asking and I

400
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:23,140
believe and the CEO said no we don't

401
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,810
look at it after the fact and probably

402
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,730
most CISOs don't but you have to think

403
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,920
about it this way every single time you

404
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,860
buy a solution every time you buy a

405
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,560
technology every time you invest in a

406
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,590
new control set you just went into a

407
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,689
negative ROI because we all know that of

408
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,910
course people are the magic of security

409
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,530
the people process and technology or

410
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,180
what bring out all together but as an

411
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,130
industry we always talk about and focus

412
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,920
on the technology the people and the

413
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,840
process are we going to be are going to

414
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,260
be leveraging that technology and

415
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,580
actually creating the ROI right so if

416
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,460
you buy stuff and throw it in the closet

417
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:03,250
that's negative ROI if you buy stuff and

418
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,530
you don't tune it correctly let's say

419
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,030
you have amazing response capability but

420
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,369
you don't have detection capability

421
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,589
these are all negative ROI situations

422
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:14,319
and so those need to be addressed and

423
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:17,290
looked at why because from the CFO

424
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,939
standpoint they just you know or the CEO

425
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,920
right there's more and more money

426
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:24,220
funneled into security and yet the

427
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,550
business can't in most cases say what

428
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:30,370
they've gotten for it now interestingly

429
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,860
enough we actually understand ROI very

430
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,939
very well and I hate to use insurance

431
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,459
analogies but think about your home

432
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,280
insurance your auto insurance right you

433
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,340
purchase it you get this much protection

434
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,440
for this level of investment

435
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,840
it is the most simple idea in the world

436
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,430
so I believe this is the way we should

437
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,679
be talking about ROI in the industry it

438
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:56,410
is I want a level of protection for a

439
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,270
level of investment and that's the way a

440
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,210
CSO should be talking about it with the

441
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,500
business CEO board or otherwise so if

442
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,320
you want to increase your protection

443
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,750
you spend more now of course the Devils

444
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,659
in the details there but I think

445
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,160
certainly this is the level of ROI and

446
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:16,750
the conversation the business would like

447
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,670
to be able to have with security I think

448
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,070
if we were also doing this correctly and

449
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,540
could talk about it correctly the

450
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,669
egregious pricing of a cyber insurance

451
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,780
would also go down as well and there

452
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,720
probably wouldn't be so many issues with

453
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:33,360
it potentially not being paid out but

454
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:37,710
that is for the future there's been a

455
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,820
big theme again going back to LinkedIn

456
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,280
people been talking about going back to

457
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,990
the basics and a lot of this has to do

458
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,610
with really are let's call it discussed

459
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:51,360
or wariness with a lot of the marketing

460
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:55,600
buzzwords whether that's AI

461
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,780
machine-learning blockchain automation

462
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,340
is a huge one lately and it's great

463
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,889
right obviously if you can make the

464
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,260
people and the operations more efficient

465
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,490
that's a huge win but we also all

466
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,420
understand a lot of that is just

467
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,640
marketing fluff the problem I have as a

468
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,100
veteran or the industry with back to the

469
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,590
basics is it makes me feel like we're

470
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,969
rewinding the clock every time I hear it

471
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,070
I almost feel like what are we saying go

472
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,120
back to 206 and back to that

473
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,760
defense-in-depth

474
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,120
which has ended up leading to expense in

475
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,500
depth and so if we're really getting

476
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,929
back to the basics we should be talking

477
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,970
about strategy and again quote right

478
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,850
here from the Phoenix project you get

479
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,890
what you design for what you're building

480
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,780
is the Bill of Materials for all the

481
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,520
work that you do in security operations

482
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,590
but instead of a list of parts and sub

483
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,930
assemblies like moulding screws and

484
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,550
casters you're cataloging all the

485
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:53,020
prerequisites of what you need before

486
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:54,700
you can complete the work meaning you

487
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,139
should have a strategy and I'm sure if

488
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,560
you ask us e so they're going to say of

489
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,280
course I have a strategy

490
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:05,110
what is it well we're we're an ISO base

491
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,570
shop or we we focus on NIST

492
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,010
that's not a strategy that's a framework

493
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,480
what you've explained to me when you say

494
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,000
oh we're based on ISO we're based on

495
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,140
this you're saying you have a list of

496
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,640
parts Marija Lee learned anything new

497
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,590
from frameworks over the last few years

498
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,470
have we not known what controls were

499
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,639
needed for the majority of security for

500
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:29,060
at least over a decade

501
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,370
is there anything seriously novel about

502
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,139
a framework with checkboxes that said Oh

503
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,840
have you done this do you have this have

504
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,430
you installed it have you deployed it

505
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,919
that is a list of parts that is not a

506
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,080
strategy a strategy of course includes

507
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,930
more than technology the people the

508
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,000
process the business does your marketing

509
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,140
or your legal understand what is going

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,660
to occur and how they're going to be

511
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:54,380
impacted and involved in a breach that

512
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:58,460
is a part of your strategy gonna

513
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,690
reference another analyst here that's

514
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,090
you know I'm getting old I'm really

515
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,150
changing my my style here

516
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:07,159
this one's from 2013 if I remember a

517
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,280
matter of fact the founders of duo often

518
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,020
quote this exact same image this was

519
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,879
done by Rick Holland I've thanked him

520
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,940
endlessly on Twitter Rick thanks again

521
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,250
this is a brilliant blog this is the

522
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,750
targeted attack hierarchy of needs and

523
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,900
this is when everybody was going apt

524
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,660
crazy back in 13 and you can see at the

525
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,940
top is detection and response prevention

526
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,250
all the things that we tend to talk

527
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,780
about right all the things that are

528
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,700
technology focused all the things that

529
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,340
are on those parts list of ISO and NIST

530
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,740
but at the base of this is an actual

531
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,100
security strategy and again if you

532
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,600
question if you challenge a CSO strategy

533
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,040
often that is the part that is lacking

534
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,750
fundamentally the next part right there

535
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,220
is a dedication to recruiting and

536
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,420
retaining staff and I mentioned that

537
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,950
because we're gonna come back to it here

538
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,270
in a moment but if you don't have staff

539
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,380
obviously you don't have a program

540
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,970
whether it's a program whether it's a

541
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,520
company whether it's anything right the

542
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,200
people are what matters not to mention

543
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,240
and I'm going to come back to this here

544
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,820
in a few but the part that probably cost

545
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,770
you the most is your people

546
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,330
so that strategy becomes incredibly

547
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:18,980
important because you need to be able to

548
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:20,360
track to it I don't know if any of you

549
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,420
have heard of this is the Eisenhower

550
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,699
decision matrix this is preached

551
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,160
endlessly and talked about a ton in

552
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,990
startups and I think it actually works

553
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,210
incredibly well with security programs

554
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,090
as well especially with some of the

555
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:40,070
programs that I have personally sat in I

556
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:42,679
was involved in a with a client one time

557
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,419
where they spent two weeks and this was

558
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,600
years you know a number of years ago but

559
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,800
they spent two weeks in a warm room with

560
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,379
all the people that mattered in the

561
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,520
security program chasing what they saw

562
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:57,320
was a Syria this flies killing me guys

563
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,639
they they were chasing this piece of

564
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,480
spyware that they saw thought was a

565
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,160
serious a serious breach and we came in

566
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,110
and ended up highlighting that it was

567
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,270
actually just a piece of spyware and

568
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,699
they were so excited to be in the war

569
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:13,400
room they were feeling so special and

570
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,170
urgent that they nodded their head and

571
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,910
said okay well that's good we figured

572
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,100
that out onto the next one they just

573
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:22,540
stayed in that war room went on to the

574
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,580
next one you've got to ask yourself is

575
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:27,830
something urgent is it not injured is it

576
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,629
important and you've got to ask yourself

577
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:33,860
you know or all these urgent things

578
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:37,340
actually getting in the way of the

579
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:40,149
long-term strategic vision the reason

580
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,439
why this is important is twofold I think

581
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,660
one the efficiency of how you're using

582
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:49,130
your resources so how are you using your

583
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:50,660
people and your process to the CISOs got

584
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,580
to be in a position where they have some

585
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,490
breathing room from the business right

586
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:58,010
so you need a strategy so that it can be

587
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,830
explained and defended over a period of

588
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,510
time let's take for instance a let's

589
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,050
take college football coach we're in the

590
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,200
south how often college football coaches

591
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,580
turnover pretty often right but you

592
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,810
don't come in and say oh what we're

593
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,060
gonna win the championship the first

594
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,129
year right that's not the x-bow I mean

595
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,990
they would like it if that happened but

596
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,460
no one has a serious expectation that

597
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,410
the the new coach is going to win the

598
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,929
championship first year right there is a

599
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,809
three to five year plan on

600
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,669
how that's going to occur the CSO should

601
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:30,289
be in the exact same position otherwise

602
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,869
what happens while they end up turning

603
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:35,840
over within two years because they can't

604
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:37,549
track to a strategy and plan and once

605
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,279
it's challenged or once there's a breach

606
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:42,080
and the breach was not properly

607
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,190
explained or you know in other words

608
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,289
going back to what I said earlier the

609
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:50,090
impact wasn't understood by the business

610
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:52,669
why don't you go so being able to gauge

611
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,350
how you're spending your time how you're

612
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,840
spending your effort you can always find

613
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:00,350
something to do everyone's incredibly

614
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,480
busy but being busy isn't actually

615
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,399
making anything better it potentially is

616
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,009
making things worse it can lead to poor

617
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,090
morale what if you're busy on something

618
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:10,850
that truly doesn't matter to the

619
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:14,209
business that doesn't feel good when you

620
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:17,389
find that out so what is missing what a

621
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:20,269
CISOs need to actually improve at this

622
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:24,019
what do I think as an industry we need

623
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:26,029
to be helping out with one is that

624
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:28,820
people problem so we hear this all the

625
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:30,919
time as well and it's a fun debate of

626
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,539
course to always question where these

627
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,990
things actually started and originated

628
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:38,299
but I won't go into that I will say that

629
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:42,289
if we truly are facing a skill shortage

630
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:44,119
do we think we're unique in this matter

631
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:46,669
of fact let me pick on the industry

632
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:47,899
further let me let me pull up Peter

633
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:52,009
Griffin here and talk about what really

634
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:54,498
grinds my gears how many times in this

635
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:58,279
industry have you heard security is a

636
00:25:54,499 --> 00:26:04,340
journey not a destination I would say

637
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:09,139
that is utter and complete you

638
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,720
may it is certainly a journey but you

639
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:13,008
should probably know where you're going

640
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,470
the destination should probably be

641
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:19,240
understood does any other aspect of the

642
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:24,499
business get to use that excuse does R&D

643
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,580
the sales does marketing well we're

644
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,909
going to build the product but we're not

645
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,279
going to QA it we're going to we're

646
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:32,509
gonna we're gonna build the leads but

647
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,889
we're not gonna actually talk to any of

648
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,419
them or we're going to talk to the

649
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:37,459
prospects when I can close the deals I

650
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:39,830
mean on and on and on right no other

651
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,539
aspect of the business gets to use that

652
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,449
excuse and yet here we are talking about

653
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,860
well Security's a journey it is but it

654
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,470
should be a journey to a destination

655
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:51,229
certainly the destination can change we

656
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,059
understand that business changes fine

657
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,340
but the business does need to know where

658
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:59,480
the destination is and obviously as that

659
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:02,480
changes that can be communicated I think

660
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,620
if the skills shortage is serious we're

661
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,049
obviously not going to start cloning

662
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,029
each other at least any time soon so we

663
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:09,980
should probably looking on what makes us

664
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:11,450
more efficient and if I was actually

665
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,039
going to talk about where I thought AI

666
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,370
and machine learning would actually be

667
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,350
useful that efficiency would actually be

668
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:21,709
it I don't need more red blinking lights

669
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:25,459
from AI I need AI actually helping me be

670
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:27,860
better that would be my argument again

671
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,690
this is not unique to us we should be

672
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,649
looking at other industries how many

673
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,029
times you've heard oh you know

674
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:36,469
securities like accounting before the

675
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:38,600
calculator so another great example in

676
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,149
the Phoenix project a big theme of the

677
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,158
book is the Toyota way they talk a lot

678
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:45,408
about manufacturing manufacturing is a

679
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,730
great example to look at another quote

680
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:49,159
from the book you're improving daily

681
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:53,330
work is even more important than doing

682
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,710
daily work your efficiency needs to be

683
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,720
as high as possible and so what they

684
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,870
have is total productive maintenance and

685
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,039
they've got some KPIs that are key to

686
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,289
that and of course you can google this

687
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,370
and look into it it's a it's an example

688
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:09,110
it's not a direct correlation point is

689
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,059
being able to take needless work out of

690
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,949
the system is more important than being

691
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:16,158
able to put more work into the system

692
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:19,580
and insecurity that's generally not the

693
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,049
way we think and so right now we're

694
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,189
really interested in well how good are

695
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,620
we doing we've got these silly

696
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,770
scorecards and again if they work for

697
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,479
you fantastic but just because you have

698
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,639
a metric doesn't actually mean it's the

699
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,220
metric you should be chasing or tracking

700
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,429
or does it matter to whom does it matter

701
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,230
obviously is a control owner you're very

702
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:41,840
interested let's say you're the control

703
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,190
owner of incident response you're very

704
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,408
interested in what the dwell time is

705
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:49,080
right but again does Warren Buffett care

706
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:51,660
about the dwell time yeah

707
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,379
it's a metric it's not a KPI for a board

708
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,490
member so the point is here just because

709
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,780
you have a metric doesn't mean you

710
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,950
actually report on it right so if you're

711
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,930
a CSO and you're reporting on

712
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,160
vulnerabilities patched and malware

713
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,960
blocked good luck keeping that job you

714
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,210
need to come up with KPIs that matter to

715
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,800
the business now again obviously KPI is

716
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,540
are going to change at a various level

717
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,950
as a control owner you want to

718
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,710
understand the metrics related to your

719
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,120
control as the C so you do want to track

720
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,980
those metrics and KPIs

721
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,689
in terms of how your people process and

722
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,580
Technology are performing right

723
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,100
what is your suck-ups actually doing

724
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,110
every day every week every month but

725
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,350
does the C so literally take those

726
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,120
metrics and then present those to the

727
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,870
CEO and the board and say oh yeah we do

728
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,459
stuff we work real hard again a matter

729
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,100
of fact there's a great and if you if

730
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,750
you get on YouTube and look for seaso

731
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,419
presentations to the board i've only

732
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:49,130
ever seen one i was done by john

733
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,450
Pescatore also way back when Gartner

734
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,790
really good we're totally worth watching

735
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,730
and they go through literal examples of

736
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,020
this with CISOs talking about how to and

737
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,330
what to be presenting at the board level

738
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,190
for anyone here in the practitioner

739
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,490
space I would absolutely suggest you

740
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:09,000
watch it I've been super impressed with

741
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:11,040
r-va sack because so many of the talks

742
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,720
or the people here are technical but

743
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,060
i-i've never seen especially at a

744
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,430
conference so many people being relating

745
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,040
their their technical duties and jobs

746
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:24,620
back to the business so we're obviously

747
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:28,080
getting better at this another industry

748
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,179
and maybe not the most timely one given

749
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,210
the 737 issues guys so forgive me on

750
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:38,340
that this is I believe a Boeing system

751
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:41,160
called ICAST and again you can look this

752
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,439
up on Wikipedia but think of another

753
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,590
industry that has an immense amount of

754
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,810
responsibility and with very few people

755
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,570
actually being the ones that are

756
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:53,010
responsible right commercial airlines

757
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,780
are a great example of this right

758
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,950
there's only two pilots and then there's

759
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,710
the folks in the rest of the plane

760
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:01,809
managing things but if you go back 50 75

761
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,639
years there used to be five pilots

762
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,369
and then there were three pilots and now

763
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,668
we're down to two and of course now

764
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:12,939
begin 737 right there's increased

765
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:15,279
automation and it's a great example and

766
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,989
some really good crew you know analogy

767
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,609
isn't corollaries to security there and

768
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:21,580
that was actually also covered on one of

769
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:24,009
the CSO series podcast but my point here

770
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,109
is that you really you know if we're

771
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,460
hoping to get more efficient and if

772
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:29,590
we're hoping to speak better to the

773
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,210
business we need to have things that

774
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,249
they not only understand but things that

775
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:37,330
give us the most pertinent information

776
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:40,089
that we need at any given time right in

777
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:44,349
other words if the CSO is challenged by

778
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:46,330
whomever audit legal CEO CFO does the C

779
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:49,989
so is the C so in a position where they

780
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,309
can defend an answer very quickly do

781
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:53,769
they have what they need at their

782
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,658
fingertips or are they gonna have to go

783
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:57,309
spend a month and spreadsheets and blah

784
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:58,659
blah blah and it's gonna take forever

785
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,879
or they're gonna have to call them the

786
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:02,320
big four and you know they're gonna come

787
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:04,330
in and tell them the time on their watch

788
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,668
and here hand a report and it's

789
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,949
subjective and you know you you all have

790
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:11,200
seen this before I like the idea of

791
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,779
ICAST because again it gives the most

792
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,539
pertinent information to the pilot when

793
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:19,450
they need it you can see some examples

794
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:21,190
here blue you know typical type of

795
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,259
logging stuff yellow and then you can

796
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,129
see over on the right side you know

797
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:28,509
engine oil pressure no bueno

798
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:30,968
but the dashboard aspect of this

799
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,580
industry I think we've done very poorly

800
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:35,589
and I say that because I literally

801
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,149
walked around the RSA floor and I

802
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:38,950
challenged you to do the same if you're

803
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:40,988
there next year or even at blackhat this

804
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,259
year or anything else where people have

805
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:47,080
demonstrations set up and walk around

806
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,609
and look at the products and you tell me

807
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,330
if these products look different from

808
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:54,609
each other I was blown away if any of

809
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,019
you were JavaScript developers to me it

810
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:59,339
looks like every single product and

811
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:03,339
InfoSec was built on chart Jas I mean

812
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:05,908
they all look alike so the question is

813
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:08,259
are they actually providing what we need

814
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:11,129
how many of you have seen Moneyball read

815
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:11,129
the book or seen the movie

816
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:17,340
you're probably thinking to yourself it

817
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,260
should be think differently not think

818
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,490
different but beggars can't be choosers

819
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,220
when you're stealing memes off the

820
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:26,160
internet

821
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:29,460
point is here this was a phenomenal book

822
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:32,400
phenomenal movie and it is all about the

823
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,000
way in which the Oakland A's challenged

824
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,490
baseball back in 2002-2003

825
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,040
they had a third of the budget of the

826
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:43,110
New York Yankees and so they knew they

827
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,750
couldn't keep up from a spend standpoint

828
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:48,060
so they looked at doing more with

829
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,040
analytics and they were essentially

830
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,620
looking for different KPIs to measure

831
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,129
ball players on and they did an amazing

832
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:58,290
job they made it to the playoffs and

833
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,880
everybody copied them some people would

834
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,500
argue that the Red Sox ended up winning

835
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,180
two years later because they did copy

836
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,440
that model that's up to you guys to

837
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:09,659
decide but point here is that deeper

838
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,879
analytics the qualitative quantitative

839
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:15,000
aspects of what we're doing everyday

840
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,250
need to be questioned because I'm sure

841
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,629
there is a lot of work going on is it

842
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,600
the correct work isn't the most

843
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:23,129
influential the highest ROI work it's

844
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,259
time to start questioning what we're

845
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:30,540
doing not what we're buying to this

846
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:35,010
point and kind of sticking with my silly

847
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,120
pirates the Caribbean theme and going

848
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,850
back really to the Phoenix project

849
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,460
everything has to be working in unison

850
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:45,120
so on a ship what are we actually doing

851
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:48,240
we're moving cargo right so that's what

852
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,770
the ship is protecting all week long

853
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:54,540
right we've heard risk risk risk risk

854
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:56,460
risk risk is your rudder risk is

855
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,650
fantastic but I want you to think about

856
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,680
risk like this how much money how much

857
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:04,980
investment of your overall security

858
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,759
budget is actually going into risk and I

859
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:11,880
would wager to say it's probably minor

860
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,190
compared to the cost of the ship and all

861
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,900
of the aspects of that ship the sails

862
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,590
think of these as your security controls

863
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:22,560
right so your setups is your people your

864
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,790
technology your vendor partners all of

865
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,130
these things are where your money's

866
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,610
wrapped up in it's actually a very small

867
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,320
but

868
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,080
in most cases I would I would wager that

869
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,760
the risk piece actually comes in the

870
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,910
most costly part of the security program

871
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,040
is likely your crew right so if the crew

872
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,529
on top of the ship doesn't know actually

873
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,480
how to run the sails and leverage the

874
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,950
rudder they're not going to get the ship

875
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,500
where it needs to be with that precious

876
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,029
cargo so this is the way we need to

877
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,110
start looking at sack ops this is the

878
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,300
way we need to look at a security

879
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,580
program it's not about any one piece

880
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,980
being amazing right if you have great

881
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,569
crypto what would he do but how many pin

882
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,710
test presentations have you seen where

883
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,280
they just walk in the front door of the

884
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,630
pizza box or a yellow vest in a ladder

885
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,610
and we've been seeing those for 20 years

886
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,550
right

887
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:10,230
so things have to be balanced a couple

888
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,350
more quotes I'll leave you with here

889
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:15,200
from the Phoenix project remember

890
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,000
outcomes are what matter not the process

891
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,819
not controls or for that matter what you

892
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,190
complete right so from warren buffett's

893
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,750
level all he's caring about is what is

894
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,510
the outcome what is the result what are

895
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,640
you giving me for my investment so if I

896
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,740
hand you seven million or whatever your

897
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,400
security budget is what level of

898
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,990
protection will I gain the goal is to

899
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,940
increase the throughput of the entire

900
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,100
system not just increase the number of

901
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:45,170
tasks being done again question your

902
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:49,490
metrics create KPIs that actually matter

903
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:52,290
so you can be the master of your ship

904
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:56,640
all right moving towards the seesaw of

905
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,720
2025 there's a couple aspects here one a

906
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,960
lot of people are questioning whether

907
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,870
the CSO position will even exist we saw

908
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,680
this at Facebook right no see so at

909
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,730
Facebook make any of us feel better

910
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,830
we're probably still on Facebook there

911
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:17,460
right that's the risk analysis we all do

912
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:18,930
our founder and CTO went down to the

913
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,230
local pub and had some chicken wings

914
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:23,700
ended up being terribly sick he came

915
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,110
back a few weeks later he's like hey man

916
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,520
let's go get some wings and I'm like wow

917
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,720
I'm really surprised you want to get

918
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,640
wings again he's like well you know

919
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,859
wings go well with beer I did the risk

920
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,879
analysis well you know I like the wings

921
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,830
and beer let's go get it

922
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,270
right we do that all the time very

923
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:40,529
quickly very fast obviously I think for

924
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,570
the CSO to actually

925
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,330
only exist but to continue moving

926
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,830
forward if you're doing it right you

927
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,440
know we hear this all the time reactive

928
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:53,400
versus proactive but I mean it really

929
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,290
happens security is very reactive the

930
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,880
big thing is where's the risk falling

931
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:59,759
and we heard this several times today

932
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,710
both from Barry and Charles the risk

933
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,630
needs to be at the business level not

934
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,810
the individual level that's how we

935
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:09,990
change that see so from being that

936
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,400
revolving door position I've mentioned

937
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,529
KPIs several times

938
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,910
I think obviously you've got to have

939
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,010
something to report on and that

940
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,649
something needs to be actually useful at

941
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,790
the executive level again if you're

942
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,410
reporting on patches

943
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:26,040
you know vulns patched and malware

944
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:28,920
blocked no one I'd be surprised if they

945
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,029
care I will be very interested if any of

946
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,790
you want to argue this with me though

947
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:34,650
definitely open to that and the big part

948
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,990
is the CSO actually becoming a

949
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,390
consistent and credible position this is

950
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:42,270
the goal I think for all of us for the

951
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:44,850
CSO and for anyone that is working for

952
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,040
them working with them and on the vendor

953
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,230
side you know that are selling to them

954
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,830
and wanting and looking to be you know

955
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:54,480
true partners if the CSO doesn't elevate

956
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,700
as an executive position and as an

957
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,040
executive role they will be nothing but

958
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,600
subscribers to budget that position will

959
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,820
continue to turn over at a very high

960
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,220
rate and they will continue to lose

961
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,680
respect at the executive and board

962
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:11,189
levels and you will see more Facebook's

963
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,770
not have them you will see companies put

964
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:17,970
that role under others right chief risk

965
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,680
officers general counsel you know

966
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:22,709
there's lots of people that might lobby

967
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,180
to take over the InfoSec role and of

968
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,480
course we know today there are still

969
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:31,140
many CIOs and companies that are working

970
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,300
without CISOs so I think these are the

971
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,900
things that have to change in order for

972
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,630
that role to exist and and really be

973
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,240
productive and I think useful five years

974
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,550
from now I wanted to leave you all with

975
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,529
a few resources really just things that

976
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:50,700
inspired me for this presentation again

977
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,550
this is something that I think we all

978
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,210
have to work together on the CSO's need

979
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,550
our help

980
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,960
and obviously if all of us are going to

981
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,390
be successful we need them to be

982
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,270
successful so a few things I already

983
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,609
mentioned the Forrester

984
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,230
targeted attack hierarchy of needs quite

985
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:09,029
good there's another blog that Rick did

986
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:12,119
years ago called the trouble with

987
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:14,099
tribbles and that's where he coined the

988
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,470
expense in depth which I also mentioned

989
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:20,190
a lot of these ideas are covered on our

990
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:21,509
blog for a security slash blog obviously

991
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,720
I've mentioned the Phoenix project but

992
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,460
another book I would really really say

993
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,598
if you haven't read it take a look how

994
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,960
to measure anything in cybersecurity

995
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,099
risk if you want an overflow of metrics

996
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,660
and KPIs this is a great place to start

997
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:46,140
that's it for me if there's questions

998
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:47,940
I'll certainly take them yes sir I will

999
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,348
tell you if I'm a board member what I

1000
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,570
want to know is what are we protecting

1001
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:54,690
how much are we spending and at what

1002
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:56,880
level can you protect it at I'll tell

1003
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,980
you I actually and asked Charles Tango

1004
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,470
downstairs what does he present to the

1005
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,540
board and because we were talking about

1006
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,759
security versus risk versus protection

1007
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,349
and he said at that level at the

1008
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,050
executive level it is absolutely about

1009
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:11,550
risk because they understand it so I

1010
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,830
think risk you know even though I poked

1011
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:16,560
fun at it risk is the place to start

1012
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,430
executives understand risk so that's

1013
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,040
definitely the place

1014
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,868
the obvious thing from a metric KPI

1015
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,880
standpoint is how that's going to change

1016
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:26,940
over time right so it's not about

1017
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,500
knowing where you're at knowing where

1018
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,640
you're at just means they fire you and

1019
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,109
get someone else to tell them the same

1020
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,390
thing if they don't like the answer a

1021
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:35,250
revolving door right so I think showing

1022
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:38,160
a path forward that college football

1023
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,810
analogy you've got to have a plan you

1024
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,970
got to have a business case and you've

1025
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,140
got to have a business plan and then

1026
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,899
you've got to be able to ship it you can

1027
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,020
execute to that so I think that's a big

1028
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,440
aspect of it was that - fluffy was that

1029
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:54,090
politician

1030
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,090
[Laughter]

1031
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,020
absolutely yeah and thank you checks in

1032
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,250
the mail that's exactly what we do a

1033
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,750
Pharaoh's so I could only go and depth

1034
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,700
at but I'm not gonna do a vendor pitch

1035
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,730
but certainly we can talk afterward if

1036
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,210
you like great question thank you any

1037
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,210
other questions

1038
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,279
best question is what are they serving

1039
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,610
outside shall we

1040
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,739
thank you very much

1041
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,739
[Applause]
