1
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,019
I'm Danny MacAskill and I'm a systems

2
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,360
administrator with Frederick water we

3
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,750
are a public utility located in

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,980
Frederick County Virginia which is

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,100
northwestern Virginia where Winchester

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,750
is and I'm doing this presentation on

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,780
automating information security this is

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,640
my first time at our VA SEC this is my

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,989
first security conference this is my

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,699
first time presenting but I'm Bob

11
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:52,010
there's a lot of firsts going on here so

12
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:54,979
it's very emotional for me I just want

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,089
you to know a little bit about my

14
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,769
background I've been a systems

15
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,180
administrator for about six years I

16
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:01,460
spent the first five and a half years

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,650
working in a jail as a systems

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,689
administrator so that was that was a lot

19
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,729
of fun I recently graduated from

20
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:09,979
American public university and this

21
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:15,020
presentation is sort of aspiration of my

22
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:16,939
thesis and a little bit about putting

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,950
the theory of what I was writing about

24
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,460
when I wrote the thesis into practice

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,960
with the new job that I have when when I

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,240
came to work at Frederick water they

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,359
hired me in part because I have a

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,060
security background and we have an ICS

29
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,919
system that we are heavily invested in

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,920
for obvious reasons and that we want to

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,329
make sure it's secure so they liked a

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,939
lot of what I was saying about

33
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:44,318
automation and my plans for the future

34
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,669
of how organizations can automate and

35
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,219
they wanted to put some of that into

36
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,749
practice so I'm on Twitter at foolish

37
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:52,520
underscore prof although I don't really

38
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:55,009
know how to use Twitter very well so if

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,439
you follow me it won't be that thrilling

40
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,119
and you can email me later if you have

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,458
questions at Danny dot McCasland at

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:07,520
Frederick water calm so when I was

43
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,619
approaching my thesis I started looking

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,299
at the current attacks pace the attacks

45
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,220
are becoming more complex than they ever

46
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,220
were in the past I remember when I was a

47
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,410
teenager you had to worry about viruses

48
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,060
you had these old school ideas of what a

49
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,120
computer virus was and a lot of times

50
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,430
you would get these things by having

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,810
some like floppy disk that you would put

52
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,520
into your computer and either having

53
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,500
corrupted code on it or something that

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,900
maybe someone's giving away a free game

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,750
but the free game comes with unexpected

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,270
consequences and as things progressed as

57
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,730
we moved into using the Internet

58
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,710
with the rise of web 2 oh we've we've

59
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,959
seen things like cross-site scripting

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,510
attacks and we've seen and now the

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,360
biggest thing that you can even see it

62
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,500
in our vendor space out there one of the

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,050
things that they're talking about a lot

64
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,330
is ransomware because ransomware is a is

65
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,970
a big deal it used to be if a computer

66
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,560
gets a virus you can that one computer

67
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,640
might be out for a while but now if

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,490
you've got something that can not only

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,709
encrypt that entire computer that can

70
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,270
also encrypt like every Drive that every

71
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,430
every network resource that that

72
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,670
computer is connected to you know you're

73
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,860
talking about a bad time so it's not we

74
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,369
we can't be working at space where we're

75
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,900
just like good enough and we as security

76
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,000
administration as security

77
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,500
administrators and systems

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,420
administrators in general we're all

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,160
stretched then we all have thousands of

80
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,959
to do I've never worked in a shop with

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,200
more than three people in it as far as

82
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,540
IT goes and the you know so it's hard to

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,130
maintain all of these things that you

84
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,859
have to maintain with such a small staff

85
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,240
and of course the budgets were tight and

86
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,440
every time you request new people I've

87
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,910
always worked for governments by the way

88
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,130
that every time we request new people

89
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,600
that gets denied and so you just have to

90
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,950
make do with what what you can they do

91
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,829
with and the attackers are getting more

92
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,420
organized in the current position I'm in

93
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,950
I have to worry about something that

94
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,660
I've never really had to worry about for

95
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,339
which is the advanced persistent threat

96
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,040
of course they're going to target things

97
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,209
that are behave you could if you can

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,690
target a water company where you can

99
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,910
control access to the systems over the

100
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,600
over the internet if you can turn off

101
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,490
water or you can do something to sewage

102
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,170
treatment that would end up flooding a

103
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,120
local stream with sewage I mean that's

104
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,320
critical infrastructure that we have to

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,930
worry about so even though we're a small

106
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,290
shop we have these these goal or these

107
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,690
the worries that we have two that come

108
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,840
up that we can't just take care of with

109
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:33,169
like the simple tech tool sets so I

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,109
started looking into automation I found

111
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:38,240
that according to the poem on study the

112
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,650
the security teams that automate they

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,260
have a load they see a lower cost for

114
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,669
security breaches and automation has

115
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,890
always kind of been part of information

116
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,419
security whenever we get into the nuts

117
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,490
and bolts of this one of the things that

118
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,960
is going to come up is that some lot of

119
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,979
these security controls that get

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,810
recommended

121
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,280
the National Institute of Standards and

122
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,410
Technology or things that are built into

123
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,179
the operating system itself things like

124
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,680
user control and group control and

125
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,419
access control lists and things like

126
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,380
that that we have been dealing with

127
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:08,120
since day one as IT people so the

128
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,740
industry as a whole is moving towards

129
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,150
automate and if you work in a shop where

130
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,949
you do DevOps I'm sure that there's

131
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,169
plenty of functions there that are being

132
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,300
automated with tools like ansible and

133
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:20,150
chef and puppet that these things are

134
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,789
are becoming automated daily so that you

135
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,948
can send out patches because quickly as

136
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,300
possible and automation limits mistakes

137
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,979
this is one of the reasons that I

138
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,660
approach this and I consider myself to

139
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,909
be pretty good at my job that I once did

140
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,590
a self assessment with user creation

141
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,720
just the simple task of creating a user

142
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,039
and making sure that user can access

143
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,570
everything they need to access on the

144
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,430
network and and do everything that they

145
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,419
need to be able to do and not get into

146
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,820
things that they're not supposed to get

147
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,289
into and I was at about 70% and I

148
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,120
consider myself to be pretty good at my

149
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:48,680
job but that's doing it all by hand

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,990
doing it all trying to remember the

151
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,550
entire process and there would be always

152
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,289
be something typically it was that they

153
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,050
couldn't get access when they needed it

154
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,969
but but still that's that doesn't

155
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,500
reflect well on an IT department it

156
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,180
doesn't reflect well on a security staff

157
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,220
when someone new comes to work for your

158
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,440
company and they have to wait a day or

159
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,840
two before they can say access their

160
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,389
email or log in to a specific server

161
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,000
because you have forgotten to to put

162
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,400
that information and so automation frees

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,919
also frees us up to perform higher-level

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,710
tasks if we can automate all of this

165
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,909
nuts and bolts work it frees us up to be

166
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,409
able to go to more meetings so that's

167
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:27,469
what going to work is all about right

168
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:30,530
it's having endless meetings so at least

169
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,449
that's where your boss wants you so let

170
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,340
me define what I mean by automation and

171
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,720
this is the definitions that I used in

172
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,729
the paper when I say that something is

173
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,800
fully automated I mean that it's going

174
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,710
to take information from a device and

175
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,000
it's going to process that information

176
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,900
based on a predefined set of rules and

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,389
do something else with it so this would

178
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,888
be no I mean of course there's going to

179
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,630
be a set up process for any kind of

180
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,320
automated tasks but this would be no

181
00:06:53,630 --> 00:07:01,190
user input this would just be one system

182
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,250
does something think about like if if

183
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,210
you have a task and in Windows that

184
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,500
every time

185
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,299
event happened it would send you an

186
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,889
email that's an automated task the event

187
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,350
occurs it sends an email that's fully

188
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,599
automated a partially automated task is

189
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,160
something where a human has to input

190
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,719
some information in order to make the

191
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,819
task work user creation would be a good

192
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,110
example of this we can't just

193
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,400
automatically create users because then

194
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,199
you'd have a whole bunch and amuse or

195
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,388
names and you wouldn't necessarily match

196
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,050
them up with the real users so you have

197
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,370
to have some user input in that process

198
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,610
that would be like user name Department

199
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,800
full name those kind of things machine

200
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:41,090
readable data I started to see that

201
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,860
there were aspects of automation that it

202
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,198
wasn't necessarily that the step could

203
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,000
be automated but the step could generate

204
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,780
data that could then be used by some

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,759
other system so training was a good

206
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,159
example of this everyone recommends that

207
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,710
you train your employees and your staff

208
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,210
or your co-workers well thank you

209
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,520
security training things like phishing

210
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,570
training and describing like the attack

211
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,299
space and how they can best protect

212
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,190
themselves you can't really automate

213
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,139
that process but you can automate you

214
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,520
can have a test and you can use the data

215
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,099
that comes out of that test to decide

216
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,190
say how often that you want to have them

217
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,419
retake their security finning or yeah so

218
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,310
I was looking at things like that when I

219
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:20,719
was looking at machine readable data and

220
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:25,729
there are some tasks that are just not

221
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:28,009
automatable like meetings so I looked at

222
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:31,190
I had to have some kind of way of

223
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,810
gauging what do we mean when we say

224
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,110
security controls and of course there's

225
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:37,279
confirmation bias so I could have just

226
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,140
rattled off the list of things that were

227
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,729
at the top of my head at the time things

228
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,929
that we can automate and said yeah we

229
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,579
can automate all of these things so we

230
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,560
can automate lots of stuff but I needed

231
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:47,930
some kind of a list of things to go off

232
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,750
up and so I used the National Institute

233
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:59,779
of Standards and Technology and the

234
00:08:49,750 --> 00:09:03,260
special publication 800-53 media books

235
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:05,180
20 families all of the controls are tied

236
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,260
to a security framework framework that's

237
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,420
laid out in SP 800 - 37 for how best to

238
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,660
secure your network and respond to

239
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,040
incidents so these are those control

240
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,920
families so there's a lot of them we

241
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,589
have access control

242
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,809
audit and accountability awareness and

243
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:25,259
training assessment authorization and

244
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:28,179
monitoring configuration management

245
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,720
contingency planning identification and

246
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:34,358
authentication individual participation

247
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,079
incident response maintenance media

248
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:39,790
protection privacy authorization

249
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:42,399
personnel security physical and

250
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:45,040
environmental security planning program

251
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,230
management risk assessment systems and

252
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,449
services acquisition systems and

253
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,910
communication protection and systems and

254
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:54,099
information and there will be a test on

255
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:57,040
those at the end of the presentation so

256
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,019
take a picture if you have to so and a

257
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,079
few of these uh as I was doing research

258
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,790
the things like individual participation

259
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,138
and privacy authorization were things

260
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,579
that were added between the older

261
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,019
version and the newer one and they

262
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:10,059
really kind of count for things like

263
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:13,600
your privacy policies on web pages and

264
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:18,669
and things like that so how does it all

265
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,759
look this is what I came up with the the

266
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:23,980
bar represents the fact that the those

267
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,169
particular categories can be somewhat

268
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,119
automatable to at least a certain extent

269
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:33,069
you'll see you have high marks with the

270
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:35,619
identification and authentication you

271
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:37,209
have high marks with systems and

272
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:40,089
communication protection and system and

273
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:44,018
information integrity and then the other

274
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:46,029
I think the other highest point is sorry

275
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,309
I don't even remember what these these

276
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,869
the CM is configuration management so

277
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:51,249
that's the other high point that you

278
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:53,459
have and you'll notice low points in

279
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:55,980
places where you would probably expect

280
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,719
assessment authorization and monitoring

281
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,949
that's a place where you won't have a

282
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
lot of things that can be automated

283
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:03,969
program management doesn't have a lot

284
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,949
that can be automated and some of this

285
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,629
boils down to the way they define the

286
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:10,179
security controls and the list of

287
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:12,639
security again there's 200 to 76 of them

288
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,139
so I could get it to provide a full list

289
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,949
you'd you'd really need to check out

290
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:22,329
their their documents so none of this

291
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:25,118
really was was all that surprising when

292
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:29,169
it all when it all came out we already

293
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:30,610
automate a lot access control most of

294
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:33,189
our access controls

295
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,809
at least as far as our local networks go

296
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:36,579
are going to be operating system based

297
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:38,350
controls or server based controls if

298
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,540
you're in a Microsoft shop you're using

299
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,730
Active Directory and we're a Microsoft

300
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,839
shop I can probably speak more to that

301
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,119
than I can any other so you know we're

302
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,360
using Active Directory and in systems

303
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,329
like that to do all of our access

304
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,319
controls so all of that sort of happens

305
00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:01,479
within that framework Triple A you're

306
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,549
using operating system and radius

307
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,019
controls the for the CIA framework

308
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:06,610
you're using the operating system for

309
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,759
configuration you're using things like

310
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,249
group Group Policy and chef puppet your

311
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,279
so you we already have these tools that

312
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:17,410
we've that were we've been using for

313
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,879
quite a while as I said user creation if

314
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,160
you really think about it is a security

315
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,889
task and it's something that that that

316
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,129
is automatable at least that as far as

317
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:29,199
access goes so if we look at the audit

318
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:31,230
and accountability families and the

319
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,488
identification and authentication

320
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,369
they're the most ripe for full

321
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:39,610
automation or at full and partial

322
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:41,739
automation so it makes sense because

323
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,569
they are required but are they are

324
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:46,299
handled by the operating system and they

325
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:48,939
don't require a lot of extra work so you

326
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,470
can create whenever you create users you

327
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,819
have you know what department they're in

328
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,100
you know what groups you can put them in

329
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:56,649
and least in Windows systems when you

330
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,480
can nest groups you can put someone in

331
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,829
maybe one or two groups that gets them

332
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,769
access to everything they need to have

333
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:04,359
access to and that that's something that

334
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,970
can they can easily be scripted out

335
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:13,689
using a tool like PowerShell or even

336
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:17,100
bash scripting if you if you combine

337
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:18,998
these with things like triple a and the

338
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,419
authentication authorization and

339
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:25,600
accounting fry add it you can see how

340
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:29,589
that kind of becomes easier I my

341
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,239
favorite I love the fact that when I

342
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,459
walk into work I don't have to remember

343
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:35,379
a separate password for my Wi-Fi account

344
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,689
I can just log in with the same password

345
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:39,879
that I use for logging into my computer

346
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:41,829
that's it makes it easy easier for the

347
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,809
users and you know combining that it's

348
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,439
really just a matter of having your

349
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:46,260
radius

350
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,120
we're talking Active Directory

351
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,640
configuration management nature is an

352
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,620
automated task I mean you're talking

353
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,670
about changing setting and a computer

354
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:59,500
based on you know predefined set of of

355
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,140
rules and instructions that you've given

356
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,990
it so when you think about things like

357
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,360
group policy that's an automation task

358
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,830
it's a partial automation or and it

359
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,120
actually no and if you really think

360
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,860
about it in a sense it's really fully

361
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,660
automated I think I counted it more as

362
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,310
partial automation because I was

363
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,719
thinking about you have to set up the

364
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,380
rules but once you set up those rules

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,720
once in a perfect world you've never had

366
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,800
to change them again but so I really

367
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,240
really think I probably should have

368
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,040
counted that more as a fully automated

369
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,150
task but c'est la vie right so I wanted

370
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
to look at a couple of the things that

371
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,480
were a little bit more surprising

372
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,939
systems and communication protection

373
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,430
when we look at the requirements for

374
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,780
what NIST is talking about when they say

375
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,219
systems and communication protection

376
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,380
they're talking about protecting data at

377
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,060
rest and in transit they're talking

378
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,090
about segregating functionality to

379
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,800
specific servers or subnets they're

380
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,720
talking about the separate use of

381
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,150
separation of user functionality and

382
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,340
systems management establishing

383
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,310
boundaries for public accessibility and

384
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,320
monitoring and monitor and controlling

385
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,829
communications at the exterior boundary

386
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,420
so we all do all of this right we all

387
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,150
have separate user accounts for our

388
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,010
admin tasks and our user accounts and we

389
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,600
all use separate computers right for our

390
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,920
admin tasks and our user accounts so

391
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,780
that if something was happen to a

392
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,430
computer I don't think everyone does

393
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,050
that

394
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,750
Microsoft recently recommended that we

395
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,339
all have a separate admin computer along

396
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,980
with our regular computer so we perform

397
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:33,640
administrative tasks on one and and our

398
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,300
user tasks on another and yeah I don't

399
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:40,060
see that happening any time soon so if

400
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,890
we look at automation we have intrusion

401
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,780
detection and prevention that's gonna be

402
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,310
monitoring that gateway with firewalls

403
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,199
and firewall rules that are going to be

404
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:52,020
monitoring the Gateway we have policy

405
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:56,080
based access control that can allow for

406
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,490
access to to data and all these can be

407
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,060
applied at the network level into the

408
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,920
hosts load

409
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,770
you can have host systems that do all of

410
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,699
these tasks just as well as you can have

411
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:07,300
Network level systems that are

412
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,040
performing these things system and

413
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,270
information integrity we're talking

414
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,219
about guarding against improper

415
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,230
modification or destructions and making

416
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:18,220
sure that when someone saves a file that

417
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:20,920
that file remains as it is in its safe

418
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,050
state ensuring non-repudiation and

419
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,170
authenticity so again making sure that

420
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,859
data that saved this remains the way

421
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,839
it's supposed to be flaw remediation

422
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,860
malicious code protect non-persistence

423
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,750
and memory protection and and so when we

424
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,750
look at automating these we're looking

425
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,670
at scheduled file integrity checks we're

426
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,920
looking at automating access control and

427
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,589
access logging we're looking at

428
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,360
virtualization systems monitoring and

429
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,400
memory for memory protection spam

430
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,450
protection input validation flaw

431
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,579
remediation I think the statistics are

432
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,960
showing that most of our though some of

433
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,200
the bad things that come into our

434
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,460
network are coming in through email so

435
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,949
you know things like spam protection or

436
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,699
of course very important in that space

437
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:13,060
so one thing leads to another at least I

438
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,790
think it should so I ask the question

439
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:19,720
why is it that when we discover a piece

440
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:22,180
of malware on our network that the

441
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,380
anti-malware antivirus doesn't send some

442
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,880
message to the firewall to block

443
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,430
whatever IP that came from why aren't

444
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,840
the clients communicating why are why is

445
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,030
it that when clients communicate with

446
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,340
new malicious IPS they're those clients

447
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,570
aren't being blocked out of the network

448
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,730
why is configuration management

449
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:43,330
sometimes seen as an afterthought has

450
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,280
anyone ever run into a problem in

451
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,860
something like group policy and just

452
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,420
like got tired of banging your head

453
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,280
against the wall so you just stopped and

454
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,860
said I'll do it myself

455
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,030
why why do we that that's kind of

456
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,280
looking at it as an afterthought and I

457
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,620
do it myself but why why do we do that

458
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,180
if we're if we're really serious about

459
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,729
making sure that we're secure and that

460
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,400
our configuration matches the template

461
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,700
that we want we should be a little bit

462
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,190
more or maybe I should be maybe you guys

463
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:17,860
are better than I am at all of this

464
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:19,390
but so I think we have all this

465
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,340
automation in place but we let

466
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,960
everything sit in silos so we have

467
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,840
antivirus over here and we have our

468
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,350
firewall there and we have introducing

469
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,059
protection and and detection or an

470
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,340
intrusion prevention a detection and we

471
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:35,260
have all of these little silos and we

472
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,699
don't let them communicate with each

473
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,379
other or at least they're not

474
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,600
necessarily built natively to

475
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,980
communicate with each other and now

476
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,750
there are systems in place that can help

477
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:49,270
do that and we'll discuss some of that

478
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:51,880
in in a moment but you know I think that

479
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,040
the future of this this endeavor this

480
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,419
trying to automate information security

481
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,159
it's going to involve trying to get all

482
00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:00,040
these the disparate systems to

483
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,110
communicate with each other it doesn't

484
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,030
really make sense if you know something

485
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,830
is it's happening on your network that

486
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,570
it shouldn't be happening it doesn't

487
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,220
really make sense to require some kind

488
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,620
of manual intervention to make it stop

489
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:16,120
it should be something that the system

490
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,979
itself is a panel on its own so what am

491
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,299
I talking about I'm talking about you

492
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,549
have some kind of a system health and

493
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,650
security monitoring system and I tried

494
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,330
to animate this with arrows and all

495
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,710
kinds of fancy stuff and that was the

496
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,960
point that I figured out I don't really

497
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:33,850
know they use PowerPoint so so you know

498
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,140
you have systems health and security and

499
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,360
it's informing all of these other things

500
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,610
it's informing provisioning it's been

501
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,740
forming accounting and access it's

502
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,049
informing configuration management it's

503
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,390
informing protection so if something

504
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,740
goes wrong in accounting and access

505
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,780
let's say that there's some kind of a

506
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,929
login systems health and security that

507
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,399
says that a user is that they know is

508
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,880
sitting down the hall is logging in from

509
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,870
a Russian IP that should that there

510
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,200
should be some kind of a protection

511
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:05,949
thing that would kick in and let's stop

512
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,350
that users ability to log in even if

513
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,760
it's we worried at a lot of false

514
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,918
positives but even if it's a false

515
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,990
positive even if there is some rational

516
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,669
explanation for why it's happening I

517
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,220
asked my boss to this I said let's

518
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:19,990
imagine that I saw a log that a logs

519
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,510
coming through that said that you were

520
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,250
logging in from China and that's what

521
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,570
the log is showing that you're logging

522
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,369
in from China

523
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,739
my boss has never been to China I said

524
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,899
would you rather have a system that

525
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,489
would just automatically shut down your

526
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,279
account or disable your account so that

527
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:38,350
nothing could occur and then we can

528
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,109
piece it all together later or would you

529
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,998
rather I come in at 6 o'clock the next

530
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,799
morning and see that that log is there

531
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:46,899
and then try to do something manually to

532
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,359
solve the problem three or four hours

533
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:51,699
after the initial breach may have

534
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,489
occurred and he says of course I would

535
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,489
rather the system itself shut down my

536
00:20:54,489 --> 00:21:00,429
user account and it makes sense right we

537
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:01,539
if if we're dealing with attackers that

538
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,450
are organized and we're dealing with

539
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,799
attackers that can get to us at any time

540
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,779
of the day or night we should have

541
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,220
systems in place that can respond to

542
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:11,139
those attacks at any time during the day

543
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,519
or night I know that meet that that's

544
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,988
kind of scary because it means that we

545
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,820
don't always have eyes on everything

546
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:18,700
whenever we make a decision like

547
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:22,178
disabling it out or blocking an IP

548
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,859
address but at the same time rather have

549
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,690
a few false positives than to have all

550
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,999
of our data stolen because we decided

551
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,440
that we didn't want to have to deal with

552
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,720
the the problems with the false

553
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,220
positives cause so each of these things

554
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,440
can also inform other like a

555
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,599
provisioning for instance if you if you

556
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,899
run some web servers that are that are

557
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,399
under heavy load provisioning will occur

558
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,988
but the provisioning should also trigger

559
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:46,149
configuration management so that those

560
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:48,639
servers those new servers that are being

561
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:51,849
spun up to handle that extra traffic can

562
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:54,758
get actually function properly instead

563
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:55,869
of just being empty boxes so all of

564
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,330
these things should have formed each

565
00:21:55,869 --> 00:22:00,070
other and they should also inform the

566
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,960
system health and security if you

567
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,849
imagine this being enacted it's a lot

568
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,119
more spectacular at least it was in my

569
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:08,950
head so what do we have right now we do

570
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,019
have Siemens source solutions by the way

571
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,580
have you noticed that seam is pronounced

572
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:15,729
differently depending on what vent like

573
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,379
there's a company called simplify that

574
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:19,629
calls it sim there's a company called

575
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:21,279
seamonster that calls it seem it I think

576
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,738
you can just pick however you want to

577
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,840
pronounce it so seam solutions offer the

578
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:27,399
ability to collect and manage all of the

579
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,649
organization's security information in

580
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:32,109
one location a thing that I like about

581
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,789
seam solutions is that I can I can have

582
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:36,220
all of my logs flowing into one location

583
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,169
and I can have each log it's sort of

584
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,320
informing the others so that when I'm

585
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:41,120
looking at say a fire

586
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,649
waaaagh it's not just giving me an IP

587
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,850
address and the local network that the

588
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,040
thing is communicating with it's also

589
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,070
giving me its DNS name because it's also

590
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,170
pulling information out of DNS so that's

591
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,360
it's very handy

592
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:56,060
I'm also new at my organization so I

593
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,840
don't know the IP scheme as well as like

594
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,250
my cohorts do so I have to you know

595
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,720
being able to rely on something like

596
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:07,820
that to help is it's very nice these

597
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,380
they provide visibility and linkage

598
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,610
between multiple events across multiple

599
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,740
platforms and they can correlate

600
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,810
behaviors quickly for analysis so that

601
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,150
is that is really great the first time I

602
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,190
ever tested a seem solution I found out

603
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,400
that there were a handful of users that

604
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,410
were that didn't have password reset

605
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,060
policies I know what he said about

606
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,130
earlier about password reset policies

607
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,780
but it's not even our decision to have

608
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,280
the password reset policies is actually

609
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,080
some auditor somewhere that tells us

610
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,399
that in order to pass our audit we have

611
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,600
to have a password reset policy so the

612
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,540
you know in order to make sure that we

613
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,090
would pass that audit I was able to fix

614
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,490
that problem but you know I it was

615
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,110
something that was done years ago and

616
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,320
for some reason was never changed as and

617
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,729
it was just left as an afterthought so

618
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,530
those are the kinds of things that

619
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,530
having these kind of security monitoring

620
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,090
and controls can can help with source

621
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,770
solutions provide a way for

622
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,959
administrators to automate and

623
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,670
orchestrate their behavior across

624
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,980
systems and tools so this is what I

625
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,500
really that this is sort of the goal

626
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,000
right is to have one system be able to

627
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,560
communicate with another and tell it you

628
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,780
need to do this because something is

629
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,780
happening so having your antivirus

630
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,790
vendor blocking ranges of IP addresses

631
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:24,080
that it's it's seeing malware from or

632
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:27,730
having you know a configuration

633
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,679
management be controlled by some other

634
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,480
outside system you can automate an

635
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,070
action based on behavior and you can

636
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,420
orchestrate large-scale automation

637
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,510
changes that require access to multiple

638
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:41,620
systems so it becomes really handy when

639
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:44,980
you're trying to when you're trying to

640
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,510
protect your your system in your network

641
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,100
so putting this all into practice like I

642
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,290
said when I was hired with Frederick

643
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,519
water they they said we want to do some

644
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,779
of this and then

645
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,129
I started looking at vendors and I

646
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,959
started throwing some price tags and

647
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:59,779
they said well wait a minute

648
00:24:56,959 --> 00:25:02,029
because a lot of these tools are fairly

649
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:04,609
expensive there are some free options

650
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:05,779
available for managing an organization's

651
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:08,809
security one of the things that we're

652
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:11,509
using right now is security onion we had

653
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,070
no network monitoring before we

654
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:16,099
installed security onion and it's

655
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,589
actually been fairly helpful if there's

656
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:22,700
a it's a I found it to be a fairly easy

657
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:23,899
to to start using tool and it's one of

658
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,789
these things where you can start it up

659
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,289
and start pulling in your logs and

660
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:30,859
learning how to classify things and then

661
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,209
do grow with it you're able to like

662
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:35,718
learn more about the way the tool works

663
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:41,509
and make configuration changes to make

664
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:43,579
it work for your network so automation

665
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:45,259
can be done through scripting or for the

666
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:46,969
through the use of more complex tools we

667
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:49,849
use a lot of PowerShell scripting we use

668
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:52,070
some Python scripting we different

669
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:54,259
systems will have different levels of

670
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,908
access that there that you're allowed to

671
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:57,259
have into that system for instance you

672
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:59,359
might have a vendor that's going to lock

673
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:01,940
out certain behaviors and you won't be

674
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:05,539
able to automate all tasks but you can

675
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,879
automate some differences I'm sorry I

676
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:09,769
just read that you you can start small

677
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:11,509
and work your way up to larger projects

678
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:15,409
the first automation thing that I ever

679
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:18,489
did was to send emails to users who

680
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:20,779
whose passwords were close to expiration

681
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:22,759
because we didn't have any system in

682
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,499
place to do that already so I thought

683
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:27,529
well this should be a fairly simple you

684
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:29,809
know get a date check it against uh you

685
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:32,329
know it within a week if it's within a

686
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:34,279
week we'll send you an e-mail you can

687
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:36,259
familiarize yourself with the non

688
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:38,989
security centric automation platforms

689
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:41,899
and you you have to prepare to spend a

690
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:44,119
lot of time upfront you can spend I

691
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:46,609
think I spent my entire morning writing

692
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:50,329
a script yesterday that will save me a

693
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:54,468
ton of time in the future but it took

694
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:56,658
like all morning to get it right so this

695
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:59,179
is one of my favorite cartoons I'm

696
00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:01,009
running really fast one of my favorite

697
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:02,539
cartoons I spend a lot of time on this

698
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:04,369
task and I should write a program to

699
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,910
automate it this is from xkcd I'm sure

700
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:08,209
you

701
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,920
a lot of you read xkcd because really

702
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,140
what happens as we get into this phase

703
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,640
where we think you know we can automate

704
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,810
it we we start writing the code the

705
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,580
automation takes over we have all this

706
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,960
free time but what really happens is we

707
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,399
start writing the code and then we run

708
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,960
into a problem or we start rethinking

709
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,730
the way it should work and we do

710
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,230
debugging and then ongoing development

711
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,390
and we don't have time for the original

712
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:31,010
tasks anymore you want to try to avoid

713
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:32,990
this of course you have to did that if I

714
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,060
think some of the things that he said

715
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,860
this morning kind of match you we have

716
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,720
to be sort of business centric as we do

717
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:44,120
this that's why I think the CMAs or

718
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:47,570
solutions can be very helpful the the

719
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:51,979
the biggest takeaway that I came that I

720
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:54,260
got from all of this is that you a lot

721
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,360
of these solutions that people companies

722
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,600
will offer a way that you can pay to add

723
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:02,000
certain functionality to their to to the

724
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,350
systems or or pay for a whole other

725
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,430
system that can handle things for you

726
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,639
but you can do a lot of this stuff

727
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:09,140
yourself based on task scheduler x' and

728
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,830
cron jobs and things like that to

729
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,540
perform you know we have I have alerts

730
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:17,000
that'll happen if certain events occur

731
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,270
on certain servers that where it'll send

732
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,590
emails to me informing me you kind of

733
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:26,270
wonder why a lot of that wasn't built in

734
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,949
anyway but so as far as open source

735
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,650
security controls go I know this is

736
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:35,990
really it's probably hard to read but

737
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:38,090
there's but this is this is a list that

738
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,550
I go back to you can find this they said

739
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:43,159
that the all of these are gonna be a

740
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,250
little site so you can go back to this

741
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,900
this is a list that I go back to anytime

742
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:51,200
someone comes to me and says we need to

743
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,090
do X Y or Z because usually they mean

744
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,400
that they come to me outside of a budget

745
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,770
cycle and I don't have the money to just

746
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,290
go out and buy a solution so I can at

747
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:04,250
least use one of these for a while until

748
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:06,350
I can get something better in place or

749
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,460
maybe not better maybe better it's the

750
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,540
wrong word something easier to use

751
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,320
because sometimes these can be a little

752
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:14,000
bit more difficult but they these are if

753
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,679
you're looking for security controls of

754
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
course these are options that are

755
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,970
available to you and a lot of

756
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,430
we'll have ways that you can thank you

757
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:25,550
and you can slide your food in and and

758
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:27,590
and work work between one program and

759
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,260
another to make it do what you needed to

760
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,330
do so in the past three months I've

761
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,190
spoken to at least three vendors that

762
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,639
have told me that their API is coming

763
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,380
soon

764
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,140
I had a seem vendor who we were talking

765
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,390
with and they had a very select group of

766
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,120
of inputs like they could take an input

767
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,620
from from DNS and they can take an input

768
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,070
from DHCP and they could hey get input

769
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:55,040
from like five vendors but when I asked

770
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:56,450
about you know what about other input

771
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,190
what about other vendors like if I'm

772
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,660
using a different a V vendor or I'm

773
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,410
using a different firewall vendor than

774
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,690
what you've got here

775
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,130
can we take in data from there and they

776
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,930
said well not yet because we don't have

777
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,910
our API up yet and I thought well what's

778
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,100
the use of a seam that doesn't have an

779
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,570
open API that you can punch your data

780
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,189
into I don't want to talk I don't want

781
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:16,000
to say bad things about like particular

782
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,980
vendors so I'm not gonna name names but

783
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,280
so I'm in a small company we have less

784
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,600
than 100 people working for us so

785
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,389
another thing that I've actually gotten

786
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,840
a bit lately is we usually market that

787
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:31,820
to larger socks or we're sorry but the

788
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,379
current product doesn't sell it to

789
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,220
anyone with less than a thousand

790
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,710
endpoints so and I were you know I work

791
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,420
in government I've worked in government

792
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,760
my whole career and the entire county

793
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,560
that we live in doesn't have a thousand

794
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,240
endpoints like the all of County

795
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,970
government is under a thousand endpoints

796
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,260
like that's a lot and I'm sure a lot of

797
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,780
you probably work for larger companies

798
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,990
but and from my perspective being a

799
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:59,300
small organization and I can kind of

800
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,530
understand like yeah it can be it can

801
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,300
suck to have to work with a small

802
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,920
company because you're not gonna get as

803
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,830
big of a paycheck or whatever but at the

804
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,060
same time like my secure like if you if

805
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,010
you're telling me you have the best

806
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:13,280
security whatever you have the best

807
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,750
application for this or that so I'm only

808
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,910
supposed to take second best because I'm

809
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,130
small the other factor is that being

810
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,770
part of critical infrastructure I can't

811
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:24,170
just say oh well you know we're a small

812
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,750
company I have to do something to

813
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,580
protect that the back end of this of all

814
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,650
of these systems so the fact that we're

815
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,169
small isn't it

816
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,790
sometimes works to a disadvantage for us

817
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,470
because some of the vendors don't

818
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,080
necessarily like to take us seriously in

819
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,070
the automation space or that feature

820
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,230
cost extra

821
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,030
this is something I've you know I think

822
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,210
that you could you could talk about a

823
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:50,120
sort of ghettoization of information

824
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,790
security because you have some with

825
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,459
particularly with the some modern

826
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:58,250
systems where you have the the cloud

827
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,890
sharing the cloud based systems you're

828
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,850
now paying extra for things that would

829
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,610
have just been part of your network

830
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,409
before I said I wouldn't name names but

831
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,969
I'm gonna name names office 365 comes to

832
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,670
mind because you can't protect office

833
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:13,730
365 in the same way that you protected

834
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,560
your on-prem solution because obviously

835
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,880
it's in the cloud you can't use firewall

836
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,679
rules you have to come up with some

837
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,550
other way of protecting it and Microsoft

838
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,070
and will of course

839
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:24,169
upsell you a protection package for that

840
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,210
but you it's it's something that I

841
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:28,070
actually kind of worried about because

842
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,830
are we now going to create start

843
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:34,010
creating some environment where only the

844
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:35,300
people who can really afford the to add

845
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,340
all these extra features to their

846
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,350
security platform are able to add it

847
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,580
operating systems came with the ability

848
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,639
to use passwords because they were a

849
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,020
necessity for security but now that

850
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,060
we're now now that we're saying that

851
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,650
passwords are kind of overrated and we

852
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,230
need to move on to something else they

853
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,880
want to sell us on here's the something

854
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,290
else that you have to buy that's Pierce

855
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,060
still going to run this password system

856
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,460
that we're that we're telling you is

857
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,629
inherently insecure but we're gonna try

858
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,340
to upsell you on something that will

859
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,750
that will actually help secure you so

860
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,810
that's a different soapbox for a

861
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:07,010
different time and if I haven't

862
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,020
alienated every vendor in the place

863
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:14,750
maybe I can come back next year and I'll

864
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:17,120
talk about it but so so moving forward

865
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,980
the things that that I'm trying to keep

866
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,270
in mind within our organization any time

867
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,490
we talk with a vendor I want to make

868
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,230
sure that they they take the idea of

869
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,930
security automation Siri so you remember

870
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,060
back when we used to have to tell people

871
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,190
writing code like think about security

872
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,810
as you write your code we have to think

873
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,640
about we as security professionals have

874
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,169
to think about automation as we start

875
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,370
buying security packages instead of

876
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,760
thinking about it it's an afterthought

877
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:42,889
it you know it would really it sometimes

878
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,240
is it's heartbreaking because you get

879
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,550
really into a product and then you say

880
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
hey

881
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,970
what about automate tenon oh we can't do

882
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,150
that yet or that's coming later down the

883
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,220
road but it's gonna save you a lot of

884
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,510
headache if you already if you're

885
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,490
working with vendors that are already

886
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,690
taking that that's seriously even if

887
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,280
it's something where you have to go into

888
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,870
the API and do the work yourself at

889
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,379
least if it has an open API for you to

890
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,169
do that

891
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,580
you have that ability we need to treat

892
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,260
automation as part of the security

893
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,239
framework and not as an afterthought

894
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,820
that's that's I think really the key

895
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,459
takeaway if we can if we can do that I

896
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:18,990
think we will will will actually become

897
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:21,330
like better as a as an industry I have

898
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:24,659
this theory that's completely not

899
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:27,330
evidence-based but that IT security

900
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,750
works somewhat like the idea of herd

901
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,270
immunity like the more we can secure all

902
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,010
the the disparate systems the less

903
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,509
likely it is that the vendors are going

904
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,490
to or that that the bad guys are going

905
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,980
to be able to get a foothold anywhere

906
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:43,409
because of this the sense that if you

907
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,460
can if most people are protected against

908
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,250
something well they're going to stop

909
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,530
trying to trying to exploit it maybe I'm

910
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,449
completely wrong but but I think that

911
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,190
there's something to that support

912
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:55,500
open-source developers in the security

913
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,020
and automation space because as we

914
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,790
support open-source developers they they

915
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,610
put out new things onto the market and

916
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:06,330
those things end up ultimately working

917
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:08,000
their way into into the the paid vendor

918
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:11,819
space and it of course drives down costs

919
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,740
I think the perfect example of that is

920
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,530
web browsers the first web browser that

921
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:20,250
did tabs was an open source web browser

922
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:23,310
right so and then now you can imagine a

923
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,500
web browser without tabs so and then

924
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,090
utilize available automation solutions

925
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,980
if you have the ability to automate it

926
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,450
automate it you shouldn't be spending

927
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,160
your time is too valuable you shouldn't

928
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,140
be spending your time trying to move

929
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,690
from one system to another and trying to

930
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,850
- tell it to do something that a machine

931
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,580
could tell it to do so use your time

932
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,900
more wisely set up that take the time to

933
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,299
set up those automated solutions that

934
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,880
are already built into your network and

935
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,140
you know let them roll and sure you're

936
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,880
going to deal with false positives but I

937
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,440
think in the end you're gonna come up

938
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,170
with a more secure environment and you

939
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,880
will be you'll be better off for it so

940
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,330
are there any questions anyone want to

941
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,330
throw things at me

942
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,580
you mean like what task has been the or

943
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:43,130
I have found we've we've tested two

944
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:45,560
source solutions so far and I found that

945
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,390
to be like really really nice because

946
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,040
most of the time the works already been

947
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,270
done for you beforehand like all of

948
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
those all of the scripts that you would

949
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,830
need to run I've already sort of been

950
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,250
built and so you just plug in your your

951
00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:00,860
company's information and it's able to

952
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,810
move data and move behaviors back and

953
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:07,940
forth as you see fit

954
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:09,860
so the the source systems that we have

955
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,630
tried use there are automated based on

956
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,840
like playbooks kind of like ansible and

957
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:17,270
so you you know you're able to just kind

958
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,450
of if you're using for Dannette you put

959
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,950
your net data in it or like information

960
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,109
for how to log in and those kind of

961
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,120
things and then it's able to to take the

962
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,730
that information and and you know

963
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,350
through the play books to to do things

964
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,500
so that's the like the easiest way to do

965
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,930
it it's also the most costly being a

966
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,090
window shop I use a lot of PowerShell so

967
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,350
I have a lot of things where if an event

968
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,520
occurs of Howard's shell scripts will

969
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:42,380
run and that it'll send me an email

970
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,730
telling me it did something and that's

971
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,230
another thing that I would I would

972
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,800
highly recommend it as you as you start

973
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,090
the space throw in that like send me an

974
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,350
email to let me know that it did

975
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,580
something after a while you're gonna

976
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,680
want to get rid of those because you're

977
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,710
gonna be inundated with email so that

978
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,180
your automated systems are sending you

979
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,420
and you that's the last thing you need

980
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,190
as well but at the in the beginning it

981
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,110
can be very helpful first of all to know

982
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,930
that your automation is running properly

983
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:10,850
and second of all if you're making

984
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:13,460
mistakes it's the quickest way to catch

985
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,380
them so if you end up blocking an IP

986
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,110
range say in your firewall that you

987
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,280
didn't really want to block but because

988
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,530
of some weight because of the way you

989
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,380
wrote the code it misinterpreted what

990
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,490
you really meant the you know it's the

991
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:32,180
quickest way to catch those kind of

992
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:35,078
mistakes so anything else okay well

993
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,140
thank you very much appreciate

994
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,140
you
