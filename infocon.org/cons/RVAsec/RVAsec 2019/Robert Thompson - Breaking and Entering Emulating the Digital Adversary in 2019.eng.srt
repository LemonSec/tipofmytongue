1
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,260
arted first and foremost I recognize the

2
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,599
only thing standing between you and

3
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,850
lunch is this presentation I give and

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,470
how quickly I get it done good news for

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,850
you as I've ingested about 500

6
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,980
milligrams of caffeine today source and

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,930
I talk really fast so chances are we'll

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,360
finished sooner than later a quick show

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,699
of hands how many of you attended Jason

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,400
Hills anatomy of a Red Team assessment

11
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:48,150
yesterday so pretty much everybody okay

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,460
good

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,239
entertaining educational and dare I say

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,860
inspiring

15
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,239
good stuff it's a little background

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,050
story on that Jason is the branch chief

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,909
of MCATs

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,830
I'm his deputy we work together we we

19
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:01,140
talk pretty much every day but somehow

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,089
we both managed to submit an abstract

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,379
for our VA sec and get approved for this

22
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,070
conference without the other person

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,950
knowing so a lot of what you hear me say

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,699
today one said yesterday and a lot of

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,229
the slides you see that said I'll go

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,000
through you at law office have seen

27
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,380
yesterday that's mainly because when I

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,290
gave Jason the slide deck for peer

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,420
review he pretty much stole all my ideas

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,280
um one other thing we're bringing up I

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,930
was looking at the audience just a

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,850
little bit ago just thinking about how

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,530
great it's been these last couple days

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,020
to interact with so many so many nice

35
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,100
Pleasant people at this conference I say

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,509
this because the last conference I

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,548
attended in Las Vegas where I wore my

38
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,170
DHS shirt within about 10 minutes of

39
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,390
arriving at said conference which will

40
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,490
remain nameless I hear somebody yell

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,409
take this you miserable stinking effing

42
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,298
fed well he didn't say effing and as her

43
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,740
turn to acknowledge this warm and

44
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,539
friendly greeting by this individual and

45
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,449
boom boom get pummeled by the two

46
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,159
bananas that he threw at me clearly this

47
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,780
person just did not like the fact that

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm just a measly civil servant

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,049
representing the federal government

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,249
point is this it's nice to be at a

51
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,340
conference where I'm not being assaulted

52
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:07,920
by fruit thank you and have we you know

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,669
and one other thing just comments not

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,710
kick-ass a quick round of applause

55
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,560
[Applause]

56
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,460
you know it's it's it's not so small

57
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,690
where it's awkward

58
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,220
have you been to those it's like 1012

59
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,900
people are staring around like this but

60
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,630
it's not so big or you're getting lost

61
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,300
in the shuffle so good stuff all right

62
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,519
today I am going to talk with you a

63
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,140
little bit about hackers I'm not talking

64
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,300
about the stereotypical hacker that you

65
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,390
envision sitting in a dark room wearing

66
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,770
a hood or a weird mask or or maybe some

67
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,299
of those stock photos the fun have you

68
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,770
seen the one with the person wearing the

69
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,800
ski mask pointing the gun at the laptop

70
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,140
okay not that we don't do that okay we

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,790
find that ineffective we ever hit a wall

72
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,320
with you know brandishing a knife tends

73
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,760
to do the trick alright I'm not talking

74
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,829
about that if you haven't heard of any

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,820
cats before and you do a quick search

76
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,380
front of us you're gonna get a whole

77
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,859
bunch of surgeons a whole bunch of

78
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,269
results ignore the first one you see

79
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,250
that's by it's an article written by a

80
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,110
very well-known cybersecurity

81
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,250
journalists slash blogger I'm sure

82
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,900
you've all heard of him I'm sure he's a

83
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,760
lovely individual nothing against him or

84
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,590
the article it's just old outdated an

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,480
archaic filled with inconsistencies and

86
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,950
some accuracies or really if you want

87
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,200
doesn't matter anyway taking a step

88
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,010
further I'm gonna share with you how we

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,619
at DHS emulates the adversary against

90
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,780
government agencies federal local state

91
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,130
territorial tribunal including private

92
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,160
sector and critical infrastructure

93
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,590
organizations across the country we run

94
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,200
the gamut our customers range everybody

95
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,540
from cabinet level departments CFO act

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,220
agencies chemical sector finance

97
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,440
agriculture water industrial control

98
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,380
systems very very soon we are going to

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,160
be putting a significant emphasis on

100
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,049
elections because there's a thing

101
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,790
happening next November that's kind of

102
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,350
important so we're gonna do what we can

103
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,630
to work with as many secretary the state

104
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,430
offices in the country so we can ensure

105
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,710
that the integrity of our election

106
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,570
infrastructure is safe sound and secure

107
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,030
doing our little part to ensure that

108
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,329
democracy is safe again kind of

109
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,410
important um I ran into a couple minor

110
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,360
challenges when putting this

111
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,760
presentation together um the first was

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,620
resisting the urge to do too deep of a

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,750
technical dive the organizers of this

114
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,000
conference were kind enough to put this

115
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,170
presentation in the business track which

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,730
is perfect for me because I'm very

117
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,500
non-technical Jason did the technical

118
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,090
stuff yesterday so it's perfect that

119
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,850
we're kind of doing the non-technical

120
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,810
piece when if you're like me and you

121
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,600
kind of lay in bed at night thinking

122
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,780
about adversary emulation

123
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,430
how did Cody Bear execute that payload

124
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,229
on the network you know you think about

125
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,090
the operators behind the keyboard right

126
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,760
it's the magic that they work

127
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,409
it's the TTP's that they employ to be

128
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,349
successful that's adversary emulation

129
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,580
but you can't have a successful team if

130
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,470
you don't have a lot of magic happening

131
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,020
behind the scenes those those those

132
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,700
standard no consistent repeatable and

133
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,590
quantifiable methodologies there's

134
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,760
processes policies and procedures so I'm

135
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,859
gonna step back and share with you how

136
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,960
we do what we do kind of behind the

137
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,990
scenes that will talk a little technical

138
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,640
a little tactical a little procedural

139
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:09,100
but I don't want to share with you what

140
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:12,490
allows us to be successful in cats we

141
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,410
strive to be a one-stop shop for all

142
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,970
things mobility scanning and penetration

143
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,340
testing we have a vast array of services

144
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,900
at the end of the day we conduct

145
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,669
cybersecurity assessments that

146
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,239
proactively identify risk and collect

147
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,220
the data necessary that allows the HS to

148
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,010
make informed data-driven decisions that

149
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,450
will make a positive impact on our

150
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,460
nation's cybersecurity infrastructure

151
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,740
one point I want to make we are we've

152
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,210
just recently realigned we're now called

153
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,860
the cybersecurity infrastructure and

154
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,770
security agency so we're at the same

155
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,470
level as like a TSA a FEMA Coast Guard

156
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,659
CBP which is allowing us to make I think

157
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,200
a bit more of a broad and comprehensive

158
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,220
impact to the landscape across the

159
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,750
government and this is one of the

160
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,860
stipulations of us speaking here we do

161
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,820
kind of have to share what what our

162
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,500
services are so we we are not

163
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,390
intelligence we're not military we're

164
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,550
not law enforcement and we're regulatory

165
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,010
which means we cannot and do not tell

166
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,620
anybody what to do if there's a if

167
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,050
there's an issue somewhere and okay hey

168
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,160
fix this fix this this group policy you

169
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,690
know you gotta you got to patch that

170
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,850
system and something breaks they're

171
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,620
gonna - I still didn't just do that so

172
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,040
we don't tell anybody what to do or how

173
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,360
to do we form collaborative partnerships

174
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,800
with the community with our stakeholders

175
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,750
with the system owners with the

176
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,520
innovators with the scientists decision

177
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,260
makers and policy makers so we can help

178
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,580
them identify the risk hopefully

179
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,430
mitigate that risk in the future we were

180
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,020
very much on your side we want to help

181
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,750
and we genuinely want to help and we

182
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,140
want to do what we can again to minimize

183
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,080
the attack surface

184
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,690
across the community and think about

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,219
your organization's and and the types of

186
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,830
risk that exist and the list is long and

187
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,050
painful right you've got power outages

188
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,380
you can't control and you know human

189
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,750
error

190
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,760
maybe data breaches you can't control

191
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,860
that there's one variable that you can

192
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,870
control right that's vulnerability if

193
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,370
you can manage and understand your

194
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,170
vulnerability you can end up turning

195
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,590
risk into advantage because it is not

196
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,610
about risk elimination it's about risk

197
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,080
mitigation and risk management and

198
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,640
you're gonna hear the term risk many

199
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,289
many times throughout this presentation

200
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,659
because that's one of our primary

201
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,340
focuses is minimizing risk because we

202
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,990
can't change the world we can drive to

203
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,549
strive to make change but we're not

204
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,510
going to change everything in one fell

205
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,560
swoop but that is one of our goals been

206
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,880
around for the better part of the last

207
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,550
ten years and probably saw this slide

208
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,070
yesterday a number of our services all

209
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,480
of which are free to the community if

210
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,030
you're interested if you're if you're a

211
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,230
member of a government agency private

212
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,820
sector critical restructure raise your

213
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,200
hand and we'll gladly hook you up

214
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,680
cyber hygiene is one of our more popular

215
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,099
services we have the better part of

216
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,860
1,200 customers in fiscal year 18 alone

217
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,850
we helped mitigate 250,000 externally

218
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,550
vulnerability externally facing

219
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,720
vulnerabilities that's a huge slice of

220
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,280
the attack surface there's no longer

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,070
there okay our risk and vulnerability

222
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,539
assessment that's a two week gig first

223
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,070
weeks off-site at our lab in Arlington

224
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,110
second week is on-site at a customer

225
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,969
location this is this is applicable to

226
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,640
emulation because it's how we do what we

227
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,230
do that emulation piece that for the

228
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,210
risk and vulnerability assessment we do

229
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,610
our best over the course of a week to

230
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,770
emulate a real-world adversary when we

231
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,990
go on on-site or emulating come that

232
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,669
rogue user insider threat can remote

233
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,020
pentest that's a one week's engagement

234
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,760
external scanning port scanning valen

235
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,440
scanning web app scanning and then we

236
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,659
test a multitude of payloads with the

237
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,799
customer to ensure to see which ones

238
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,780
execute which ones don't

239
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,250
validated architecture design review

240
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,679
that's evaders jason mentioned yesterday

241
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,590
we Star Wars fans here that's tabletop

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,449
QA we look at the config files look at

243
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,430
the security design and see how they

244
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,140
they they match up to industry best

245
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,750
standards okay with phishing campaign

246
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,209
assessments you do critical product eval

247
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,670
it's kind of a debauch security

248
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,189
understand Kanna where those issues I

249
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,229
before they're released to the public

250
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:01,118
working with voting machines right now

251
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,939
and some aviation and we also have a red

252
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:05,619
team that's a true 90-day engagement to

253
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:07,240
keep that as an option something to

254
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:12,339
think about for the future our goals

255
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,949
I have many reduce respond inform detect

256
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,689
respond react conquer destroy at the end

257
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:17,979
of the day we want to minimize the

258
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,480
attack surface identifies many

259
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,819
vulnerabilities as we can and keep our

260
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,350
customers off the front page of a major

261
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,368
newspaper because of a data breach that

262
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,889
could have been prevented with some

263
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:28,809
basic cyber hygiene and simple tweaks to

264
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:30,519
their security configurations we all

265
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:32,829
know that's an issue if you can just do

266
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,040
some of the 101 stuff I'm pretty sure

267
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:38,109
you're going to be in good shape

268
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,360
some are our success stories we do the

269
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,800
Super Bowl every year okay we are

270
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,839
working closely with elections we were

271
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,579
featured on NBC Nightly News a couple

272
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,319
few months ago that's our lab kind of

273
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,050
nondescript it's not this impressive

274
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:51,639
massive room that you'd think it would

275
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,199
be these guys just need a folding table

276
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,850
or a laptop and they're good to go and

277
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:57,189
then we work with the local and state

278
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,139
organizations to let them understand

279
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:01,839
where the issues reside this may seem

280
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:04,449
harmless and minor you've probably seen

281
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,420
the signs before zombies ahead you know

282
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:10,089
free tacos next exit not a big deal but

283
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,439
it's at public trust if you if you lose

284
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,569
that public trust and there's actually

285
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:15,748
an issue they may ignore it so those are

286
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:19,299
the kind of issues that we help identify

287
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:21,670
um threat emulation comparison I'm

288
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:23,559
really sorry this has been beaten to

289
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,649
death this week Jason talked about it we

290
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,490
had another session yesterday about

291
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:29,410
vulnerability and penetration testing

292
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,179
but it's important I think for our

293
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,549
purposes today that we define a clear

294
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:35,170
delineation of the terms we live

295
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,269
breathing Etha stuff every single day

296
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,399
write to us it's obvious it's second

297
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,049
nature kind of take it for granted but

298
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,610
how many people with whom you've spoken

299
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,589
over the years to just don't get it

300
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,360
Multi vulnerability scans and that okay

301
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,399
you have to scan so when you come

302
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,519
on-site to test our web apps and our

303
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,619
database that's not part of it so these

304
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,019
terms are I think especially pen testing

305
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,579
the red teaming they're conflated can

306
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,660
use interchangeably or amalgamate it

307
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,059
don't even know what that word means it

308
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,999
was just fun to write I've talked to

309
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:05,520
people before I talked to a somebody a

310
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:07,140
couple few months ago

311
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,279
he had this really cool title it was

312
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,720
advanced ops red cell extreme yeah you

313
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,670
guys must do some really cool stuff you

314
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,820
know tell me about what you do so God

315
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,020
just use that map deport scans that's

316
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,550
cool if you want to call yourself that

317
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,350
I'm not gonna judge you very much

318
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,529
someone's gonna call you out at some

319
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,060
point so so for him that works but for

320
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,500
our purposes like we're gonna kind of go

321
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,790
through it real quick I'm speaking of

322
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,610
end that you all know the story between

323
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,949
the developer of nmap and the movie The

324
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,720
Matrix anyone see the matrix remember in

325
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,610
the matrix

326
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,080
Trinity one of the main characters fires

327
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,180
up end map and I think she tries to

328
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,240
launch an SSH shell somewhere remember

329
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,029
that I'm seeing a lot of nothing that

330
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,580
happens okay yeah so kind of cool so the

331
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:53,070
developer of of a van map was super

332
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,690
psyched about this because the world's

333
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,130
most popular movie he's using his tool

334
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,170
so he does what anything else would do

335
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,100
he grabbed a screenshot put it on his

336
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:04,500
website pretty good next day he goes out

337
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,200
sees a high priority overnight letter

338
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,580
sitting on his doorstep from Warner

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,680
Brothers Studios lawyers telling him to

340
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,470
cease and desist because they used to

341
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,790
screenshot without permission so Fiona

342
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,410
goes okay expletive expletive errs you

343
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,060
want to dance let's dance so he sent his

344
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,110
own little better overnight high

345
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,609
priority today I'm saying

346
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,640
you used my tool without my permission

347
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,529
so let's start with giving me 10% of the

348
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,959
royalties and take down every movie

349
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,670
you've ever released you got a letter

350
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,260
the next day overnight high priority

351
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,380
from Warner Brothers Studios lawyers are

352
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,720
saying you can keep the screen shot so

353
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,120
when one for the good guy that's that's

354
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,350
off target I'm sorry I'm way that's

355
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,779
gonna happen a couple times in it a

356
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,360
couple caveats what we do is not

357
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:51,180
proprietary it's it's nothing you

358
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,649
haven't seen before it works for us I'm

359
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,660
not a pen test or a red teamer I just

360
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:57,270
worked with many awesome good people who

361
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,790
do this and I want to share what we do

362
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:02,370
how we do or very transparent so if

363
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,810
you're if you're looking to build some

364
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,339
sort of threat emulation capability

365
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,589
hopefully you can walk away with some

366
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,660
some solid takeaways if you have a team

367
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,740
already if you're looking to enhance it

368
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,430
maybe there'll be a couple of nuggets

369
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:18,510
that you have yet considered so moving

370
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:21,329
on we lost our loss of thing

371
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,769
here we go okay bowbully assessment

372
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:24,209
pretty straightforward I don't think

373
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:27,980
there's much confusion on what this is

374
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:30,510
automated tool against the defined scope

375
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,449
set and forget for the most part it's

376
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,110
automated sometimes manual where are

377
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:35,519
your issues where are your

378
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,139
vulnerabilities I don't think it gets

379
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,630
more simple than this does anyone not

380
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,769
know this I maybe not I don't know again

381
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,339
I've talked to a lot of people who just

382
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,120
don't get it

383
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,290
okay figure out where the issues reside

384
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,860
provide some kinds on how to mitigate

385
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:53,069
them

386
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:54,660
and then move on as far as our cyber

387
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,550
hygiene and services go this is just a

388
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,550
quick screenshot of our dashboard this

389
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,620
is what we see this is a bit archaic an

390
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,359
old look at seven-thirty behind us it

391
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,250
shows the the number of vulnerabilities

392
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,199
that we have based on severity number of

393
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,269
reports delivered and if you are a

394
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,459
customer of this you get a nice tidy

395
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:13,139
report sent to you every week digestible

396
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,500
from everybody technical staff all the

397
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,990
way up to sea level this is the future

398
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,240
some really nifty clever data

399
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,889
visualization we're doing here I think

400
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,569
it's pretty sweet and the idea here is

401
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,399
we're gonna we're gonna put this out

402
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:27,349
somewhat publicly so if you're a sector

403
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,990
specific agency

404
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,610
say your water or I don't know chemical

405
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,730
and you want to see where the issues

406
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,380
reside in your particular sector you can

407
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,639
login it'll be all anonymized and

408
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,260
sanitized but you'll be able to see

409
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,760
where the issues are so you can figure

410
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,279
out kind of you know where to make your

411
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,269
risk informed decisions think of

412
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,439
something else I don't know I thought I

413
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,389
met somebody from the maritime industry

414
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,889
yesterday how often do you think of the

415
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,990
maritime industry and the shipping ports

416
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,279
I don't think at all until I remember

417
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,680
that Wired magazine article last year

418
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,000
about mercy if you hadn't read that man

419
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,920
that's that's a thing he's like a movie

420
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,600
that's some scary stuff you don't think

421
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,569
we take it for granted and how how much

422
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,949
we kind of rely on the shipping ports of

423
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,569
our country in the cross the world

424
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:07,800
so maybe the maritime industry wants to

425
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:11,849
see where the issues are so that they

426
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,760
can mitigate it in advance pen tests

427
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,839
this is vulnerability centric it's going

428
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,329
to help customers identify the

429
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,310
vulnerability is that a scan did not

430
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,229
pick up usually short it's very loud

431
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,849
very noisy kind of like a bull in a

432
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,370
china shop knocking things over setting

433
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,050
off alarms the sock knows we're there

434
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,380
the defenders know we're there we know

435
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,939
they know and

436
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,920
provides a little bit of entertainment

437
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,540
value any-any uh pen testers in here

438
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,670
which is a couple I always find it funny

439
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,189
when you get that knock on the door hey

440
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,740
guys you're busted totally see what

441
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,890
you're doing okay so go ahead and stop

442
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,270
like we want you to see what we're doing

443
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,650
so that that that goes without saying

444
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,770
that's by design

445
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:57,290
the goal here should not be but

446
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,050
sometimes is but should not be primarily

447
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,219
to get done me an admin enterprise admin

448
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,530
if that's a byproduct for what you're

449
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,460
doing awesome but that should be the

450
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,630
only goal I'm gonna find as many

451
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,520
weaknesses deficiencies and

452
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,189
vulnerabilities as you can so that your

453
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,780
customer can hopefully eliminate attack

454
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,740
path before it's exploited by a

455
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:19,100
malicious actor

456
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:21,440
so again vulnerability centric red

457
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,320
team's um low and slow these guys are

458
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,800
like the ninjas our red team is a 90-day

459
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,290
assessment broken into two phases about

460
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,359
60 days in trench and assess where they

461
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,910
establish the foothold and do their kind

462
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,110
of their recon maybe their enumeration

463
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,290
the last thirty days they do something

464
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,390
called measurable events where they

465
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:45,079
maybe add a file to a system at a user

466
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,350
to a group the desktop background all

467
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,820
the way up to a ransomware splash screen

468
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,500
that the customers or that some of the

469
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,600
users will get just to see how they

470
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,570
respond testing the people processes and

471
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,850
procedures and technologies of an

472
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,140
organization how well is your sock

473
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,510
working how well is your incident

474
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,459
response plan working by and large this

475
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,750
is black box maybe one or two people

476
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,760
know about it so the team will do their

477
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,490
recon much differently than of or they

478
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,230
excuse me a penetration team well and

479
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,849
that's one of the other challenges I

480
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:21,170
faced how a penetration tester emulates

481
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:22,429
the adversaries are very different than

482
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,350
how our red teamer does and very

483
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,180
different how vulnerable dscan does is

484
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,909
vulnerability scanning threat emulation

485
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,100
I think that I think the knee-jerk

486
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,570
reaction would be no but then you get

487
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,850
the argument well doesn't the adversary

488
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,350
scan for vulnerabilities if you're

489
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,280
looking at your IDs alerts if you have

490
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,719
it tuned in the right way you're gonna

491
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,610
see a whole bunch of people scanning for

492
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,820
a whole about vulnerabilities so I see

493
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:46,399
the argument so how each team

494
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,960
each component does their particular in

495
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
relation piece is going to be different

496
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,040
so I'll try to touch on as many of those

497
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,810
as I can so a lot of solid information

498
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,490
that can be gleaned from this type of

499
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:03,760
test one thing that to note this is a

500
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,410
pretty intense exercise for the red team

501
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,110
because it is because it is so long and

502
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,550
it is so low and slow so should you be

503
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,110
doing a red team against an organization

504
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,270
that's never had a pen test or a

505
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,820
vulnerability scan no because it's gonna

506
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,290
be a huge massive mess that's one thing

507
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,939
we try to emphasize like if a customer

508
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,110
requested the what else hey you first

509
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,000
you got to do this then you got it

510
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,290
through this other thing

511
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,390
maybe the pen test for a couple times

512
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,220
get your maturity up to speed then we

513
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:32,890
can move on to a red team if they're if

514
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,850
they're eligible so why am you late

515
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,230
we're gonna spend about five minutes on

516
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,719
every single one of these topics behind

517
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,460
me no we're not kidding pick your reason

518
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,720
the first question we always ask is why

519
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,100
why do you want a pen test why do you

520
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,250
want to read scene what do you want to

521
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,030
get out of it so we can kind of tailor

522
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,110
our operations to meet that need

523
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,730
and it for us it's obvious and it's

524
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,620
obvious we know what the value is gonna

525
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,270
be but we often get argument from the

526
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,270
customer we don't need this type of

527
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,740
thing right we already do our cursory

528
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,139
vulnerability scans we have quarterly

529
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,530
phishing we have our annual IT security

530
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,390
refresher how valuable is that right and

531
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,730
maybe they have a strong compliance and

532
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,850
policy program all of which are fine and

533
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,690
good but at best those offer I think a

534
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,820
theoretical articulation on the

535
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,290
vulnerability whereas say a pen session

536
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,330
or a red team is going to demonstrate I

537
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,790
think more more value in terms of

538
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,730
perceived and real threats which is more

539
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,460
demonstrable and compelling to the IT

540
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,990
staff to the c-level so come up with

541
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,150
your reason understand what it is be

542
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,800
consistent and have that kind of

543
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,810
consistent repeatable message to your

544
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:44,120
people who might not get it so emulation

545
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:46,159
101 pretty straightforward I think it's

546
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,639
very obvious to us what it is you are

547
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,290
allowing an ethical authorized attacker

548
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,890
the person who knows what they're doing

549
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,180
on your network

550
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,080
identify as many deficiencies weaknesses

551
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,840
as you can so what are the last

552
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,178
learn what assets got breached what

553
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,760
users got affected walk away with a

554
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:08,490
clear concise defined report of what

555
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,460
that was a couple couple pieces I want

556
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,440
to emphasize here the logging the

557
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,269
communication and the collaboration log

558
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,760
everything you do we log everything we

559
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:20,429
just had a request from I think 2016

560
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,929
that somebody asked a situation on a

561
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:25,169
network but there was some confusion

562
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:27,360
about a thing we went back to our logs

563
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:28,919
pointed it out gave the answer you don't

564
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,830
have that those logs you don't have that

565
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,080
information already stored up so you can

566
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,529
kind of resort to it later might get you

567
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,559
some trouble

568
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:40,500
the collaboration is key teach learn and

569
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,928
repeat so that process the emulation

570
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,130
process is I mean adversary emulation

571
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:53,519
test and measure defense and then report

572
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:56,039
review and follow-up so the moving on to

573
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,049
kind of how we collaborate we use cobalt

574
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,299
strike as our emulation and

575
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,070
collaboration tool that's not the only

576
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,289
way you should collaborate we always

577
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,230
have a repeatable infrastructure set up

578
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:09,330
or see two domains with vSphere setup

579
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,340
where there's all our Cali VMs team

580
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:15,480
server a team share set that team share

581
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,899
up so you can you know add your findings

582
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,100
your data repository all your raw data

583
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:22,428
pretty pretty important because

584
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,289
sometimes the customer will ask for that

585
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:26,850
and some of this should for us is is

586
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:29,100
very again very repeatable we have run

587
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,389
books for every single Erma processes

588
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,059
that we have here from setting up the

589
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,469
team share trying to have a run book for

590
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,440
payload creation because not every

591
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,659
payload work so every customers network

592
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,779
so you have to have a solid repository

593
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,919
of payloads and options to use and of

594
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:51,570
course your domain and set up in your C

595
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:53,700
2 s to 1 this is a little tricky so how

596
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,610
much research do you do for your

597
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,220
customers before you begin some sort of

598
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,769
threat emulation and do you tailor your

599
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,799
threats to meet the threats that are

600
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:07,880
applicable to that do that team or to

601
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,870
that agency because the threats that are

602
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,640
going against the finance sector

603
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,489
as much are much different than the ones

604
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,510
going against say I don't know the

605
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:21,040
chemical sector so can you tailor those

606
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,990
threats by you you know reading those

607
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,420
sweat Intel reports understanding what

608
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,910
those TTP's are the type of malware they

609
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,580
used that can help if you want to take

610
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,140
it that far you can it's a little tricky

611
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,270
because how realistic is it for you to

612
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,270
read some sort of comprehensive malware

613
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,070
report or threat Intel report and

614
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,010
replicate that very thing in your domain

615
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,060
or in your on your team we can try at

616
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,020
least have an understanding of what

617
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,850
those threats are so they can be

618
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,920
tailored accordingly and we have a lot

619
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,810
of different kind of three word catch

620
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,780
phrases I could have evolved and adapt

621
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,879
don't just accept the status quo always

622
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,670
change always be willing to kind of

623
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,840
enhance what you're doing that's what's

624
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,760
one thing that's allowed us to be

625
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,189
successful over the years and keep that

626
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,600
in mind that status quo piece there I

627
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,220
want to come back to it and one other

628
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,350
thing that we do that is of tremendous

629
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:16,240
value as we map all of our findings - am

630
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:19,780
I gonna get that oh here is no what

631
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,050
happened there okay we map everything to

632
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,580
different frameworks just 853 so the

633
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,909
findings map specifically there so the

634
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,439
customer knows how that works might our

635
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,300
attack I think there might be a talk on

636
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,200
that this week but we just started doing

637
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,300
that people can look and go holy smokes

638
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,960
hacker can do that so that that's the

639
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:44,260
something else you can consider and then

640
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,060
also the cybersecurity framework so keep

641
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,430
that in consideration we have our report

642
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,050
templates and all this they were more

643
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,990
than happy to share just reach out and

644
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:57,550
we can collaborate a little bit more

645
00:23:52,990 --> 00:24:00,870
moving forward um one thing that go back

646
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:03,879
on here I preach to the teams as far as

647
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:06,610
not accepting the status quo making your

648
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,110
TTP's adaptable instead of having that

649
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,600
kind of that cookie cutter SOP what you

650
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,120
do with each engagement and what I've

651
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,179
always kind of preached is use the tenth

652
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,580
man rule anybody see World War Z with

653
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,280
Brad Pitt probably remember the tenth

654
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,780
man rule in that you know in the movie

655
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,920
one of the Mossad agents is explaining

656
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,629
to Brad Pitt why Israel

657
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,670
was so prepared for the zombie

658
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,380
apocalypse answer was simple it's a

659
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,450
tense manual the Israel Security Council

660
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,730
had 10 people on it and the first nine

661
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,810
rejected the idea that there was a there

662
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,580
was going to be an issue with the

663
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,010
zombies we don't need to have problem

664
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,740
the 10th mineral states explicitly that

665
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,200
that tenth man has to overrule the other

666
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,000
nine thereby preparing for a Black Swan

667
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,740
event Black Swan event something you're

668
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,030
not prepared for it so that tenth man

669
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,040
overruled them that way they built the

670
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,990
wall kept their zombies out for a while

671
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,899
that's an extreme example

672
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,250
my point is challenging the other

673
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,540
challenge your team challenge or

674
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,670
checkmate challenge your vendors

675
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,840
challenge your customers don't just

676
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,730
accept what it is and their and the

677
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,730
reason I bring this up is look this is

678
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,930
just an example of the Seavey's I don't

679
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,230
know when this is from maybe last year

680
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:14,510
all based on severity they do a great

681
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,830
job minor does a great job our team does

682
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,330
a great job working with them we have we

683
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,790
have a huge group of people that worked

684
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,460
very closely with with the CVS and with

685
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:25,070
the vulnerabilities but can can we fully

686
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,900
trust this absolutely but how many

687
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,000
vulnerabilities are we not seeing that

688
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,470
have not yet been assigned a CV I don't

689
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,350
know I have nothing definitive to

690
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,060
support that but I'd be willing to bet

691
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,189
that if if there's a vendor out there or

692
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,470
a component that has X number of issues

693
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,670
X number of vulnerabilities there's

694
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,680
probably a bunch that we haven't yet

695
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,850
identified what do they say for every

696
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,530
thousand lines of code there's 30 bugs

697
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,149
now not every one of those bugs is a

698
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,040
security issue I think maybe two or

699
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,370
three are security and not every one of

700
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,280
those are exploitable but do the math

701
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,290
how many lines of code in Windows 10 50

702
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,050
million or something there's a lot of

703
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,990
potential bugs and vulnerabilities that

704
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:08,330
we haven't yet identified so do your

705
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,860
research work with your vendors and take

706
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,080
it a step further and don't just accept

707
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,780
this on something as gospel or resist

708
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,370
the urge to stop once you've obtained

709
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,379
your goal maybe you've access that and

710
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,939
that that critical asset it's gonna be

711
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,590
easy if you figure okay we're done let's

712
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,940
stop resist that urge keep going see how

713
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,209
much farther you can take it it's only

714
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,680
gonna help on 301 we kind of talked

715
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,350
about a little bit this may be

716
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,780
automation is that the future I think so

717
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,219
I think there's an option for for a lot

718
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,570
of this to be automated I don't know it

719
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,510
will be fully automated there's a lot of

720
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,020
people that believe that robotics are

721
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,460
going to kind of take

722
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,629
this over and there are some thread

723
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,880
emulation tools out there that I'll

724
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,700
share with you later on and a big thing

725
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,040
you know transparency and if one of our

726
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,620
customers wants to sit in our lab or

727
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,690
alongside of us sit down learn we want

728
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,050
to help we want the community to be

729
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:02,810
safer and more secure we talked about

730
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:04,129
the kind of modeling your engagements to

731
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,659
a specific customer if you can do that

732
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:09,050
it's gonna it you're gonna take the next

733
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,490
step as far as what methodology goes we

734
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,889
saw this yesterday a cyclical process

735
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,650
there's a bunch of these out there go

736
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,730
online in google hacker methodology

737
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,320
you'll see probably twenty thirty of

738
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,380
them all of them different but all of

739
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,580
them very identical ours is pretty

740
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,470
simple pretty straightforward recon

741
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:31,580
exploitation escalation persistence post

742
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,620
excellent post exploitation now how I

743
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,379
mentioned this before how a red teamer

744
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,909
conducts recon how a pen tests or

745
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,260
conduction week on are two totally

746
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,290
different things so I kind of colored

747
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:45,170
him in there differently we're not using

748
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,970
OSINT anymore it so since I've ever been

749
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,800
told and advised not to use the word

750
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,150
intelligence I told you before that

751
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,800
we're not an intelligence agency we're

752
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,780
not gathering intelligence we're just

753
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,580
gathering information so that that

754
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,710
open-source information gathering piece

755
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,850
is either passive or recon so a pen

756
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,100
tester is going to do it very very

757
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,709
actively they're gonna scan I'm gonna

758
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,850
let the sock know that they're that

759
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,070
they're there they're doing their port

760
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,350
scans and they're volun scans the the

761
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,810
red team is not they're not going to do

762
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,649
any kind of loud enumeration

763
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:16,220
everything's gonna be passive and

764
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,980
offline this is fun part so our pen test

765
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,510
team it's just a matter of finding email

766
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,970
addresses we use a tool called simply

767
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,800
mail it's free it's fun quick and easy

768
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:29,450
there's a bunch of mouths their recon

769
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,350
energy is another good one multigo a lot

770
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,640
of stuff there there's more threat

771
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,250
modeling but I think you can leverage it

772
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,360
if you so chose it's a lot of options

773
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:40,570
there as far as passive goes you know

774
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,469
going through and you know seeing what

775
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,570
kind of profiles are out there on

776
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,640
LinkedIn I saw a LinkedIn profile from a

777
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,010
target once identifying how exactly what

778
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,990
I work for company X and I oversee a

779
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,030
three thousand host network of Windows

780
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,270
seven

781
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:58,860
host done now I don't have to I've

782
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,860
already finger prefigure printed for me

783
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,770
something else I think I brought up on

784
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,820
another slide when you when you do your

785
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,280
fishing you know what's a wealth of

786
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,649
information or out of office replies hey

787
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,930
I'm out of office for the next two weeks

788
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,910
at a conference please contact Bill and

789
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,460
Mary perfect

790
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:18,330
let's find Bill in there and get them

791
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:22,120
now we are restricted a little bit

792
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:24,429
legally if you're not doing your

793
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,530
adversary emulation without some sort of

794
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,090
comprehensive rules of engagement you

795
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:32,020
probably want to consider doing that so

796
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,250
we are limited can't create personas any

797
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,440
red teamers are can you create personas

798
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,710
that's something you can do don't see

799
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,530
anybody we'd love to but persona persona

800
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,850
creation that's serious adversary

801
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,370
emulation if you can do that but we

802
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,320
can't that persona creation sometimes

803
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,729
they'll spend years creating persona and

804
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,250
they'll spend another couple years

805
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,110
creating a persona behind the persona so

806
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:57,250
that can go pretty far we can't do that

807
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:59,979
um we can't use customer names or we

808
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:03,010
can't say hey we're DOJ and put the DOJ

809
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,330
m1 or put it in our c2 domain so we we

810
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,330
are limited with what we can do legally

811
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:13,830
yeah the person nation is the thing so

812
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:17,460
initial targets developed off of the

813
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:20,139
recon that you gather in this face

814
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,880
exploitation what's the number one

815
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,720
attack factor it's gonna be fishing I

816
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,820
think they said ninety-seven percent of

817
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,530
the hacks are responsible do the fishing

818
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,050
the other three percent externally

819
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,950
facing it's still a problem I'm gonna

820
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,250
give you some examples of what our

821
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,780
phishing messages look like and I don't

822
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,460
think you'll be impressed because it's

823
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,070
contest was the sophistication we don't

824
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:46,150
have to try that hard maybe you'll find

825
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:47,439
it impressive so that the typically the

826
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,260
non if you're on the red team the

827
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,770
non-technical personnel are desired

828
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:56,680
because they're not gonna really dig in

829
00:30:52,770 --> 00:31:00,010
to the headers to see if it's suspicious

830
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,530
so they'll focus on that pentest it's

831
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,960
everybody we just vomit out a whole

832
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,270
bunch of fish phishing messages and see

833
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,059
who clicks

834
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:14,500
quick stat so we track everything from

835
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:17,800
the time that we hit Send on a phishing

836
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,250
message to the time it's executed on

837
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,870
average is about 25 30 minutes sometimes

838
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,150
it's instant sometimes it's about 30

839
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,590
minutes so we'll say 30 minutes by

840
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,440
weight of comparison the amount of time

841
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,270
that it takes for somebody at the agency

842
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,880
to notify their sock before they block

843
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:35,650
it is the better part of two hours by

844
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,920
then already established a foothold and

845
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:41,710
improbably escalated so it's still a

846
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,090
problem that needs to be addressed and

847
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,010
that's exactly what we can show them

848
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,449
look you guys took three hours to do

849
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,250
this you need to tweak your I should

850
00:31:46,450 --> 00:32:00,100
need we would advise you to tweak your I

851
00:31:48,250 --> 00:32:06,940
our program question what are success

852
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:11,919
stories oh yes yeah I mean it's pushing

853
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:14,080
100 it's up there I mean every now and

854
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,650
then we'll come across a customer if

855
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,689
it's a small group of 510 working on the

856
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:23,170
same floor with each other that's not

857
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,250
going to work but we don't usually those

858
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,670
aren't the kind of customers we go after

859
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:28,870
if it's more than two three hundred or

860
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,750
more than one hundred we usually have

861
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:34,469
success

862
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,470
there's our another question yeah

863
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:45,159
government agencies anybody gov federal

864
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,160
local state territorial tribal

865
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,590
pretty much yeah open source stuff it's

866
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,630
all out there yep yep we're to like

867
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,889
gnostic Kent and do not endorse one

868
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,270
single tool but we have our favorites

869
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,270
probably figure out what those are

870
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:16,680
we're not dropping this yeah we're not

871
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:22,469
dropping this hero day for the most part

872
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:23,910
yeah yeah it doesn't take a lot one of

873
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,559
our most successful campaigns anybody

874
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:30,030
remember the Ashley Madison breach from

875
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:33,960
while back who was on that I was on it

876
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:36,450
got divorced I'm kidding that's one

877
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,910
mistake I didn't make I think we use

878
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,350
that as a lure once I don't remember the

879
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,200
numbers I'm just gonna use some

880
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:47,550
arbitrary number and make 800 people we

881
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,070
targeted 799 clicked might have been

882
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,320
that high but I'd click that I'll risk a

883
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,600
ping executing I want to see who who at

884
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,830
my office was on that yeah so those are

885
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,110
kind of that's all the kind of research

886
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:01,490
we'll do all right we're going against

887
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:04,409
the local local agency a state

888
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,780
organization we'll see if there's any

889
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,530
kind of controversy that's happening in

890
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,550
the news against that particular entity

891
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,550
but sometimes I think I've got some

892
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,090
examples here yeah this is a very low

893
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,350
sophisticated example of of an older

894
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,770
phishing message that worked would you

895
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:24,540
click on this yeah well we this is what

896
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,949
we do for a living so probably not but I

897
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,570
bet some of your users would I bet you

898
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:30,569
ten years ago you would have I would

899
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,750
have I want to see who got fired but

900
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,820
that you know sophistication wise for us

901
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:42,600
that's pretty obvious right another one

902
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:46,350
o self in uses this kind of strikes a

903
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,879
chord everybody has a cell phone we have

904
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,219
a new policy so I want to see what that

905
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,770
is

906
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:54,779
again sophistication wise

907
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,940
but people still fall for it another one

908
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,780
this one is I'd say kind of ramping up

909
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,780
the sophistication

910
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,319
we see you're doing some unauthorized

911
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,350
activity for your on your workstation

912
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,340
that's gonna freak people out if you

913
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,270
like they've done something that they

914
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,270
shouldn't have but maybe they have

915
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,160
they're gonna see what what needs to

916
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,480
take place and Jason talked about this

917
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,670
yesterday how and this is this is pen

918
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,860
test stuff the red team does this much

919
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,550
much differently they're going to

920
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:25,280
establish a relationship back and forth

921
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:27,820
with usually one maybe two people so

922
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,820
they're taking their time

923
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:34,370
okay the persistence piece affected I'm

924
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:37,580
this Oh Oh expletive another thing I

925
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:39,799
want to bring up it's rare that we

926
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,230
actually have to throw an exploit at

927
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,910
something because usually it's a user

928
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,980
error or misconfigurations

929
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,750
the pen test team might because they

930
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:52,490
have a limited time so they may they may

931
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,930
use Metasploit against eternal blue and

932
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,479
that's kind of unfair for some of our

933
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:59,060
customers some of it massively

934
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,850
appallingly vast networks 100,000 large

935
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,220
and they could be 99.5% compliant with

936
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,450
their patching and still have 500

937
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,680
systems hanging out there with you turn

938
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,640
o blue just waiting to be ha popped so

939
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,640
it's unfair but it is what it is

940
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:23,520
okay the persistence piece

941
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:25,770
most of our on the pen test payloads run

942
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,630
to memory which is perfect because it's

943
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:31,860
it's not going to get detected on any

944
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:36,810
kind of endpoint disk security downside

945
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:38,370
to that of course host is rebooted that

946
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,380
payloads gonna go away so sometimes we

947
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:44,069
have to install a persistence it's rare

948
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:47,100
that we have to but that persistence

949
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,450
does enable us to to remain throughout

950
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,069
the reboots just have to be careful I

951
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,259
thought at the bottom there just to show

952
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,540
you that's cobalt strike that's just an

953
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,460
example of how persistence is installed

954
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:00,090
pretty forward pretty straightforward

955
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,730
install for assistance anybody using

956
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,040
coal Bob strike in here besides us a

957
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:08,790
couple handful yeah it's good tool any

958
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:12,480
other emulation pieces op software out

959
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:15,779
there that you use it's effective you

960
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,230
want to share yeah okay so we can always

961
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,790
remove that and add it as required

962
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,980
hopefully we wouldn't have to rely on

963
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,779
that is we don't want to and the issue

964
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,190
this is where logging comes in if you're

965
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,680
not logging effectively and you leave

966
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,810
your payload that's not gonna look good

967
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,910
so keep that in mind the escalation

968
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,220
piece pretty straightforward again if

969
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,600
you're not if if you have to escalate do

970
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,279
you shouldn't have to if your pen

971
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,950
testing and maybe you don't have to if

972
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,300
your red team just define how you're

973
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,460
gonna do it ensure that you're doing it

974
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,020
and that you're executing with integrity

975
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,650
that's a new three order that we're

976
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,480
using execute with integrity but it just

977
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,880
keeps them running out of time so the

978
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,650
post exploitation piece everything can

979
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,180
kind of start over we can gain access to

980
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,940
those SPS as the sensitive business

981
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,790
systems continue to do your profess can

982
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,390
your recon as needed depending on what

983
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,100
your goals are

984
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,890
again resisting the urge to stop if

985
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:11,040
you've gained access to your if you've

986
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,950
obtained your object objective quick

987
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,720
attack path demo

988
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:18,509
fishing comes in sometimes we'll do a

989
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,149
quick local hash dump crack the

990
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,560
passwords offline at that point you

991
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,260
pivot to other users through lateral

992
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,660
movements what's a good tool for that

993
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,900
blood count is awesome that helps you a

994
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,629
graphical representation

995
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:34,180
representation of Active Directory if

996
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:37,230
you're not using that do whether you're

997
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:40,200
on the offensive side or defensive side

998
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:42,970
so using using the tool like bloodhound

999
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,029
we'll look for users with elevated

1000
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,410
permissions such as an admin well Eskil

1001
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,300
if they escalate those privileges and

1002
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,270
then move over to some of the critical

1003
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,150
assets at that point sky's the limit

1004
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:58,830
pretty much game over and we'll test

1005
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:02,380
their data loss prevention capabilities

1006
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:04,890
by exfiltrating some sort of mock PII

1007
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:07,330
there's a tool called egress assess

1008
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:09,250
it'll create mock PII with a credit card

1009
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,110
and social security numbers you can spit

1010
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:16,150
that out over a variety of protocol

1011
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:16,510
channels FTP HTTP HTTP SMTP and a few

1012
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,360
others

1013
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,990
I just realized when we did this that

1014
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,130
I'm pretty sure that's a floppy disk

1015
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:30,370
like I think that's the old floppy

1016
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:32,560
that's good or that one right now

1017
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:37,509
younger members of the audience is what

1018
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,160
is floppy disk all right so one other

1019
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,730
piece that should be clearly defined

1020
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,290
repeatable and consistent are your are

1021
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,680
your SOPs all your methodologies the

1022
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:51,490
planning phase everything we do has a

1023
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,370
specific set of standards specific set

1024
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:57,339
of steps so if you if you're looking for

1025
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:59,710
that create it to find it write it out

1026
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,050
we'll be happy to share that goes

1027
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,550
something from from your ro e have to

1028
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:07,210
follow that are we go out of scope

1029
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:11,230
that's not good it couldn't confirm

1030
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:14,320
everything some of its obvious the

1031
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:17,080
execution phase also obvious commence

1032
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:21,760
assessment and assessment and everything

1033
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:23,529
in between but are you doing what you

1034
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,720
should be in between and that includes

1035
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,210
remaining in scope tracking all your

1036
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,390
payloads tracking the persistence and

1037
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:34,930
then the post education validation

1038
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,490
analysis confirming that that the

1039
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:40,569
findings that you have obtained are

1040
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:42,700
actually true sometimes we'll feel like

1041
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,450
we gained access to a critical asset

1042
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:49,020
Winn turns out that's a development box

1043
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:59,649
kinda have to start over so important to

1044
00:40:49,020 --> 00:41:01,960
note that okay ata we're gonna run into

1045
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,460
a bunch of defensive tools out there

1046
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,200
that are gonna really make life

1047
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,500
difficult for us one of them's ata it

1048
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,149
could be a teepee crotch Ike has a tool

1049
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:15,550
called carbon black picker tool

1050
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,670
bypassing this and in some capacity or

1051
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:21,070
evading it is it as an important piece

1052
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:22,930
to your engagement some of these tools

1053
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,370
they're it's like anything else you can

1054
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,509
spend all the money on a tool and if

1055
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,560
it's not being if it's not tuned

1056
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,740
properly you know how the right staff

1057
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,180
behind it's not gonna make a difference

1058
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,709
so the point here is if we do run into

1059
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,279
that and have the time like the red team

1060
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:38,140
will pull that tool down install it in a

1061
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,510
lab and figure out what the baseline is

1062
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:43,390
and understand how we can kind of

1063
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:47,230
potentially circumvent it there's just

1064
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:49,660
an example of a PTH it used to be you

1065
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,130
can do pass the hash all day long can't

1066
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,839
do that as much anymore easily

1067
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,430
detectable find a way to circumvent that

1068
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,390
sometimes it requires a lot of

1069
00:41:54,430 --> 00:42:00,190
sophistication other times not so much

1070
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:03,700
here's just an example of maybe one host

1071
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,110
it's doing some activity on something

1072
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,060
you haven't before you got to be careful

1073
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,440
there's ways to circumvent that that are

1074
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,590
beyond the scope of this presentation

1075
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,240
but we can talk about that after so

1076
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:15,400
other modifications and sensitive groups

1077
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,930
this is probably to get you busted but

1078
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,930
there are ways again to circumvent this

1079
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:25,030
there's KSA's one thing that to point

1080
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,800
out is for your adversary emulation

1081
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,960
ensuring that you have those kind of

1082
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,840
those set standards for a path for each

1083
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,950
of your operators from your apprentice

1084
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,990
to your journeyman all the way up to

1085
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,700
your master so everybody knows what they

1086
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,350
need to do to get to the next level so

1087
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,080
you want to be successful everybody on

1088
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,920
the team has to advance their skills

1089
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,759
that's something on which can you rely

1090
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,750
very heavily just another example

1091
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,160
technical administrator not even that

1092
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,590
technical no not administrative

1093
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,830
technical

1094
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:55,820
for every different category and that

1095
00:42:52,830 --> 00:43:16,980
concludes this presentation questions

1096
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:19,530
yes no I will so first answer yes our IP

1097
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,480
has been out there for years and people

1098
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,220
know it they'll submit it to virustotal

1099
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,440
and see that's us and do a quick who is

1100
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,629
and see it's DHS pentesting teams no

1101
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,110
because they know it's us so we're on

1102
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:37,620
the same side just the red team no they

1103
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:46,490
come from the cloud now so no no not

1104
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:46,490
anymore maybe before never right indeed

1105
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,090
for what for purple teaming I mean

1106
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,560
eventually at some point I think we'll

1107
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,140
try to get there as we grow we are

1108
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,490
growing looking for talent so yeah

1109
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,490
just guys later

1110
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:15,480
we're trying to get into that space the

1111
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:17,280
ICS organizations are more apt to use

1112
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,140
our validated architecture design review

1113
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,250
they get very very skittish about us

1114
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,680
touching their systems and

1115
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:26,670
understandably so but we're working very

1116
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,410
actively to get into that space yeah but

1117
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,590
we have we have don't Miran we just did

1118
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:34,140
a PowerPoint last year they gave us I

1119
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,250
think eight hours to get into that power

1120
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,410
plan or might've been in water treatment

1121
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:41,480
I forget and we were able to do so so

1122
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:41,480
yeah sir

1123
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:59,348
technically the barriers are minimal the

1124
00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:01,538
biggest challenge we have is our

1125
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:02,319
customers giving us what we need to be

1126
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:05,140
successful

1127
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,490
they might scoop us out because we can

1128
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,020
only follow what we can only interact

1129
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:12,430
with what's in the scope and they might

1130
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:14,200
just give us 1/24 and that's that's just

1131
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:17,348
not enough and they're resistant to

1132
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,250
letting us get the whole scope because

1133
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:19,599
they're afraid they're gonna lose our

1134
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,770
jobs are afraid they're gonna we're

1135
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,960
gonna air out their dirty laundry which

1136
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,520
we don't do important point to make all

1137
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,829
the data we collect stays between us and

1138
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,549
the customers so that's the biggest

1139
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:32,619
barrier technically you know

1140
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:34,329
occasionally we will hit a snag that

1141
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:36,579
prevents us from doing what we need to

1142
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:37,960
do maybe it's port security maybe maybe

1143
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:39,430
they firewall us off or you know what

1144
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,049
that deal don't feel and us off they'll

1145
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:42,160
give us hey here's a here's a great VLAN

1146
00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:44,288
but there's nothing in it we can't get

1147
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,910
to anything else so we have to work with

1148
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:48,309
the PSC if you want value of a scale

1149
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,460
that's in so that's what we're running

1150
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:50,460
to

1151
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,540
no no we you know our reports are very

1152
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:17,890
comprehensive it defines the attack path

1153
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,110
all the findings all the recommendations

1154
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,240
at that point it's up to them we do a

1155
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:24,190
follow-up in six months to ask them what

1156
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,930
they've what what about which one of the

1157
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,220
recommendations they've implemented that

1158
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:30,310
way we can track that and say you know

1159
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,980
across the sector's X number of sectors

1160
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:34,660
that these number of vulnerabilities and

1161
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,950
issues have been mitigated over time but

1162
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,740
we don't have a policy that says you

1163
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:40,509
have to do that we do when I say we the

1164
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:42,069
government does have a policy for

1165
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:44,280
externally facing vulnerabilities

1166
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,360
they're abiding operational directive

1167
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,670
those criticals have to be mitigated

1168
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,590
within 15 days the highs within 30 and

1169
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,510
then we're driving that if we feel

1170
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:55,000
there's a need for another binding

1171
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,650
operational directive from DHS that

1172
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,990
tells the government that you have to do

1173
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:01,119
this this or this well maybe that's

1174
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:03,040
that's an option in the future we'd love

1175
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,980
to do that and think we're something

1176
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,240
towards which we're driving is in the

1177
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,670
government you know what's what are some

1178
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,229
of the common teams you see oh he's

1179
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,760
gotta have an engineering team you got a

1180
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,990
sock but how many government

1181
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,540
organizations have a dedicated

1182
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,890
penetration testing team not many so

1183
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,660
maybe there's a bad someday that says

1184
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:22,089
hey you got to have a you got a pen

1185
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:27,450
testing hopefully that's the future I

1186
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:27,450
think it's necessary sir

1187
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:42,099
not so much no oh are we red teaming

1188
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:43,899
FedRAMP providers no we won't turn

1189
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,920
anything down if it's gonna help it's

1190
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,109
gonna help the government it's gonna

1191
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,880
help the mission 100% we'll do one can

1192
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:50,259
as we grow I think I think those

1193
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,510
opportunities will present themselves

1194
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,040
absolutely yeah

1195
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,270
the red team's the red team engagements

1196
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,770
are limited you may have resources like

1197
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:59,680
a resource issues like everybody else

1198
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:01,480
but can only we can only go so far the

1199
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,348
queue is big our customer list our

1200
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,790
waiting list is significant not for sy

1201
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:10,180
high but for our pen test and the red

1202
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:13,920
team I mean it's it's up there so the

1203
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,919
more resources we get the more we can do

1204
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,550
if there's nothing else that will

1205
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,280
conclude presentation thank you for

1206
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:25,859
everything

1207
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,859
[Applause]
