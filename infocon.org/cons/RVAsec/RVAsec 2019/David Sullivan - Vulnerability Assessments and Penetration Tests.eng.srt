1
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:33,590
hello there so today we're going to be

2
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,839
talking about a number of things we're

3
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,550
gonna be waiting through some of the

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,850
marketing garbage out there talking

5
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,010
about automated pine testing which is a

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,010
newer term that's come up but we're also

7
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,909
going to talk about vulnerability

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,019
assessments vulnerability scanning

9
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:52,220
versus what actual gun testing is so

10
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:53,870
we'll even touch on how those two

11
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,790
different things can coexist peacefully

12
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,669
in the same environment but how they are

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,320
not the same thing so these aren't the

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,939
scans you're looking for is the name of

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
the talk and there are going to be a lot

16
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:09,770
of Star Wars references as you can see

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:13,729
so alright that's enough you're walking

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:16,490
the carpet so my name is David Sullivan

19
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,350
I'm a pen tester offensive security

20
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:23,119
services at campus guard

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:25,820
we're qsa ASB all that other stuff we do

22
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,369
PCI compliance ongoing support web that

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,169
kind of testing and officiating remote

24
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:31,640
on-site all that kind of stuff I've

25
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,979
worked for a few different government

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,509
agencies here in Richmond as well as a

27
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:40,130
couple other private organizations but

28
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,399
something I just wanted to throw in here

29
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,609
I am a high school dropout who worked in

30
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,229
construction before coming over to

31
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:50,449
technology so the only reason I threw

32
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,859
that in there is because not everyone

33
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,400
comes into security through the same

34
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,350
path it doesn't matter where

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,110
right now if you're a hiring manager

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,369
don't look at someone's past and really

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,780
try to view them for their potential

38
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,580
because people can come from anywhere so

39
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,770
finally my Twitter account there ACTA

40
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,800
bias InfoSec I also love Arrested

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,540
Development not just start worsen and

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,560
there will be some Arrested Development

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,560
references in here too today

44
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,130
yes is that better

45
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,150
alright cool so we're gonna start off

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,430
with these two main terms that we're

47
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,180
gonna talk about vulnerability

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,070
assessments and penetration testing what

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,930
we'll get into there there's a little

50
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,459
more nuance to these definitions but the

51
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,140
first thing we're going to talk about is

52
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,270
vulnerability assessments typically

53
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,700
they're you're talking about scanning

54
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,430
for vulnerabilities checking powders

55
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,720
versions maybe some surface level

56
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,170
exploitation but that's usually

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,650
automated notes and false positives and

58
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,359
the entire process really is automated

59
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,370
and then one we're talking about

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,269
penetration testing they were looking

61
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,180
for vulnerabilities and

62
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,100
misconfigurations again but we attempt

63
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,080
to verify those findings by exploiting

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,460
that and

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,050
those exploits and going to step deeper

66
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,720
and so this may include some

67
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,230
vulnerability scanning but it's really a

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,960
manual driven test that is verified by

69
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,190
automated that includes some automated

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,690
testing so some similarity between terms

71
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,700
but as we go through I think you'll be

72
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,390
able to separate the two different

73
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,859
things a lot more so I just threw this

74
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,529
in here don't take it from me

75
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,890
Tonya jankoji well she works at

76
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:43,220
Microsoft she has a really good write-up

77
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,700
on this VA scans our VA scans and pen

78
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,850
tests not the same thing check out her

79
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,410
blog follow her most of her Andals are

80
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,710
she hacks purple and all the different

81
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,760
accounts she's on so later I'm gonna

82
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,220
have a thing with a bunch of different

83
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,350
people who I recommend fall fling but

84
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,060
she's definitely one in this space that

85
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,590
I think really defines these turns

86
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,300
really well so now we'll get into the

87
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,640
meat and potatoes of it automated pan

88
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,830
testing so if you do a quick Google

89
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,290
search just for the words automated I'm

90
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,989
testing you're gonna come up with all

91
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,089
these different bullets here the first

92
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:23,960
one is a magic pen test for less than

93
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:26,510
$200 with a 24-hour turnaround on

94
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,830
limited scope and a guarantee of zero

95
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,900
false positives another one the power of

96
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,359
a thousand pen testers with a simple

97
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,979
click of a button even I mean you could

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,760
have daily pen test sees in their

99
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,440
service that's how automated it is other

100
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,570
ones use different trademark terms to

101
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,060
describe how they would follow the same

102
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,060
paths that human pen testers follow and

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,520
I think the last one there really was

104
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,290
the funniest to me 7 minutes away from

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,200
knowing if you're secure with our apt

106
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:00,440
apt simulation of your security posture

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,670
so it will only take them seven minutes

108
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,270
to replicate what Russia

109
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:10,200
chyna do and that's all tastes just

110
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:12,419
seven minutes so it's ridiculous right

111
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,950
all these all these companies are

112
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,840
claiming to provide something that can

113
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,560
outperform what the industry does right

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,659
now and it's they're saying you've they

115
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,710
can do a quicker more accurate results

116
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:28,320
and cheaper so I don't know about you

117
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,359
all these claims being bogus to me they

118
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,920
don't really pass the cent test if

119
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,990
anything those are just scans if you get

120
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,820
this Arrested Development reference I'm

121
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:44,520
very proud of you if you don't I'm not

122
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,469
gonna explain it to you but yeah those

123
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,229
companies are all just offering scams

124
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,150
they're just skins some of them may be

125
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,400
good skins they may be better than just

126
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,929
running an SS report or running

127
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,909
something else they may actually reduce

128
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,920
false positives but there's still just

129
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:05,640
scans they're not anything that is new

130
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,320
or far-fetched so why are they calling

131
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,520
them automated contests where did this

132
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,050
even come from well unknown a big part

133
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,859
of the problem is there are a number of

134
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,900
pen testing companies who just do boner

135
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,880
ability skins and they call them pen

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,950
tests John strand I think gives us a

137
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,530
good term he calls them pen test puppy

138
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:32,190
mills so these are just companies that

139
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,679
churn out Nessus Qualis a kinetics all

140
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,930
different kinds of reports they add in

141
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,880
some screenshots put their company logo

142
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:43,020
on it and oops

143
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,969
and they just call that a contest I can

144
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,120
tell you on one recent RFP that we went

145
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,040
over one of the companies bidding asked

146
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,200
if it was okay to simulate attacks for

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,560
the pen test but not actually perform

148
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,760
any expose exploitation but if we go

149
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,060
back and think about what the definition

150
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,590
of a pen test is you exploit

151
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,890
vulnerabilities that's part of the

152
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,260
process so if a company asks you hey we

153
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,370
want

154
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,260
at tests but we're not gonna actually

155
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,100
exploit anything are they offering you a

156
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,500
contest

157
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,500
no they're offering you a vulnerability

158
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,790
skin so if you're on that side the

159
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,470
business side if you're looking to vet a

160
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,690
company they come back with the question

161
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,610
like this just realize in advance you're

162
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,219
getting a vulnerability skin you're not

163
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,790
getting the penetration test so don't

164
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,130
fall for the mind tricks or any hand

165
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:34,690
waving and necess report is not and

166
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,250
never will be a pen test so but just

167
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,110
getting back to that that's the reason

168
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,200
why we're seeing automated pen testing

169
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,640
gain some foothold in this space because

170
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,190
there's other companies doing the same

171
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,419
exact thing but they're lying about what

172
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,890
they're doing and they're charging in

173
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,990
for a pen test but they're just giving

174
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,490
you a vulnerability skin so these

175
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,170
automated pen testers come in they're

176
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,430
upfront about what they're doing they

177
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,660
can tell you we're not gonna actually do

178
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,470
anything we're just gonna run some scans

179
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,810
and call it a pen test so if we want to

180
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,190
make a difference and do things the

181
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,340
right way we're gonna need to draw a

182
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,570
line in the sand between these two terms

183
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,609
and we're gonna have to do things better

184
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,290
if we're on the hiring side we want to

185
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,900
hire consultants that are honest that

186
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,130
actually do contestant and not charge

187
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,260
you for a pen test when they do a

188
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,120
vulnerability scan and if we're on the

189
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,520
technical side and we don't want to do a

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,820
vulnerability scan and tell someone it's

191
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,349
a pen test so the rest of the stock

192
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,540
today is going to kind of touch on both

193
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,370
of those points so from a technical side

194
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,770
we can do things better but also from a

195
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,700
business side how you can tell if who

196
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:40,659
you're hiring is doing a better job than

197
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,970
they claim to be so whoever compares

198
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,530
write that when you're talking to

199
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,870
c-level people you're talking to

200
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,709
management they might not care what you

201
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,720
call it they just want a report that

202
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,000
meets their compliance requirements or

203
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,260
the scans provide some useful insight so

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,410
they don't really care what you call it

205
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,420
they just want the results but

206
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,380
the real question is what is your hand

207
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,229
goal so that can be a little tricky some

208
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,750
organizations just want to be compliant

209
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,150
so they know that they require a yearly

210
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,250
contest so whoever gives them a piece of

211
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,490
paper that says this is a pen test and

212
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,430
you passed they're fine with that

213
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,670
should we be fine with that though one

214
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,319
of the things we run across is that

215
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,110
these kind of pen tests are often scopes

216
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,220
so small that there's not even anything

217
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,560
they're there they're having us look at

218
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,770
this small area for compliance while the

219
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,040
rest of the organization has terrible

220
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,540
vulnerabilities eternal blue other

221
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,650
things but we're not allowed to look at

222
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,290
those they don't want to know about that

223
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,490
they just want to know are we complying

224
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,589
so if that's your goal maybe you don't

225
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,670
care but then that shouldn't be your end

226
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,990
goal you should care more about that

227
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,849
maybe you're looking for some outside

228
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,800
confirmation this will come more if

229
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,480
you're one of the defensive guys or

230
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,380
girls and you're working on the team and

231
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,540
you just want yeah I found these things

232
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,760
we need external confirmation because no

233
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,140
one's listening to me and that can be

234
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,030
frustrating I know a lot of security

235
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,380
internal teams get frustrated with this

236
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,569
we're going to touch on it a little bit

237
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,250
more later but that might be another one

238
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,250
of your goals you might just be looking

239
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,020
for external confirmation and then these

240
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,550
last three points prevent breaches

241
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,220
prevent that for us secure confidential

242
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,930
data these are where a real contest is

243
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,710
going to give you better results than a

244
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:39,449
vulnerability scanner just a plain

245
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:42,370
vulnerability assessment in a good

246
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:45,190
illustration to think of is if you want

247
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,810
it to go get your heart monitored or you

248
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,150
wanted to get your heart health checked

249
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,890
out would you be content with going up

250
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,240
to the pharmacy putting your arm of the

251
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,949
machine and getting a blood pressure

252
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,320
reading or would you rather go to a

253
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,070
cardiologist and get a full workup again

254
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,750
it depends on what

255
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,430
the goal is if you know you have heart

256
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,800
problems you probably need to go see a

257
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,930
cardiologist if you're doing all this

258
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,270
hygiene and stuff already

259
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,650
maybe vulnerability sessoms maybe the

260
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,610
blood pressure machine might be enough

261
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:17,350
to get you by for right now but that's

262
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,550
what we're gonna talk about today so you

263
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,460
really need to know what your goals are

264
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,060
you need to know all the different

265
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,640
threats up there for you so if you want

266
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,890
to get better results as a pen tester or

267
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,270
an organization that's hiring one then

268
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,380
hopefully some of the stuff we talked

269
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,949
about today is going to get you to your

270
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,020
end goal that said obviously not even

271
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,450
the best Security Advisor or fan tester

272
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,210
is going to be able to promise you that

273
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,040
you'll have no breaches but the bad

274
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,500
press won't be there that you can bet on

275
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,569
be completely secure any more than going

276
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,870
to a cardiologist is going to completely

277
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:55,360
secure your heart health you might still

278
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,150
have problems and but you'll be in a

279
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,620
better healthier position if you meet

280
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:08,829
with the right experts on there so what

281
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:11,710
is a real test I like this picture I'm

282
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:16,180
nowhere near the guy on the left I guess

283
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:21,310
the guy on the right I can I can I like

284
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:25,569
that guy but we're just gonna touch back

285
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:27,640
on these things again so this is

286
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,020
important to anyone who's hiring so you

287
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,939
can spot the difference between the two

288
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,890
obviously these two men are very

289
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:39,180
different even though at a quick glance

290
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:42,460
they might have some similarities but

291
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,770
this is where I put too many notes in so

292
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,900
yeah a real fun test it combines

293
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,819
automated and manual testing it's not

294
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,620
just an automatic thing that can never

295
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,310
just be an automated thing that needs

296
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,960
human logic human reasoning to analyze

297
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,760
the results

298
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,629
the second point they're making use of

299
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,519
tools without blindly

300
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,470
that's another big thing especially for

301
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,540
us people on the technical side there

302
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,149
are a lot of tools that come back with a

303
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,819
lot of false positives and they miss

304
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,259
things so we don't want to just run

305
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:16,108
those tools and then just trust them

306
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,089
inherently we want to dig in to what

307
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:21,600
they find and what they don't find and

308
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,339
go even further and that hits on the

309
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,629
next bullet point there where you

310
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,910
compare the different results from the

311
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:28,109
tools look for further attack vectors

312
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,009
see if there's something else that's

313
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:33,929
missing the next bullet point kind of

314
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,970
goes back to the business side of things

315
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:38,819
if you're doing a pen - you want it

316
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,869
scoped for real-world results we talked

317
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,449
about that a little bit with the

318
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:44,489
compliance tests they typically are

319
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:47,248
scoped for real-world results they're

320
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:50,309
scoped for compliance but a good pad

321
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:52,439
test - scoped this is what an attacker

322
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:55,108
sees do it like you don't want to do a

323
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:56,699
pen test where you say okay the mail

324
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:58,829
servers are in scope but you can't touch

325
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:00,479
the DC's because an attacker the first

326
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,729
thing they're gonna do is they're gonna

327
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,089
try to get credentials and if you can't

328
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,859
touch the domain controllers as a pen

329
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,519
tester you can't get those credentials

330
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:12,749
to use against the mail server so

331
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,339
vulnerability scan is probably what you

332
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:17,220
want there because that's gonna tell you

333
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,720
if the mail servers patch but a fully

334
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,939
scoped pen test where you can do all

335
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,439
those different pieces are gonna find

336
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:26,639
out the things that the vulnerability

337
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:30,358
scans miss and the last point there

338
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,529
risk-based findings compliance stuff

339
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:34,139
doesn't always agree with this

340
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,919
compliance findings sometimes require

341
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,720
certain things that that aren't a

342
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:42,149
legitimate high risk or critical risk to

343
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,559
be patched and while those are good

344
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,089
findings there are other things that

345
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,399
they may not require to be patched

346
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:50,249
better technically high in critical

347
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,429
level findings I know when we find all

348
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:56,629
the time is where you can poison the

349
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:56,629
network and listen for

350
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:06,030
relays and collect hashes that's not a

351
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,130
requirement for some compliance things

352
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,870
but that is a very good attack factor

353
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,270
and it usually leads to a lot of

354
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,010
compromise so that's something we put in

355
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,420
our contest reports and it's something

356
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:21,120
that you should be aware of so now comes

357
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:25,079
the part that I'm dreading a little bit

358
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,080
because I did not make a video of this

359
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,760
this is going to be completely live so

360
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,650
we're gonna run a company a couple tools

361
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,439
analyze the results from those tools and

362
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:41,430
then see what we find from a manual test

363
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,020
afterwards so I was told I should have

364
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:51,959
done a video of this just as a backup

365
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:58,410
but I'm also starting to burn up here so

366
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:00,810
I'm gonna take this part off so let me

367
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,520
just start here burn off like Anakin

368
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:12,660
[Laughter]

369
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:13,890
this isn't the fire so yeah so the perp

370
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,870
for the purpose of this demo we're gonna

371
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,580
load up two simple authenticated web

372
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,250
servers something simple you can do with

373
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,220
Python they're gonna run on quartz 80 81

374
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,570
and 80 82 and then the idea here is that

375
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,730
we'll run these tools against the sides

376
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,380
look at the results and then go back and

377
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,380
see if the tools missed anything so

378
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,339
and I thought the two different screens

379
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,300
first only wanted

380
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,850
I don't mean wrong

381
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,730
oh come on

382
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:19,179
and this is why there we go there we go

383
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:24,250
that's on you I just already in oops

384
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:27,600
that should not be I think all right I

385
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,599
can change that

386
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:49,800
I am a fan of nano I don't believe in

387
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:51,390
them and you can see the passwords right

388
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,309
there that will be getting used for the

389
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,309
two different things which is fine

390
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,030
all right so we have both our servers

391
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,889
running and so the first thing we're

392
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,560
gonna do we're gonna go over here and

393
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:15,090
we're gonna run one of our favorite

394
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,330
tools it's made by Chris Sulu who is

395
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:22,490
here that RV a sec he is one of the guys

396
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:26,580
who helps organize it and he actually

397
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,830
convinced me to do this talk and so I

398
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:33,270
wanted to poke at his tool this part of

399
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,850
the talk so we'll let that run real

400
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,620
quick and we're gonna notice some

401
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,620
interesting results from it right away

402
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,540
so you see right here

403
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,570
it found that default admin admin

404
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:52,909
account they found the entry for the

405
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,909
super secret directory and robots.txt

406
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,800
and it also found that some frame

407
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,070
cutters are missing and things like that

408
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,389
and that the simple HTTP also appears to

409
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,280
be outdated so these are all decent

410
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,640
findings these are all good things that

411
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:15,680
you can use as a fantastic a good to let

412
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:20,600
your customers know so we're gonna go

413
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,600
let me make sure I'm doing this right

414
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:30,200
yeah so let's just go to the website now

415
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,770
it's not leaving the main street

416
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,680
let's

417
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:21,510
over that one $27 and up 0.1 80 83 oh

418
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,590
forgot extern for fun

419
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,960
burp suite is also an amazing tool that

420
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,789
we use if you're not a technical person

421
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,269
or if you are a type of person who

422
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:44,960
doesn't use Burks we'd use it it's

423
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:44,960
incredible

424
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,260
during the proxy class

425
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,470
so we know that the password is admin

426
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:19,280
admin from looking at the results from

427
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:22,670
nikto hello and welcome to the test

428
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,170
server we don't really see anything else

429
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,470
on here but we know that there was a

430
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:30,530
directory or there was a robot stop text

431
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:34,310
file you can look at that we see

432
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:37,060
disallow super-secret directory so we'll

433
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,060
take a look at that

434
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:46,799
and there's nothing in there

435
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:51,629
so they found some valid things that

436
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:56,340
didn't get us any farther than this if

437
00:21:51,629 --> 00:22:03,840
we go to 80 84 let's say we try admin

438
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:08,908
admin there that doesn't work so we can

439
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,529
go back same thing here we see in Berk

440
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:13,320
it's found the clear text submission of

441
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:17,629
password it found the robots.txt file

442
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,918
unencrypted communications the spider

443
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,939
it's running now but it's not gonna find

444
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,970
anything else because there wasn't

445
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,559
really anything else there so now we're

446
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,559
on Nick - against our second hose

447
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,390
again it finds the simple HTTP is

448
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:46,059
outdated

449
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:46,059
it's a notable finding but

450
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,889
we know that that's not going to come up

451
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,890
with anything more than

452
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,620
it's the hospital

453
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:08,549
so we'll just like that in your minds

454
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:12,750
and now we'll take a look at another

455
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:14,220
free tool it's not the greatest tool but

456
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,520
for a free tool it's actually not that

457
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,520
bad

458
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:27,380
it's called open VA's which some people

459
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,380
might be familiar with

460
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,230
what

461
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,379
that's not right

462
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,090
alright there might be some kind of

463
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,610
other proxy

464
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,959
well the results from that were the same

465
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,379
as everything else we work that out

466
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,620
anyway here we can see it's not

467
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:01,660
authenticated to 80-84 but let's go back

468
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:03,429
and take a manual look at 80 83 so this

469
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,730
doesn't really seem to show much but if

470
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:09,540
we just do the view page source okay

471
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,540
nothing there

472
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:22,690
oh that was the other thing we want to

473
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:26,850
do it alright one more tool I hope I'm

474
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,850
not doing terrible time probably

475
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:36,430
so another tool we commonly use as derby

476
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,760
Thanks

477
00:24:48,830 --> 00:25:01,010
I don't know what I do with that and

478
00:24:53,630 --> 00:25:12,460
here we'll even put in the credentials

479
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:12,460
that we had found from nikto

480
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,240
and while this is running I'll just note

481
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:24,559
that nikto is also a race of aliens from

482
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:29,510
Star Wars so I don't know if Chris even

483
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:32,809
knows that yeah they are on the sail

484
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:36,620
barge on Jabba's Sail Barge in Return of

485
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:38,269
the Jedi hmm I like Star Wars a little

486
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,479
too much do you know I think you know

487
00:25:38,269 --> 00:26:00,679
where Chris came with the terminal Cobra

488
00:25:40,480 --> 00:26:02,779
army all right so here we found him

489
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,269
another directory that wasn't found by

490
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:11,260
nikto wasn't found by burke z working

491
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:11,260
files i think this is a german directory

492
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:24,470
so let's go to

493
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:25,699
is he working files so beep boop bop

494
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,100
someone make fun of me for that

495
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,159
yesterday we're not doing beep boop beep

496
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,860
but uh so here again it looks like

497
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:38,059
everything's fine again let's view the

498
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:41,719
page source and oh there's a super duper

499
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:47,418
secret of my dream in the code up here

500
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:54,919
that our crawler didn't find so we'll

501
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:57,470
copy that base and go report oh yeah

502
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:03,019
that's ready thank you

503
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:04,330
oh no you found a minute a view page

504
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:08,960
source again

505
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:11,439
and here's another directory are you

506
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,440
kidding me

507
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,479
I think the ports are I just miss that

508
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,908
yeah so now we know this would have been

509
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:35,320
found by a human is the admin password

510
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:35,320
to port 8080 for so now if we go back

511
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,150
and will

512
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,650
this would have been found by a human

513
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:53,610
and all of our files are belonging

514
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:54,660
so vulnerability scanners tools didn't

515
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,919
find any of this stuff we had to

516
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:00,150
actually look at the source code that

517
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,790
something we'll talk about about a

518
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:21,450
little bit more in the next slide which

519
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:25,620
I need to pull back up I probably should

520
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:28,820
have done a video like I was told to we

521
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,820
made it through with help from you guys

522
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,039
keep losing the mouse

523
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:49,330
okay so the question you're probably

524
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,490
asking in your head right now is is this

525
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,830
even realistic when we just did didn't

526
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,110
looking at source code finding

527
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,270
directories that have passwords and

528
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,159
other commented text and the short

529
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,430
answer is yes this is very real and the

530
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,070
long answer is yes this is very real but

531
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,590
it depends so obviously it was a simple

532
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,620
example creds usually aren't this easy

533
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:14,530
to find but they are this easy to find

534
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,560
sometimes developers leave stuff in the

535
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:20,080
code all the time that they shouldn't

536
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,330
we've seen Gmail credentials connection

537
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,340
string info passwords decryption keys

538
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:27,370
all of that stuff and commented code

539
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:32,230
that wasn't picked up on by any scanners

540
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:33,610
or tools even more expensive tools

541
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,070
because obviously these were all free

542
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:38,550
tools that we showed today but we use a

543
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,200
lot of tools that we pay for that are

544
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:44,290
much more thorough and they still miss

545
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,310
stuff the example of finding that a

546
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:49,000
decryption keys was an interesting one

547
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,450
because you had to go to multiple

548
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,510
locations to figure everything out so

549
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,950
there was one part in the commented code

550
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:01,030
that told you where they got their code

551
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:03,760
from for the server-side code so when

552
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:08,440
one on stackoverflow pulled down that

553
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:11,140
see Charcot wrote it up then we found

554
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,420
another part in another commented code

555
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:19,690
that said that the passwords for the

556
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:22,510
decryption were the name of the function

557
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,640
and now we found another list that had

558
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,220
the list of all the names of the

559
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,370
functions so we were able to take the

560
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:33,850
code we found on Stack Overflow put it

561
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:38,229
in get one working user credential plug

562
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:40,060
that and then reverse it and then get

563
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,630
into every single applications multiple

564
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,510
different users because we can done just

565
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,090
correct the user token and use that

566
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,520
against the server so this is real this

567
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:55,850
this stuff happens it's in commented

568
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:58,070
code all of the time so don't rely on

569
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,500
automation the bad guys don't think they

570
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:07,460
might sometimes but the good ones aren't

571
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:08,810
going to so another another thing we

572
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,910
come across is well we passed their

573
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,980
contest we're secure right well it

574
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:17,810
depends now from a certain point of view

575
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:19,880
you might be but again if we're if we're

576
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,580
talking about scoping if you're scoping

577
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,330
things to be unrealistic

578
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,100
you're not secure you're compliant

579
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,110
compliant does not equal secure that's

580
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,060
something that we need to talk about

581
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:36,199
with executives all the time we need to

582
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:39,770
talk about it with even CISOs and iso's

583
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,320
and even people on and the doing the

584
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:46,010
grunt work on the security teams

585
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,270
compliance is not security so you have

586
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,640
to ask these different questions what

587
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:53,110
was the scope what were the targets was

588
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,110
it a scan or a pun test

589
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:04,000
so I'm trying to figure out where I am

590
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:08,560
on my notes so I can give you an example

591
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,140
of another thing we came across that a

592
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,210
scan would have been meaningless because

593
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,370
we were doing a pen test that had a

594
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:19,630
publicly accessible gitlab open to the

595
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:21,520
Internet everything was good on the

596
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,320
outside like the default passwords were

597
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:28,450
changed it was up to the current patches

598
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,610
trying to brute-force accounts that we

599
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:35,740
found for other parts of the network

600
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:37,899
didn't work Yatta Yatta Yatta all that

601
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,930
stuff didn't work but we did find that

602
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,280
we could create a guest account a

603
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,310
vulnerability scanner is not going to

604
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,620
create a guest account so we created a

605
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:51,250
guest account on this get lab logged in

606
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:54,070
and look empty okay but now we started

607
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:59,530
to do some queries and we found the

608
00:32:54,070 --> 00:33:02,980
other users code was shared with anyone

609
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:04,540
who was logged into that get lab so we

610
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,010
then went from there and we got to all

611
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,200
the code for the entire organization

612
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:13,450
which again had hard-coded credentials

613
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:19,030
that had internal PCI related stuff in

614
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:21,910
the code that was just terrible so when

615
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,830
you're hiring a pen testing company or

616
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,030
you're even doing a pen test internally

617
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,810
you want to make sure that you're using

618
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:32,200
reputable people and that kind of goes

619
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:33,909
into our next slide if it sounds good to

620
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,870
the truth too good to be true it

621
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:41,670
probably is right we've said it a

622
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,669
hundred times the scan is not a pen test

623
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,610
some of the other things you want to

624
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,240
avoid are people who just use buzzwords

625
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,428
and don't even

626
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,100
they mean so if someone's saying well

627
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:55,580
our technology we use AI or machine

628
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:58,760
learning pen tests and we do automation

629
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,470
on the blockchain what do they even know

630
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,669
what those words mean a lot of people

631
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:08,330
don't

632
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:10,639
a AI is another word for a cascading

633
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,109
group of questions where it's just a

634
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,310
bunch of yes or no this really it's not

635
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:16,520
AI does not really exist at this point

636
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,279
blockchain

637
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,109
that's a database so great your tool

638
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,290
uses a database so does every other tool

639
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:28,759
you just happen to have your logs public

640
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:30,139
on the blockchain so that's it's

641
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,970
something to watch out for they may

642
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,470
still be good products but don't rely on

643
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,138
someone who just uses blood work

644
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:38,029
buzzwords and don't know what those

645
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:42,589
buzzwords mean or anything else about

646
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:44,480
their product the one that I really like

647
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:46,909
it's actually kind of funny if you do a

648
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,810
Google search for AI pentest you'll come

649
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:54,740
across some pretty interesting claims

650
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:56,629
there was one I don't I didn't put it in

651
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:03,500
here but there was one that claimed that

652
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:06,069
it could do it updated while it was

653
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,359
running that updated new definitions and

654
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,170
that it was the work of a thousand

655
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:13,430
pentesters

656
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:16,160
all of them and that I think it tied in

657
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:18,319
with that 7-minute pen test - we've had

658
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,490
nmap skins first single post take longer

659
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,560
than seven minutes I don't know how

660
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,379
you're gonna do an unlimited scope pen

661
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:27,080
test in seven minutes

662
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:30,580
so another thing that I just put any

663
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:34,930
real quick or trendy security solutions

664
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:37,190
this can be things like crowd-sourced

665
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:40,069
solutions while they have their place

666
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:44,150
bug bounties have their place if you

667
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:45,320
don't know what your vulnerability scans

668
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,940
are if you

669
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,950
done contest you're probably not ready

670
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,290
for bug bounties you're probably not

671
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:53,660
ready for crowdsource solutions if we

672
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:56,750
think back to that cardiologist example

673
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:59,089
a crowdsource solution is like going and

674
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,070
getting an EKG and then posting it on

675
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,740
the internet and looking for people to

676
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,850
tell you what's wrong with you if you

677
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,770
haven't gotten that read by a

678
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,900
cardiologist already you're not gonna

679
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:12,020
know what is good advice and what's bad

680
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,790
advice so you want to watch out for jump

681
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:18,280
into those trendy security solutions

682
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:20,120
without already having the basis time so

683
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,770
there's a lot of different service

684
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,720
offerings a lot of different terms not a

685
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:26,480
Star Wars life this is not a Star Wars

686
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:33,529
slide but I had this song in my head the

687
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:35,240
day that I was reading this so you have

688
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,680
all these different things security

689
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,419
program risk management program

690
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,700
vulnerability assessment spawn testing

691
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,220
fix your fishing exercises Red Team bug

692
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,660
bounty etc where do you start

693
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,980
well you start at the top if you don't

694
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,140
have a basic security program you

695
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,780
shouldn't be doing a bug bounty if you

696
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,190
don't have a vulnerability assessment

697
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,370
program you're not ready for a red team

698
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,440
exercise so this is the general flow

699
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,000
that you want to do things will dig into

700
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,150
four of these terms a little bit more on

701
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,150
the next slide just because I think I'm

702
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,510
running low on time he just said you

703
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:13,370
know okay cool I need to look up more so

704
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:17,170
that's probably a boy so where are we

705
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:19,190
with everything so vulnerability scans

706
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,450
again we're talking from the top down

707
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,690
this is probably about the order you

708
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:25,339
should do things in generally

709
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:28,060
vulnerability scans or anything they

710
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,620
realized solely or mostly on automated

711
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,330
scans anything that claims to be an

712
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:36,440
automated pen test is a vulnerability

713
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:37,880
skin it falls into that bucket anything

714
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,200
that just tests the surface without

715
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,920
going further and exploiting

716
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,660
vulnerabilities

717
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,350
that's a vulnerability scan or a

718
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:47,060
vulnerability assessment and testing is

719
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,660
where manual and automated tests and get

720
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,400
mixed

721
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:53,720
it really focuses on the manual testing

722
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,829
but depending on the needs of what

723
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,990
you're testing the scope is going to

724
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:58,280
change the amount of manual testing and

725
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,770
automated testing is going to change

726
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,170
based on scope and different things but

727
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,759
with a test I think it was brought out

728
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,480
really good in the red team talk if

729
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,819
anyone went to that by Jason a pen test

730
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,920
is trying to find as much as you can in

731
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:15,710
a short time period it's really about

732
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,220
testing the breadth of your security and

733
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:21,020
then going from the depth from there so

734
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,240
when we go to a red team there we're

735
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,069
looking for testing the depth of your

736
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,689
controls so you're not looking for as

737
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,819
many entry points as possible you're

738
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,440
looking for a few entry points and then

739
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:32,779
seeing how deep you can go with those

740
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,579
where a pen test you don't care how loud

741
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,859
you are a red team you're trying to be

742
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,630
quiet you're trying to evade any

743
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:42,410
security protections they have in place

744
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,819
and then a bug bounty that combines all

745
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,740
different things it's typically a

746
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:49,509
crowdsource program that combines

747
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:52,250
multiple different testing methodologies

748
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,900
I'm not knocking on bug bounty programs

749
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,520
at all I'm actually signed up for a few

750
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:01,940
of them myself and have submitted things

751
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:04,279
to Google and Microsoft and Yahoo but

752
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,990
it's it's something that you need to be

753
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:08,270
doing everything else right before you

754
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:12,319
go for a bug bounty it's not something

755
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:13,910
you start with him I think the person

756
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:18,470
who knows the most about this will just

757
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:22,839
read from her is Kate mrs. Kay team oh

758
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:26,180
she gave the keynote here last year on

759
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:27,770
this very thing and she's probably one

760
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,529
of if not the most important people in

761
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:33,140
the bug bounty field she started the bug

762
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:34,560
Ronnie program at Microsoft she did work

763
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,529
for hacker one and now

764
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,090
our own consulting firm so if you think

765
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,240
your organization is ready for something

766
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:43,650
like this or you want to move towards

767
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,330
setting one up look at some of her

768
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:50,370
research on it but you can see from here

769
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:53,130
she says we all had high hopes for the

770
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:54,779
defense market for bugs the hype hasn't

771
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,510
reached the effectiveness is currently

772
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,220
over marketed the business model of bug

773
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,690
bounties is under fire from the bug

774
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,540
bounty companies themselves saying

775
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:06,090
there's not enough money in it and this

776
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,310
is talking about how hacker one found

777
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:12,180
out that 97% of their own researchers

778
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:14,490
have never sold above so when you hire a

779
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,500
crowdsource solution or you go into the

780
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:19,649
bug bounty market you don't know which

781
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,050
testers you're getting there are some

782
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,670
really really good people out there one

783
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:28,350
of them is even here in Richmond who I

784
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:31,020
think is in the top five hacker one but

785
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,759
you don't know if that person is gonna

786
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,170
be working on your organization or if

787
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,050
you're just gonna get people who are

788
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,570
gonna run Nessus not find anything and

789
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,800
then call it a day and those findings

790
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,390
should be getting done it with your

791
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,130
vulnerability assessments anyway so you

792
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,190
shouldn't have those out there for your

793
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,090
bug bounty program so she has a lot of

794
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,730
good of examples

795
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,560
check out her keynote from last year's

796
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,090
RBA second should be up on the website

797
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,009
I'm pretty sure it is I think I've

798
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,110
watched it again she even talked about

799
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,430
the guy who stole the tank last year and

800
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:03,450
drove through Richmond so that was a

801
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:07,379
pretty good talk but Caitlin sir the

802
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:09,740
Souris is just awesome follow her I I

803
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,660
can't add anything to anything she said

804
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,529
so now we get to to that final question

805
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,790
who should be performing your pond tests

806
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:22,530
in general there's a bunch of different

807
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:25,350
viable solutions from a management and a

808
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:30,180
technical standpoint there's advantages

809
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:31,770
and disadvantages but let's talk about

810
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,240
internal assets first well we're talking

811
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,990
about internal assets it's not

812
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,479
necessarily

813
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:38,419
people just on the security team these

814
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,130
are people who are just on your

815
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,590
company's payroll you know maybe they're

816
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,570
on the infrastructure team or they're on

817
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,940
the web team but they have a lot of

818
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,160
technical expertise in that area bring

819
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,170
them on board use them as part of your

820
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,850
internal security program so that way

821
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,400
it's not just one team making all the

822
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,470
decisions it's subject matter experts

823
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,360
from each team being able to be a part

824
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:04,890
of that and add to it and if you get it

825
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,590
if you do have a good internal team

826
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:09,540
that's awesome use them but the biggest

827
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:12,300
issue we see with internal teams is

828
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:17,940
they're not often empowered to actually

829
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:20,580
do the testing one of the places that I

830
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,070
used to work and no one from that place

831
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:30,830
is in here right now so I'm going to say

832
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:35,190
I once I once asked if I could run

833
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:39,119
Wireshark on the guest Network and I was

834
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:40,920
told no that's too dangerous as a

835
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,400
security person I was not allowed to run

836
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,380
Wireshark on a open public network that

837
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,750
our company provided because they felt

838
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,550
that was too dangerous that's not

839
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,950
empowering your internal people that's

840
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:55,619
that's discouraging your internal people

841
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:57,089
and it can cause more problems so that's

842
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:58,050
not the kind of stuff you want to do if

843
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,369
you have a good way to make your

844
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,369
internal people externally

845
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:06,919
so yeah if you want your internal people

846
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:08,779
to leave and then come back as a

847
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,069
consultant and charge you more than you

848
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:12,559
were paying them when they work for you

849
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:21,859
that's a great way to do it don't don't

850
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:26,809
let them find bugs for you so now going

851
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:29,180
there so now we want to talk about other

852
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:31,039
things because there's a lot of

853
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,469
different ways to bypass automated

854
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,029
protections and using internal people

855
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:36,799
they're gonna know what your internal

856
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,599
protections are already it'll be a

857
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:40,969
really good insight into that so use

858
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,119
your internal people as much as you can

859
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:46,190
it's gonna cost you less and it will

860
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,479
give you a really it will empower them

861
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,049
they'll feel better about what they're

862
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:54,229
doing but what if you don't have

863
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:56,329
internal resources that you can use or

864
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:59,509
you need to use an external vendor for

865
00:43:56,329 --> 00:44:01,910
compliance reasons or you just want

866
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:04,160
people who are even more skilled to be

867
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,890
doing this well looking at external

868
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,368
vendors you want to take a look at a

869
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:12,969
number of different things the general

870
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:16,789
rule there is you get what you pay for

871
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:18,829
that other slide that had the bear with

872
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:22,249
the free pen test then you probably know

873
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:26,599
what you're going to get with that but

874
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:29,359
it if you pay for the 200 dollar magic

875
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:32,769
contest you're probably only going to

876
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,959
get about $200 worth the results of that

877
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:40,069
so watch what you're hiring when you

878
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:41,779
look for different vendors on the same

879
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:43,660
token paying Lord doesn't automatically

880
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:48,319
mean you're going to get a better test

881
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:51,589
if we talk about Tanya Jenkins we talked

882
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:56,079
about earlier she has some really great

883
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:56,078
questions that you can ask

884
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,900
where is it so this is her example

885
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,868
question that she asks any vendors

886
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:07,630
coming in pretend I'm a programmer and

887
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:10,300
you found cross-site request forgery in

888
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:12,820
my app explain to me what it is and how

889
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:15,040
to fix it if you're hiring an external

890
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,440
company to do a contest for you and they

891
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,279
can't answer that question they aren't

892
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,330
going to be a good pen tester hoping

893
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,830
some other points you brought out if

894
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,990
they respond by talking over your head

895
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:28,690
trying to say things that don't sound

896
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:31,390
right to you if they talk down to you

897
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,920
trying to make you feel stupid if they

898
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,850
give you an incorrect answer or just

899
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,140
can't explain it

900
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:38,049
these are all signs that you should

901
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,700
probably steer clear that sounded pretty

902
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,760
sound advice when vetting a company

903
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,950
another thing asked for sample reports

904
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,690
if you if they provide a sample report

905
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,839
and it looks like an SS report it

906
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:51,700
probably is an SS report so you know

907
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,000
that they're probably not going beyond

908
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:58,419
those manual tests or the automated

909
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,240
tests so we get to our our final thing

910
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,490
here nothing is impregnable we covered a

911
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,689
lot today but I think we can learn a big

912
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:09,069
lesson from the destruction of the

913
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:10,900
deaths are before the plans fell into

914
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,520
the hands of the Rebel Alliance how many

915
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,640
times do you think the Empire looked

916
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:19,020
over those plans how many yeah how many

917
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,020
times do you think they have skin

918
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:25,660
admiral mati if people remember if

919
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:27,310
anyone gets that reference awesome if

920
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,339
you don't get that reference he was the

921
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:32,380
guy who Vader eventually choked in a new

922
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,790
hope but he was so confident that he

923
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,740
claimed that even though the Alliance

924
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:38,440
had the plans for the station that any

925
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,200
attack against it would be a useless

926
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,500
gesture have you heard those same kind

927
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,730
of arrogant claims from your engineers

928
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:50,650
from your c-level people your sis at

929
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,390
Mynt

930
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:55,900
I can't tell you how many times we've

931
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:58,359
heard it but because the Alliance took a

932
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,430
look at those plans and they had skilled

933
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:03,220
people not just running it through a

934
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:05,799
scan but looking for something specific

935
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:09,359
a specific weakness from an attackers

936
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:11,769
mindset they were able to find that flaw

937
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,328
so a good pen testing company should be

938
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:16,808
able to do the same where scans fail

939
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:18,519
technically skilled attackers prevail

940
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:20,589
don't let your organization be taken

941
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:23,439
down by a single flaw the size of a womp

942
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:25,509
rat don't be content with just doing

943
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,630
automated scans instead use a well

944
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:31,119
vetted technically skilled company or

945
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,319
person or people in your company who

946
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,289
aren't afraid to get their hands a

947
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:37,058
little dirty and do some manual testing

948
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:38,859
so I'm really short on time the

949
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:41,289
takeaways are here the slides gonna be

950
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:42,759
up somewhere I don't know our be a sec

951
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:46,509
we'll provide them if not I'll provide

952
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:48,279
the slides if you want these but we have

953
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:50,019
some takeaways there some additional

954
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:52,960
training resources for anyone who is a

955
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:55,390
technical person burp suite academies

956
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,140
free it's awesome their cross-site

957
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:00,940
request forgery labs are just great a

958
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,239
tester Academy is a good one

959
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:06,489
over the wire black room SEC Tara has

960
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:09,029
compiled a bunch of different things all

961
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:12,489
into one site so that's another good one

962
00:48:09,029 --> 00:48:15,869
and then again just a bunch of accounts

963
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:18,430
to follow these are all Twitter handles

964
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:21,369
all these are great people who know a

965
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:23,359
lot about this and I included my

966
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:33,260
employer in there because

967
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:35,380
I worked for them with that dude is

968
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:42,160
there any questions before we finish yes

969
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:42,160
with defect in the dark Sider it was

970
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:47,000
actually a lot of things with the bug

971
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,890
bounty programs if you looked at some of

972
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,880
Caitlyn sources work as the numbers

973
00:48:48,890 --> 00:49:10,609
crawl for bug bounty programs the the

974
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:16,370
incentive so that is a great question

975
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:18,080
because of lack of time and this being a

976
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,270
101 course purple teaming is a little

977
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,950
more advanced but yet purple teaming is

978
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:25,310
awesome where you have your own internal

979
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,720
Red Team internal blue team and there

980
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,950
they're testing each other and you have

981
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,200
the team that what kind of works both

982
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:34,970
sides of the house you know purple team

983
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:36,910
is great anyone else

984
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:43,738
