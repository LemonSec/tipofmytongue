1
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,199
all right good afternoon everyone let's

2
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,560
find receipts we'll get started

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,640
my name is jeff duhovnick

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,920
and today's presentation is

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,039
infrastructure as code

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,920
all right to kick things off we're gonna

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,960
do a mindful minute

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,880
and for those of you who don't know what

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,600
that is uh basically

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
we're gonna

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
take some deep breaths

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,280
just relax soften your gaze

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,719
for a minute we want to be aware of

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,559
where we are

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,079
and just try to clear our heads to get

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,079
ready

17
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,080
if you have any thoughts

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
flip through your head maybe stresses of

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,400
the day just try to label them

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,119
let them float away

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
about halfway through

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,560
a couple more deep breaths

23
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,960
10 more seconds

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,798
all right

25
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
all right continuing on

26
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,960
uh who am i the whom i slide

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,799
i said jeff the hovenic i work for rec

28
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,799
space government solutions

29
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,439
i'm a senior netsec product engineer

30
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,600
and don't let the term product

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,639
throw you off too much i still do netsec

32
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,679
so

33
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,239
firewalls ids ips that kind of thing

34
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,520
i kind of didn't know what product it

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
was before i took the job so in my

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
interview the boss pretty much

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
said hey you know this is product like

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,560
so i developed new things and i'm not on

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
call he said yeah i said great

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,200
sign me up so

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
i learned a lot about the product

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,360
development process and cycle

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
learned a lot about the business side of

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,480
things

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
in my new role so

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,599
really happy to be there

47
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,040
really happy for my security background

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
that i've gotten along the way

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,640
as you can see

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,080
i like python i've been deep into aws

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,400
and been doing devops

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
i'm not a security connoisseur

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
not so much of a practitioner

54
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,680
not doing the day-to-day operation stuff

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,599
i have a family

56
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,440
i'm an avid hockey fan

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,159
any other hockey fans in the room all

58
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
right

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
and

60
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,799
i'm in enemy territory so i won't say

61
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,440
um but i

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,959
yeah i do

63
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
i grew up in pittsburgh

64
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
so

65
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
i

66
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
i also do woodworking and i am an avid

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,159
reader as well

68
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,799
all right so real quickly uh this is not

69
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,640
a prescriptive presentation i just want

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,239
to get your wheels turning thinking

71
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,120
about things so as i present ideas uh

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
it's not meant to be a

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
a solution but more of a thought or

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
something you could take back and think

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
about

76
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,280
there's a lot of links in this

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
presentation so i encourage everyone to

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,280
download and follow the links

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
and get some ideas get some more

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
reference material to re-up on

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
also this is not a security focused

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
presentation

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,000
so

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
the question is

85
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
why am i here i'm at a security

86
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
conference well i think

87
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
a couple reasons number one i'm among

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
friends i've been to

89
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,159
rva sec

90
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,959
quite a few years now so i know a few

91
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,440
folks in the audience so that's great

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
but also my coding skills are not good

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
enough to be presenting at a developer

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
conference

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,639
but i know amongst hackers the idea is

96
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,960
you know get it to work and you're good

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
so

98
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
i got my code to work so i think i'm

99
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,960
good

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
any developers here

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
all right cool

102
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
you guys can

103
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
probably spot some inefficiencies pretty

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
quickly

105
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,919
all right so to kick things off this is

106
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,360
kind of the roadmap of what we're going

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
to do what we're going to talk about

108
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,639
terms and definitions so we're on the

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,840
same page

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
theory principles and concepts some

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
pseudo code some modeling patterns as

112
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,960
you can see we're going to go a little

113
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560
bit into

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
some developer theory

115
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,880
some developer concepts

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
also i'm going to mention the cloud as i

117
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,639
said i've been working in aws so my

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,360
references are in aws but the theory and

119
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,759
concept should apply to

120
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,280
three major public clouds as well as

121
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,919
private cloud

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,479
all right so the first is you know

123
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,479
why would you do infrastructure as code

124
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,759
and

125
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
you know pretty much there's some

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
obvious things

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,919
um

128
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,560
you save time on deploying

129
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
you

130
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
you have a consistent deployment you

131
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
know all these things are obvious but

132
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,400
really when you look at leveling up

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,919
you look at your dry principles and

134
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,600
stuff it really becomes apparent and

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
we'll see that

136
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
with object-oriented programming how

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
that ties into infrastructure as code

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
making that bridge is

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
really crucial in getting to that next

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,440
level

141
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
all right so some terms and definitions

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,240
infrastructure

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,000
is probably obvious things router

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
switches your infrastructure that makes

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
iot run your database servers your app

146
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
servers your load balancers

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
but also infrastructure in this case

148
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
when you're coding

149
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
you want to think about things like your

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,759
iot

151
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,080
you want to think about things that

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,039
are connected but maybe not managed

153
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,880
so you can apply code

154
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
to those things so it's not just your

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
typical i.t infrastructure but

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
everything

157
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
infrastructure is code is management

158
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
code

159
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
then some programming concepts

160
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
object-oriented programming

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
i used to hate this concept because i

162
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,120
didn't understand it but once i started

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
understanding it and using it i really

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,319
started liking it because it made my

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,400
testing quicker and easier i mean my

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
development a lot faster

167
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
it just made my flow so much better and

168
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,120
it got rid of my

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
ugly scripts

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
that i was creating

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
all right so what's the big idea

172
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
we went through some obvious

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
advantages but

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
bringing that down to a business case

175
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,039
we've talked about saving time

176
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,800
increased and easier security so there's

177
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
our security mention

178
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,639
there's a talk tomorrow at one o'clock

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,440
on security with infrastructure as code

180
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,680
so good follow-up talk to

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,240
today's presentation

182
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,199
also compliance with uh your code repo

183
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,680
and version control any auditors in the

184
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
house

185
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
all right so what do you guys think

186
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,639
infrastructure is code if all your

187
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,479
infrastructure was in code

188
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,000
you'd be pretty happy you'd be able to

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
see everything right there what's

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
deployed how is it deployed what's the

191
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
configurations you don't have to go out

192
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,360
to every device

193
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,759
and look i can just check my code i can

194
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,120
see the version control in history

195
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
so who changed what and why is real big

196
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,400
with code versioning repos

197
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,879
that becomes readily apparent

198
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,840
some other not so obvious

199
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,919
benefits code is documentation

200
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,080
so if you've ever written documentation

201
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,080
you got to be a real special person to

202
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,599
write to really like doing that i know

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,319
there's tech writers that enjoy that but

204
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,720
me i'd rather code things and i think

205
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
most folks here in the audience are more

206
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
of that you know development type person

207
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,199
so instead of writing your code separate

208
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,879
why don't you just keep it all at once

209
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,759
so another not so obvious benefit

210
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,720
rolling back your version control

211
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,319
you make a change it's easier to roll

212
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,759
back we'll get into that a little bit

213
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,479
more with the ci cd stuff

214
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,799
it's reliable it's repeatable is manual

215
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,880
when you're just doing iac if you go

216
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,559
into devops it's not some manual anymore

217
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,159
it also enables business process

218
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,480
automation for you business types

219
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360
there's your buzzword

220
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
tagging we'll talk about that as well

221
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
all right so

222
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
principles and concepts

223
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
let's follow some practices

224
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
um i didn't use as many memes as i did

225
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,320
last presentation so

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
here's a couple for you though

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
some days i feel like

228
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
the dos equis guys some days i feel like

229
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
the husky um

230
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,839
you know what is

231
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,279
these concepts it's one of those things

232
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,000
it's a rabbit hole you know where you

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
you start learning one thing and you

234
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
find that oh there's another way to do

235
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
this or there's a better way there's

236
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
more levels we'll talk about some of

237
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
those levels as well

238
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,080
but really

239
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,680
uh the big title what's wrong with your

240
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
2009 script anyone here just have a huge

241
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,120
script that they run i know

242
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
i currently do i'm working on moving

243
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,480
away from it but

244
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
uh there's nothing wrong with that cloud

245
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
formation templates if you use them

246
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,120
extensively they get very big and it get

247
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
out gets out of hand really quickly

248
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,519
so

249
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,959
there's nothing wrong with it though if

250
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
you're if you like doing that

251
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
if you are comfortable with your cloud

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,880
formation template

253
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
that is code it's infrastructure as code

254
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,600
just be aware that

255
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,519
it gets unmanageable pretty quickly

256
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,880
so if you like it you can keep it

257
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
otherwise

258
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
let's look at another way

259
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,000
one of the big things we talked about

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,839
don't repeat yourself try the

261
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,440
programming principle so code needs to

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,240
be reusable so if i write code i

263
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,040
shouldn't be writing the same code

264
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,360
again you know i should be able to reuse

265
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
the code i've written leverage what i've

266
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
already done otherwise i'm repeating

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
myself

268
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
and repetition and programming is bad

269
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
so why not just reuse our code that's

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
how objectorian principles come into

271
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,519
play here so as if i treat my code as

272
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,079
objects it doesn't matter when i use

273
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,519
those objects

274
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
they're available for reuse

275
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
also documentation on code libraries is

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
important you need to know how to

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,800
interface with your objects in your code

278
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,360
a single responsibility principle

279
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
and the the kiss method

280
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
i apply the kiss method to a lot of

281
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,880
things i do try to keep things simple

282
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
try to keep them understandable because

283
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,519
as soon as they start getting complex

284
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,959
you know within a company i used to work

285
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,399
at

286
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,240
if you started presenting something and

287
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
you got the response of

288
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
that sounds complicated let me think

289
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
about it the answer was no

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
so keeping things complex really keeps

291
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,399
people engaged

292
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
whereas you start going over people's

293
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
heads they just kind of space out

294
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
so what's the difference

295
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,360
between our object-oriented programming

296
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,399
scripting

297
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
so in procedural programming or writing

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
a script you just have stepwise one two

299
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
three with object-oriented programming

300
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079
you have

301
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,680
whatever whenever wherever i need to

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
call it so i still have my logic i still

303
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
have my flow but i now

304
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,680
maybe i jump around a bit maybe i

305
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,279
break my code up into different files to

306
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,480
manage them easier

307
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
and then i call those objects in those

308
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,680
files so it's not one two three

309
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
but it's actually easier to read because

310
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,639
my main file is not so cluttered you

311
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,920
know because i have references to

312
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,519
objects and then knowing what those

313
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,040
objects do is also important

314
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,639
so

315
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
some concepts

316
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,760
at the high level

317
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
code should be reusable we've went over

318
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,839
that loose coupling

319
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,760
this is really important

320
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,519
concept to understand is well if i have

321
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,959
dependencies

322
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,160
those dependencies are going to hurt me

323
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
in the long run because when i go over

324
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,160
if your business is siloed or even if

325
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
it's not but if you try to take what

326
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,399
you've done and it's got dependencies

327
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,839
and move it to another business or

328
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
another part or even another

329
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,279
organization you need to have all those

330
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,040
parts move whereas if i'm loosely

331
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
coupled

332
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
i can move one part and not depend on

333
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,279
the other

334
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,279
so object-oriented programming really

335
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,279
hits home on that too it's a lot easier

336
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,600
to move classes versus

337
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
your script

338
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,519
so classes inheritance from parent

339
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,639
classes

340
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,639
passing objects

341
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,920
those are some of the principles that we

342
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,000
can apply

343
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
all right so here's that ugly code i

344
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
promised you

345
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,240
pretty quick we'll step through it

346
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,880
this is just an example of using

347
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,279
object oriented programming

348
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
the bottom part is actually the

349
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
execution you can imagine if that's in a

350
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
different file it's just put up here on

351
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,519
the same file as

352
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,959
for simplicity

353
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
but basically i'm creating my class

354
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
creating my objects

355
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,959
having instantiation so my

356
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
initialization of them

357
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,399
but

358
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,000
i have a method to get and set the

359
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
object

360
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,519
and in this case it's just a simple

361
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,800
vpc which is a network so vpc

362
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
ip subnet

363
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,720
pretty simple pretty uh quick

364
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,120
uh if you were to use cloud formation

365
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
this would probably be three times as

366
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,920
long

367
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
to set your vpc up

368
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
all right so we've gotten the basics now

369
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
but

370
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,800
now we're really going to get into

371
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,079
some programming concepts

372
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,199
we're going to look

373
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,959
at two patterns

374
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,399
this book kind of

375
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,720
just for historical context this book

376
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,760
brought to the forefront some

377
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,920
programming concepts and patterns

378
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
that are still in use today so

379
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
if you have interested in object

380
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
oriented programming and want to take it

381
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,839
to the next level

382
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,199
definitely

383
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
pick up a book or at least some of these

384
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,320
ideas and concepts

385
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
so to the first pattern we're going to

386
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,240
look at is the factory pattern

387
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,480
it's a creational design pattern with a

388
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
common interface so you create your

389
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
infrastructure and regardless of what

390
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,720
you're creating it's always going to hit

391
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
the same interface

392
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
for me this is the next logical step if

393
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
you already have a script and you want

394
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,000
to take that script to object-oriented

395
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
programming

396
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
factory pattern is a

397
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,760
quickest way to get there

398
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
next is the builder pattern so the

399
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
builder pattern

400
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,079
is nicer when you don't have that

401
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,160
succinct

402
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
environment if your environment has lots

403
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
of variables if you're deploying

404
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
different environments with different

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
pieces of infrastructure the builder

406
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,440
pattern is pretty much better way to go

407
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
the builder pattern focuses on using

408
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
pieces and parts versus the hole

409
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,000
and then you can take those pieces and

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,199
parts and build your environment

411
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,199
with those whereas the factory kind of

412
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
builds the whole environment

413
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,399
as is

414
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,199
with

415
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
you can change it up too but

416
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,920
it's easier to do piece by piece with

417
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,800
the builder pattern

418
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,240
okay so moving to modeling complex

419
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,720
information systems

420
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,279
all right so this is something that i've

421
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
presented actually at one of the rvsec

422
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,720
monthly meetings it's my automation

423
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,759
worksheet

424
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,920
and basically it's very simple but it

425
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,639
helps me get my thoughts down to move

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,360
this into an infrastructure as code

427
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,399
worksheet

428
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,959
mostly get my prerequisites so i think

429
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,800
think about things like

430
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
what are my dependencies what do i need

431
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,600
to be successful

432
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,040
if you work in a

433
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
compliant environment a very strict

434
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
environment do i need my build tickets

435
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
do i need reference tickets numbers

436
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,360
what modules might it need we saw the ip

437
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
address module in the earlier code

438
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,959
what other modules might i need

439
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,560
do i need to test those modules before

440
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,519
using them in my code

441
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
existing classes other people have

442
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,480
written

443
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,519
do i already have code i can leverage

444
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,519
additional resources i'll need do i need

445
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,440
other developers do i need network

446
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
configs

447
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,519
warnings known issues gotchas i might

448
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
hit

449
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,759
timeline is probably a good one to add

450
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,399
in here as well

451
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
so my pseudo code

452
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
this is a great programming concept that

453
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
i like to apply but basically i import

454
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,919
my modules this is what i'm going to do

455
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,760
i don't have to worry about my syntax i

456
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,359
don't have to worry about

457
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,039
if it's going to work this is just

458
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,599
getting my thoughts clear and getting my

459
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,319
steps defined and how i want to actually

460
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,359
build my infrastructure

461
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
and even this to me is a little bit more

462
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,679
detailed i like to personally go a

463
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,679
little bit more free form than what's on

464
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,240
this page

465
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,559
for my operations

466
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,080
this is actually i consider this more of

467
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
a database concept but we'll borrow it

468
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
for our playbook on infrastructure

469
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,080
basically anything i do with my

470
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,240
infrastructure boils down to i'm either

471
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,760
creating something

472
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
i'm going to read and retrieve it

473
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,280
i'm going to update something that's

474
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
already there

475
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,919
or i'm going to delete something that

476
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,440
exists

477
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
also we'll add upsert

478
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,880
upser is kind of doesn't fall into any

479
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
of the ones above so i just added it

480
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
basically it says make sure something

481
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
exists and if it already exists make

482
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,919
sure it's set to this specific

483
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,840
configuration

484
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,440
so you don't have to do your check you

485
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,000
know does it exist if it does exist

486
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,080
makes you know make sure it is this if

487
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,000
it doesn't exist create it the logic is

488
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,280
already built into an absurd operation

489
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,919
so now we need to map this to our

490
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,360
infrastructure it's called practice and

491
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,640
principle

492
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
how do we do this well everything is an

493
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,679
api call today

494
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,799
you know

495
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,240
everything literally everything is an

496
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,640
api call or

497
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,919
can be so mapping that to our crud

498
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,600
operations

499
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
is pretty important the most obvious and

500
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
common one is get git does a few things

501
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,400
get re

502
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
first off it's very easy to

503
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
to accomplish a get request you don't

504
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,120
have parameters generally but the get

505
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
request also

506
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
test my authentication and authorization

507
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
so if i can do a get request i know that

508
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
that's good to go i can move on to doing

509
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,760
more complicated things like doing

510
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,720
updates doing deletes

511
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,559
patch i don't really use very much but

512
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,320
it is their

513
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,840
post um probably more so

514
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,600
or i'm sorry put more so

515
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
all right anyone here use postman

516
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
all right good

517
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,640
postman is pretty awesome um i think

518
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
postman create very easy to create api

519
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,799
calls

520
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,720
very extensive libraries

521
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,080
they now have

522
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,679
modules available you just download the

523
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,360
module fill out your parameters and

524
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,679
create your api call so getting from

525
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,840
my pseudo code of what i want to do to

526
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
mapping out to those api operations now

527
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,919
i can actually syntactically create

528
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,559
those api operations with postman so

529
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,320
postman is a tool

530
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,000
pretty nice to leverage api calls with

531
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,520
here's an example

532
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
this one

533
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
using the aws library again just fill in

534
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,039
your parameters

535
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,760
pull your data

536
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
one thing i noticed right off the bat

537
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,559
with this

538
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,440
is

539
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
the amount of data that's returned is

540
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,880
kind of insane

541
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,559
so you have to account for that

542
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,240
be able to parse it there's ways

543
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
documenting ways to do that but we'll go

544
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,799
into what

545
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
maybe another way to do this

546
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,039
one of the cool features i like this is

547
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,840
a

548
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
stupid developer trick

549
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
we'll call it but basically

550
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,440
in postman you just go to code and you

551
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
can create your

552
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
python or whatever other code you want

553
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,880
for your api call so i get my api call

554
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,720
down in postman hit a button and now

555
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
i've got my my code i can use in my

556
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,720
language

557
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,799
which brings us to

558
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
our software development kits so now

559
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,880
we're going more on the developer side

560
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,360
so as i said i'm kind of python back

561
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,480
background

562
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,480
python sdks are readily available

563
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
they're cloud dependent though so you

564
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,480
need your sdk for what you're doing

565
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
so now you're getting more into am i

566
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
doing aws well now i need the bottom

567
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,360
three sdk am i doing vmware well i need

568
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,000
you know the nsx sdk so it depends on

569
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
your cloud it's cloud dependent but

570
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,360
a little bit more powerful a little bit

571
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,640
more streamlined

572
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,880
also your cloud vendors do document

573
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,760
these

574
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,520
fairly well

575
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
minus one of them which i won't mention

576
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,840
which one that is

577
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,000
uh here's a here's an example

578
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,080
so again this is doing the same thing

579
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,919
that we saw in postman

580
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,360
um

581
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
the return is

582
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
about the same but

583
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,159
the code for this is pretty elegant

584
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,159
what you don't see on here is the off

585
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,440
and off z portion but that you can write

586
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
as a class

587
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
make it an object and pass it into this

588
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,080
and you'll be good to go

589
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
so i used to think oh yeah this is all

590
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,320
great for all languages but then i

591
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,679
looked at the java example and um

592
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,720
that's why i don't do java no i just

593
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,080
um

594
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,159
i don't do java because i i stick with

595
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,159
python because i like it

596
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,360
but anyway

597
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,159
um the point being here is that there

598
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,000
are sdks for other languages that are

599
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,559
usable so if you are java or other like

600
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,960
if you're a go developer there's sdks

601
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,200
for your clouds

602
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,960
which would allow you to leverage

603
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,159
object-oriented programming

604
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,360
me

605
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
so api is a simple way

606
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,799
sdks now we're getting a little bit more

607
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,400
flexible really getting more to the

608
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,720
object-oriented approach

609
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,640
api calls generally be swapped out for

610
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,480
your sdk

611
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,760
objects classes methods

612
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
so if you want to create a vm in azure

613
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
versus creating a

614
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,280
instance in aws it's going to be

615
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,600
different

616
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
all right so now we get a little bit

617
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
more into

618
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,080
some different tooling this is uh

619
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
configuration management tools

620
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,400
so your puppet chef ansible

621
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
uh those type of tools

622
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,520
uh we're gonna leverage those for clouds

623
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,120
so we have cloud agnostic ones i

624
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
mentioned some of those salt is in there

625
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,240
uh

626
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,159
terraforms in there uh we mentioned

627
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,039
terraform a few earlier talks

628
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
and then you have your specific

629
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
cloud tools so

630
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,159
cloudformation the aws cdk which is kind

631
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,400
of a hybrid of a sdk

632
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
terraform its own language interacts

633
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,600
with python so the cdk is kind of the

634
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
dark horse and all this

635
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,760
azure resource manager templates

636
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,640
gcp has theirs and vmware viewrealize

637
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,279
orchestrator uh they do have a

638
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,919
sdk i believe definitely do have an api

639
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,559
and a gui

640
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,559
your templates basically define your

641
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
infrastructure i want this

642
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
defined go

643
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,120
object-oriented programming kind of has

644
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,720
an advantage of

645
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,960
well not unless you can do it this way

646
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,320
but you could also say well i already

647
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
have this but what do i want different

648
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
or based on this that i already have

649
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,880
maybe i want to do some more logic so

650
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,960
that's where your

651
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
um principles come into play templates

652
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,880
just kind of define

653
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,799
your set i think a template's a great

654
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,799
starting point i don't think it's kind

655
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,880
of the end goal for a lot of places but

656
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
i think templates are the way to

657
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,360
uh to start

658
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
all right so

659
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,679
now where are we as an industry

660
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,919
are we using object-oriented

661
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,520
oriented stuff or are we at least using

662
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,760
some sdk are we using cloud formation

663
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
are we just defining our infrastructure

664
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,679
and so really crude attempt at research

665
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,960
going through

666
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,240
the github

667
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,360
search

668
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,720
bottle 3 which is python sdk for aws

669
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,400
you got about 2500 repos 92 000 commits

670
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,480
that's pretty good

671
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,919
because that's only one language don't

672
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,840
forget there's like java go and other

673
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
sdks out there

674
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,880
cloud formation

675
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
we have 2000 repos

676
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,240
48 000 commits so

677
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,760
that tells me that the industry is

678
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,120
embracing

679
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,279
these sdks and is primed for

680
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,279
object-oriented programming principles

681
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,000
to be applied

682
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
so now that i have these

683
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,320
this infrastructures code then we'll go

684
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,279
to the ci cd world well how do i do that

685
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,320
well it's

686
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,360
really

687
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,760
infrastructure is code is the first step

688
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,640
to go to ci cd you need your pipeline

689
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,919
in your pipeline you're going to do your

690
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,320
builds you're going to do your

691
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,440
tests

692
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
and then you're either going to deliver

693
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,279
or deploy depending on compliance

694
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,279
requirements or how comfortable you are

695
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,840
with doing a full automation suite

696
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
for my industry i work in the federal

697
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
government it's mostly delivery because

698
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,159
you need at least one manual process in

699
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,720
there to be a gatekeeper to say go or no

700
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
go

701
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,760
there's lots of opportunity for

702
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,919
automation in your cic pipeline of

703
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,159
course

704
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,440
you know all all the cloud players have

705
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,880
various tools to

706
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
automate this

707
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,200
the big thing to take away here is

708
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
there's a lot of information coming in

709
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,240
for devops and ci cd but start small

710
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
just just pick one thing like maybe i

711
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,000
have a firewall that i want to

712
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
start automating on so i'll start

713
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,679
writing some code we'll put that code

714
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
into a cic pipeline just for that one

715
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,919
firewall and then start expanding well

716
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
maybe i want all these other firewalls

717
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,760
and let's start from there

718
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,159
definitely don't try to eat the whole

719
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,559
elephant at once

720
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,240
you do have the security benefit in your

721
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,360
cic pipelines so now don't forget our

722
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,679
audit logs for infrastructure as code

723
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,000
we know who implemented a change because

724
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
they wrote the code we know what changed

725
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,559
once we go to ci cd for auditors we know

726
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,480
when it changed because we have logs of

727
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,440
that pipeline run and we know where it

728
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,960
changed we know where the code was

729
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,880
applied and to what environments

730
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,760
if you're looking for some more

731
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,640
training on this sans sec 540 which i'm

732
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,039
currently taking

733
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,279
is a great resource for this as well

734
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
but csc to devops so there is a

735
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,679
difference frequently you kind of hear

736
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,720
the terms

737
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,080
interchanged

738
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,840
i say oh yeah we're devops well

739
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
are you devops or are you just using a

740
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
cic pipeline well what's the difference

741
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
so

742
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,559
here we have the agile manifesto who's

743
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,880
seen this before

744
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,120
yeah okay

745
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,399
yeah it's been around it's kind of the

746
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,799
start of

747
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,399
devops

748
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
it's really a great read if you get time

749
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,600
i encourage you to read it if you think

750
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,679
about devops but it explains

751
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,039
you know

752
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
what devops is it's not a tool it's not

753
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
a technology

754
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,320
it's something that the whole

755
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,399
organization needs to buy into

756
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,000
it's something that's more about

757
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
the processes it's something more

758
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,360
about people working together

759
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,080
how to respond to changes versus

760
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,760
having

761
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,039
post mortems

762
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,440
and stuff

763
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,080
also you need support throughout the

764
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,919
entire org because in devops you're not

765
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,360
going to be working in the silo you'll

766
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,640
be working with

767
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
everyone

768
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,720
so that said uh let's go over a quick

769
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,799
review i would

770
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,240
define some terms objection programming

771
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
classes methods all that stuff that's

772
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
something to be more read up on

773
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,320
and not so much something to be

774
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,919
memorized

775
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,720
we went over some theory principles

776
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
and then we got into how to kind of

777
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,000
apply those with pseudocode

778
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,159
i got into some patterns i really

779
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,159
encourage you to check out the different

780
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,080
patterns that are available i went over

781
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,919
two of them the builder and the factory

782
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,880
method

783
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,240
and some of the benefits of those

784
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
we went into modeling complex

785
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,080
information systems

786
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,840
and finished up with config management

787
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,640
tools going into ci cd and devops

788
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,919
so for that went really fast

789
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,039
so left a lot of time for questions

790
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,840
so

791
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,158
any questions

792
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
yes

793
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,159
ah that's a good question

794
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,320
so how do you drive

795
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,279
um

796
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,440
we've been migrating to infrastructure

797
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,159
as code with staff who are resistant to

798
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,600
change

799
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,960
well that one

800
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,760
is actually fairly easy

801
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
so you start small with the small quick

802
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,640
wins

803
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,480
so pretty soon

804
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
the rest of the staff is going to notice

805
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,559
that you're sitting there drinking your

806
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,159
coffee while your code is being deployed

807
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,080
or tested or done

808
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,840
and they're writing their code or

809
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,559
they're

810
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,559
they're managing their infrastructure or

811
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,799
they're building and configuring things

812
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,120
like the network team is a great example

813
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,279
as i said i have a security background

814
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,679
focused on netsec

815
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,039
so this is one thing that we're

816
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,880
currently going through which is

817
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
managing firewalls anyone who's managed

818
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,440
firewalls or touched firewalls or looked

819
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
at cisco ios

820
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,159
knows that it's a bear and so

821
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,080
if you have your network team focus on

822
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,919
like one firewall

823
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,520
and say okay here's our code to manage

824
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,880
this firewall

825
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,399
and then start applying that

826
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,880
well they'll start noticing

827
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,279
the benefits it's quicker it's easier

828
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,799
i'm not stressed out because i'm not

829
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,200
worried about mistyping a configuration

830
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,519
or an acl that takes down the network

831
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,760
you know i am i have my code it's been

832
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,919
vetted uh it's been peer reviewed that's

833
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,159
another big part of this uh which also

834
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,320
helps with audits and compliance

835
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,480
so i'm i'm less stressed out

836
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,440
okay

837
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,960
so that starts catching on so the pretty

838
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,399
soon your network team

839
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,559
starts catching on um

840
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,559
and then so your database team notices

841
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,159
those network guys they sure do drink a

842
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,159
lot of coffee i wonder wonder who's

843
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,960
managing their network oh it's code

844
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,799
oh they're code repos the code repo is a

845
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,120
big one too

846
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,320
you know any everyone likes to

847
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,399
contribute to code repos

848
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,480
you can see what's going on

849
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
so pretty soon your database team goes

850
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,279
you know what

851
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,360
the sql queries i don't really

852
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,200
like writing those every time let me put

853
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,559
them in this code

854
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,600
so

855
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,039
that's a good way start realizing the

856
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,799
efficiencies start small small quick

857
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,760
wins

858
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,879
is is a key to

859
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:32,720
school success

860
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,720
um

861
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,559
yeah yeah that's another nice thing to

862
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
point out is uh a lot of the

863
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,559
organizations a lot of the big

864
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,519
enterprises have recognized the value of

865
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,919
infrastructure code and devops and the

866
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,840
movement towards it so you are starting

867
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
to see a lot of vendors

868
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,760
and

869
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,919
and manufacturers integrate

870
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,399
with things like ansible puppet chef you

871
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,440
know they're starting to write their own

872
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,640
modules

873
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,080
putting them on github so you can see

874
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,480
what the code does exactly so if it fits

875
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,679
your needs or even if you want to

876
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,320
contribute to it it's there for you so

877
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,439
thanks great example

878
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
any other questions

879
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
yes

880
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,120
um

881
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,559
yeah so

882
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,240
uh

883
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,799
i'll admit uh i was i'm probably there

884
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,279
myself whereas that the patterns book is

885
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,960
the next step up for me

886
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,320
uh so how do i get to that step or

887
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,079
wherever you're at how do you get you

888
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,679
know to the next level

889
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,839
and first is recognizing where you're at

890
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,040
so

891
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,560
i'm assuming most folks in here can

892
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,520
write a script whatever language it is

893
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,960
doesn't matter it's bash python

894
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
powershell ruby

895
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,199
um you know anything right you write a

896
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
script next step would be going into

897
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,320
object-oriented programming concepts so

898
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,719
can you do object-oriented programming

899
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,480
in your language is the first question

900
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,760
if not then this can't apply

901
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,359
but in python which i found to be the

902
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,320
easiest yes go to go get some

903
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,239
object-oriented programming with python

904
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,760
education

905
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,440
linkedin learning has a really good

906
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,000
course if you have access to that

907
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,399
a cloud guru has a great course

908
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,079
if you have access to that

909
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,839
there's open source references on the

910
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:56,719
web

911
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,520
there's lots of python documentation out

912
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,480
there

913
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,240
again that's my background if you if you

914
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,160
like go or whatever i'm sure there's

915
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,480
resources out there so start going into

916
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,240
object oriented programming

917
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,680
and once you get comfortable with those

918
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,560
concepts like i showed decorators

919
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
there's like magic methods all you know

920
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,200
all that kind of stuff that's

921
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,720
maybe foreign to someone who just does

922
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,400
scripting once you get comfortable with

923
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
object-oriented programming concepts

924
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
then go into your patterns and it'll

925
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
make a lot more sense

926
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,720
because if you just jump into patterns

927
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,079
it can be very very overwhelming

928
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,320
good question

929
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,320
yes

930
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,359
right uh good question so the question

931
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,680
is if you have a smaller organization or

932
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,040
if you have an organization that's

933
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,160
focused on segregation of duties how do

934
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,760
you move that to devops

935
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,440
and

936
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
i think the response for a smaller

937
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,000
organization is pretty simple uh

938
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,599
you know we're not simple it's probably

939
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,760
easier to get folks on board because you

940
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,599
work with everybody so you can

941
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,839
evangelize hey we want to move devops we

942
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,280
want to be agile

943
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,560
you know and knowing everybody you can

944
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
work with everybody

945
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,839
the second part of that question the

946
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,920
segregation is a little bit harder

947
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,760
because you can't really have your

948
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,599
segregation and have your devops um

949
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,320
co-exist you have to say i might be a

950
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
netseq developer but i have to work with

951
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,359
the windows developer now you know and

952
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,839
we have to make make networking work

953
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,480
together or

954
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,400
uh for prime example

955
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,720
you have an organization who hires

956
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
sysadmins right sets that means to

957
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,960
manage your systems well if you notice

958
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
here infrastructure as code is more

959
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,560
about development than system management

960
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,800
yes i need my parameters to know

961
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,920
you know

962
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,240
maybe maybe what processes i need open

963
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,480
or system management type stuff doing

964
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,400
iem i need i still need

965
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
that expertise but now i put it in code

966
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,040
so i need that added developer code

967
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,800
so it's a little harder to do with

968
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
segregation of duties but keep in mind

969
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,400
you still need that segregation of

970
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,280
expertise maybe working together that's

971
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,720
that's what i would

972
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,440
probably say would work

973
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,920
so yeah definitely as you saw

974
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,640
in the manifesto

975
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,800
not so much segregated

976
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,160
more about working together

977
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,000
cross-collaboration and that's that's

978
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
how agile works so if you have a company

979
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,560
say oh we're moving to agile okay great

980
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,760
can't wait for everyone to start working

981
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,280
together and break down these silos

982
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,240
uh any other questions

983
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,800
okay great

984
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,640
i'll be around tomorrow if anyone has

985
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
any discussions

986
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,400
again encourage everyone to look at the

987
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,560
links on the slides in the slide deck

988
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,800
it'll be posted shortly

989
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,040
and

990
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,480
thanks again for attending my

991
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,320
presentation and hope you have enjoyed

992
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,100
the rest of the conference

993
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:36,560
[Applause]

994
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,640
you
