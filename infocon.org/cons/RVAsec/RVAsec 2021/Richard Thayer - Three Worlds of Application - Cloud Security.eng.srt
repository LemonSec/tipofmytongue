1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
okay so we're going to get started on a

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,039
topic that a lot of people

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,359
act like they know what it is

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,160
um

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
me too yeah

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,439
and then we're also going to turn around

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,000
and see exactly how if it's truly going

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,560
to fit us or not

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
maybe uh turn it down a little bit

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
i've got my rockstar

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
um

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,760
so

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,360
application and cloud security go hand

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,239
in hand why because they're all what

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,680
they're all applications cloud's an

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,879
application right everything you do

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,280
inside the cloud is an application

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,800
so

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,719
below the title i put something down

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,680
that

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,440
i've had so many people ask me when i

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
give this presentation

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,399
wait this is all connected and it is and

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,359
i'm going to show you how it's all

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,399
connected

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
so just as a quick heads up this is kind

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,280
of what we're going to look at in

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
regards to these three worlds now why do

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
i say worlds it could be phases it could

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
be steps

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,840
but we're trying to think bigger

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,640
right so first world is is going left

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
some people know what that means other

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,159
people's don't what go left means on the

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,759
cloud and application security world

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,960
this is

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
we're going to talk about the developers

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,600
a little bit

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,320
right we're going to get into the devops

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,080
the cicd pipeline

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,520
and then also at the same time what does

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
devsecops mean some people say well it's

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,079
actually devops

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,040
tomato tomata i can't spell either one

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,920
okay

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
next one down is we're going to go

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,560
native

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
in regards to cloud native what does

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,479
native mean it does not mean roasting

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
your management over an open fire about

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
that kind of native

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
we're also going to get into a heart

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,640
touching and a very emotionally warm

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
conversation about the wizard of oz

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,320
does that sound like application

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
security it does to me i'm on medicine

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,399
that could help

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,680
what's the next thing we're going to

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,799
look at world 3 what is grc

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
okay it is not the bus you ride in

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,878
richmond there's also other things

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,920
security policies governance right

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,680
process procedures and then the last

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
we're going to take turns point fingers

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
isn't that important

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,800
so here's my disclaimer here's my notice

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
people say what is application security

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
application security

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
i lost my mouse

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,079
application security is

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,879
the application

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
it's what consumes

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
it's what generates it's what

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
manipulates data

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,599
but it's not the data

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,440
and it's not the info the infrastructure

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,959
not below it right because then you have

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,400
data set

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,879
then you have infosec it's everything

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,720
that's in between so

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
somebody always says

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,400
well richard what about cloud

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
well cloud is an application and some of

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
the networking that we can do inside of

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
that is based on applications right

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,159
but there's a barrier there we're going

87
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
to show it out that is

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
so

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,440
how many people here have ever heard of

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
an ss dlc

91
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,920
nine

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
six five okay around enough we're going

93
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,280
to say 100.

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
so with that

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
ssdlc is is is what it's a secure

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,519
software development lifecycle

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,440
sdlc was originated in the 60s

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
do you realize it's been around that

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
long

100
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
and what's happened is it's been morphed

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,400
it's been

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,799
twisted around it's been consolidated

103
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
into oh sdlc is the environment oh it's

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,840
our qa environment it's test it's

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,760
death right or it's

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
staging

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
but that's not what sdlc is those are

108
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
just the environments that you use stlc

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,040
is more of

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
getting into okay

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
are we planning for it what's the

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,480
analysis

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
of this application or this system that

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,840
we're putting through

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
okay is it designed correctly

116
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
what about when we build it

117
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
are we using that correctly

118
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
then we start getting into the testing

119
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
that everybody's familiar with oh qa

120
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,798
smoke all that's all kind of stuff then

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,160
we get into

122
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
the maintenance see with agile it's

123
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,358
different there's that maintenance

124
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,360
structure that's constantly reiterating

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
the cicd pipeline

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
so while we're using it

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
are we actually using the phases

128
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
part of the design phase means that

129
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,680
there needs to be an hld in an lld

130
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
anybody know what those are

131
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
they're not social diseases it's a high

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,199
level design and a low level design

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,320
right

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
do we have those

135
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,759
if you don't have those you need to walk

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,120
up to people that are in charge of

137
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,320
development

138
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
and do this

139
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
and tell them to put their face in it

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
because something's wrong

141
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
we need to be able to make sure that

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,520
these guys understand this is important

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,639
what about

144
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,720
we heard a little bit about

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,240
coding

146
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,800
so software coding or the secure

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,440
software coding practices there's five

148
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
of them

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
well there are yeah there's more than

150
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
that but basically there's five key ones

151
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,160
most people say i never put my username

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
and password in my code

153
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
that's one little tiny piece

154
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
because when you start thinking about

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
the authentication

156
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,960
the authorization

157
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
the validation

158
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
the system system management and above

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,160
all

160
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
cryptography

161
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,759
guess what now you're really coding

162
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,880
something

163
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
because unless you have all five around

164
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,919
play

165
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,360
somebody needs to take a step back and

166
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
evaluate the software and say hmm

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
you're missing one of these

168
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
or it's not strong enough

169
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
right

170
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
vulnerabilities now we've talked a lot

171
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,880
about vulnerabilities

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,840
what's the difference between a

173
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,080
vulnerability and an exploit

174
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
well the easy and simple answer is

175
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,759
an exploit is taken advantage of a

176
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,520
vulnerability

177
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,319
does every vulnerability have an exploit

178
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
no it doesn't i like this guy he's like

179
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
oh no no

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,440
no

181
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,800
it doesn't

182
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
but if a vulnerability is act upon now

183
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
it's exploited

184
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
who wants to be in that

185
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
office right there in front of the cio

186
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
the cso the lmnop whatever office

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
letters they have

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
and have them

189
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,919
asking you why would this happen

190
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,000
i've been there i don't like it i don't

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
think you like it either

192
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,039
so vulnerabilities when we start looking

193
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,039
at that we say okay

194
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
my god we have some rules here no

195
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
criticals in our code

196
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
that's pretty simple that makes a lot of

197
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
sense no criticals

198
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,199
hey we're living on the edge

199
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
no highs

200
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,599
okay well you took a kind of step no

201
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,520
highs

202
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,759
but do you have mediums well you know we

203
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
might have watched mediums you know

204
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
what if you had 30 mediums they're not

205
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
high or critical

206
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,919
does that count

207
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,080
what's the weighted value of a medium

208
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,759
compared to high

209
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,400
if i got 10 mediums

210
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
which one's more valuable or which one

211
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,039
should i watch more than the high

212
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,840
nope only two mediums come on we got

213
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,160
standards fantastic

214
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
how many lows equal a medium

215
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,479
because what risk is going to turn

216
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
around risk is going to come and say

217
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,080
oh i see that you have all these

218
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,000
different markers each one of these

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
markers are worth something so part of

220
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,319
your application security says you're

221
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,800
inducing code or libraries jar files

222
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
whatever it may be

223
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
into the environment that puts us at

224
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
risk

225
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
how do we handle that

226
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,560
that is part of the policy part of the

227
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,599
process

228
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,120
finding out what those borders and

229
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
gateways are

230
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
so and there's always somebody there in

231
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
your company that's willing to tell you

232
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,479
what that is

233
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,360
next thing security testing

234
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
sca

235
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
right software composition analysis

236
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
static code analysis there are

237
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
differences what about security or

238
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
try that one more time secure

239
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
application static

240
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
see how it was dropped a lot as a child

241
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,720
static application security testing

242
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
right

243
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
dynamic application security testing

244
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
interactive application security testing

245
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
what is rasp real-time application

246
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
security protection is it no

247
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,679
is that right no it's not is it

248
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
real-time application

249
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,599
software

250
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,479
come on out somebody

251
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
nobody

252
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
you're this is kind of interactive you

253
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,120
know it's just not going well i see okay

254
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,279
all right so what would let's move on so

255
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
we understand exactly what regression

256
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
testing is smoke testing qa

257
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
def right

258
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
but what other kinds of testing can you

259
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
do

260
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
see because when you're doing testing

261
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,959
are you layering it on top of each other

262
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,240
that's the whole premise of devsecops

263
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
are you doing dev psychopaths and you

264
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
don't even know it

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
well let's take a look at what their

266
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,839
cyclops might look like

267
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,080
so across the top there we see

268
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,160
we saw our ssdlc that we talked about a

269
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,839
minute ago right

270
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,080
but how does that relate to the five

271
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
phases of devsecops

272
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,000
so if we if we take all five in we say

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,760
okay well there we have the code repos

274
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,839
or the code

275
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,440
then we go into pre-build what kind of

276
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,519
testing are you doing

277
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
wise

278
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
against your application

279
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
before it goes into the third phase and

280
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,160
the third phase is what build

281
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
build is huge

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
what's after build a lot of people say

283
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,279
post build that's absolutely right but

284
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,200
what are you doing post build

285
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,560
you're testing

286
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
you're moving into qa sometimes your qa

287
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
people are third parties are they doing

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
it the right way who knows then you go

289
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
into artifact repositories or runtimes

290
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
why is that different than production

291
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
because not everything that's spun it up

292
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
and is running

293
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
is protected

294
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,519
why isn't it protected

295
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,920
well it's in devon test who's protecting

296
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
devon test a vulnerability is a

297
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
vulnerability no matter which sdlc

298
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
environment you use it in

299
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,560
right

300
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
so runtime we have to turn around and

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
take a look at that

302
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,519
so there's strategic needs and there's

303
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,160
tactical needs for devsecops strategic

304
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,120
mean

305
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,959
what are your standards

306
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,560
what are the policies that are governing

307
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,920
this

308
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
are you setting up specific security

309
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,880
requirements that says hey the standard

310
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,480
for a wife

311
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,200
says it's got to stop the oauth top 10.

312
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
fantastic

313
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,680
what's the requirement though

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
well i thought that was no that's not

315
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
the same the requirement might be how

316
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
it's going to be used

317
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,399
what vendor you're going to use it could

318
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,320
be a lot of things depends on your

319
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
organization on how it's taken care of

320
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
so you have strategic needs for policies

321
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,399
procedures

322
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
standards requirements and then you have

323
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,279
tactical

324
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
what's the tactical sign tactical is

325
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,519
where the rubber hits the road

326
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,279
so in the examples that i have there

327
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,880
obviously with my glasses i can't read

328
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,000
them good but luckily i got them right

329
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,880
here we have example pieces of software

330
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
testing tools right

331
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,320
some of them you've heard of some of you

332
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,839
haven't just look them up the idea

333
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,760
behind it is is are you layering your

334
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
security in each different one of these

335
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
phases

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
because if something comes from code

337
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
and goes into sas

338
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
and it fails

339
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
do you move it ahead because you're

340
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,279
under a time crunch

341
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,800
are you going to sell stuff to help

342
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,519
cover the company's loss

343
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,959
i'm not

344
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,560
so what do we do

345
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
well when it's being spun up are we

346
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
automating with our cicd pipelines to

347
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
turn around and pull these tools

348
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,200
responses

349
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
into our

350
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,760
pipelines are we doing that

351
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
well it passed okay fantastic but as

352
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,519
soon as we turned around and started

353
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
using dynamic testing using

354
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
authentication and authorization what

355
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
happened

356
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,680
it broke what do we do to fix it

357
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,519
do we stop and say what was that

358
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
automation piece that died

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,839
do we automatically go into i asked and

360
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,680
have users actually trying to hit on it

361
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,440
break on it test it

362
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,120
when we know that there are already a

363
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,639
problem before

364
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,320
so depending upon each one of those

365
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,279
tools

366
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,920
that you use the output

367
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,760
should give you the go or no go for the

368
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,440
next phase

369
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
right

370
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
so what are we doing we're layering

371
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,360
security we're layering it on top of

372
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,320
that

373
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,079
one level at a time

374
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,639
that way when somebody says

375
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,360
do you did

376
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,399
you know what did is

377
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,040
well we're all security keys

378
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
defense in depth

379
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,839
do you

380
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,399
defense in depth do you provide layers

381
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
of security as you're moving forward

382
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,360
across your application plane

383
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
remember i don't care about your

384
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
firewalls don't care about the routers

385
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
are you doing this with your application

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
because what happens when it turns when

387
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,959
we start putting into a production

388
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
environment it becomes something called

389
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,920
a

390
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
workload

391
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,639
right

392
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,200
we all heard that it's a workflow it's

393
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,920
no longer it's a server in production

394
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,279
most of the time anymore we don't have

395
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,560
that especially on the application

396
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,519
layers

397
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,480
aka containers microservices

398
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,959
serverless computing

399
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,000
so

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,760
with that being said we have to turn

401
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
around and we say okay i get a good

402
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,440
understanding of what application

403
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,639
security is

404
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,399
i've got it

405
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,639
so what do we do next

406
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,399
we figure out why my screen will go for

407
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,839
it

408
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,839
yeah

409
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
the arrow button

410
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,360
that works

411
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,519
so we go native

412
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,800
so here we went through the development

413
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,079
process we turned around we looked at

414
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
different things that make this happen

415
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,720
now we're looking at native tools

416
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
what does native mean

417
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
so everybody immediately assumes native

418
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,399
tools are what's immediate only what's

419
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
in the cloud and that's not true we have

420
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
needed

421
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
tools inside of our production

422
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
environments now that are on-prem

423
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
firewalls application gateways

424
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,720
there's two different types of

425
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
application gateways right

426
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,480
one's an authenticating gateway and the

427
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,360
other one is a collective gateway

428
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
which one are you using are you doing

429
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
reporting on them

430
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,160
same thing with low balancers load

431
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
balancers have had feature firewall

432
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,079
feature sets

433
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,800
forever for as long as i can remember

434
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
being able to turn around and restrict

435
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
according to port

436
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
setting up dips

437
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,399
right that's a security mechanism but at

438
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,440
the same time it provides additional

439
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
um functionality

440
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
so web application firewalls you're

441
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,680
going to hear most

442
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,839
application security guys will say you

443
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,680
need a wife

444
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
you need to be able to stop the oh watch

445
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,880
top 10.

446
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
what about the sans 25

447
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
that's a little bit more detailed

448
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
but just stopping it is one thing are

449
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,240
you watching are you seeing that you're

450
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,000
actually stopping it

451
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
are you layering it in also are you

452
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,719
using a cdn

453
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
everything that you do on your

454
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
application

455
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,680
decides how secure your environment is

456
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,800
going to be

457
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
it also decides how long you keep your

458
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,440
job

459
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
right

460
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
because the first time that thing gets

461
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,959
worked what happens

462
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,800
hey you did a great job by now

463
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
so we have to turn around and we have to

464
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,399
figure that out so industries asgs

465
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,560
network security groups or security

466
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
groups how about application security

467
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,279
groups

468
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,720
they're all

469
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,680
there to provide smaller boundaries for

470
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
our applications and our workloads

471
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
they're all there

472
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
are you taking advantage of it

473
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
hey i'm in the cloud and my security

474
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,440
group says only 22 can go through tcp 22

475
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
that's fantastic

476
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,839
what about outbound

477
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,519
if you're allowing anything that's

478
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,959
inside

479
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,440
that little area your network security

480
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,959
group to be able to talk to the entire

481
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,480
world

482
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
to exploit your entire network i only

483
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
got to get in one

484
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,440
how are you handling that

485
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,399
again application security are back abac

486
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,240
and obac

487
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,759
how many people have heard of abac and

488
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,040
ovac

489
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,839
yeah

490
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,959
okay attribute based access controls

491
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,880
make your application

492
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,040
start telling you hey i'm authorized to

493
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,639
do this

494
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
hey i'm in a group according to these

495
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,079
other applications that says that i can

496
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,920
communicate with the internet or i can't

497
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
obac

498
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
is object-based access control what's

499
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,399
the number one consumer of obac

500
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,240
iot

501
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,839
they're the number one

502
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,720
so again we're using

503
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,799
normals that we're familiar with in

504
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
regards to security we're using it to

505
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,280
turn around and protect our applications

506
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
we're protecting our devices that are

507
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
using the applications

508
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,679
and eventually we're going to be

509
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,359
protecting the people that use the

510
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,679
applications individually

511
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,280
so key vaults key stores you guys

512
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
understand what those do

513
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
paper policy cloud policy we're going to

514
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,160
get in a little bit more of that how can

515
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,840
you have a secure cloud if you have no

516
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,440
policy no procedure

517
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
right

518
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,240
containers kubernetes

519
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,799
micro services

520
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,080
so

521
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,679
talk with the financial company and they

522
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,720
have

523
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
microservices and i said that's

524
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
fantastic

525
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
how are you securing them

526
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,960
uh

527
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
with the firewall

528
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,600
does that cover a microservice

529
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,679
see it restricts on that layer three and

530
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,120
four

531
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
but it doesn't go any up to where six

532
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
and seven is especially if you're doing

533
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,360
rest calls for that micro service

534
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,400
then when i turn around and i start

535
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
making comments about service mesh

536
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
how many how many of us are familiar

537
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
with surface measures

538
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,480
it is the underlying tool that you can

539
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,280
use to secure your applications on the

540
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
fly

541
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,640
now with containers you also have

542
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,799
container security tools okay we've all

543
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,039
heard of prismacloud the artist formerly

544
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,120
known as twistlock right

545
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
we all know prismacloud there's aqua

546
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
there's cis egg there's different

547
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
flavors

548
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
of container security

549
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,640
that do more

550
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,880
they actually restructure traffic

551
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
because then in your environments

552
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,160
if your traffic is structured everything

553
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,360
that is not what you know of is

554
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
something you need to analyze

555
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,720
some companies just do a default deny

556
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,200
hey you're not you're not on the mtls

557
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
port sorry you're gone

558
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
i'm gonna turn you off

559
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
so last thing is log analyzers

560
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,679
monitoring we all understand the

561
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,440
importance of monitoring we understand

562
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,799
the importance of looking at what these

563
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,080
logs do if you have an application that

564
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
does not create logs and there's some

565
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,640
legacy ones out there that don't

566
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,600
okay

567
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,320
you're in trouble

568
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,679
have a developer somewhere capture

569
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,919
events capture screen scrapes whatever

570
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,840
else and dump it to something that can

571
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,080
be read by something else

572
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,240
we all need that

573
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,400
why do we need that why do we need all

574
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,360
these native secures and these hardening

575
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,240
practices for our code and our testing

576
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,679
it's because

577
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
of these guys

578
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
look at them

579
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
shifty eyes

580
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,400
look how look how they're dressed

581
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,080
kind of funny but not real bad right

582
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,320
what's so different about these guys

583
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,799
they're standing at the door

584
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,640
okay first of all some of you guys look

585
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,600
really confused who knows what this is

586
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,919
wizard of oz okay all right

587
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,039
so you know the great thing about the

588
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
wizard of oz is it has tormented every

589
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,480
one of us every year when we were kids

590
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,840
because our mom is like it's a good

591
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
movie we need to watch it

592
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,280
right

593
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
but let's try and look at this on a

594
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,120
security mechanism let's put our

595
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
security glasses on

596
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,120
so the wizard of odd had two

597
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,919
defining quotes that everybody uses all

598
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,679
the time

599
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,039
i'm going to give you the first one the

600
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
first one is is there's no place like

601
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
home

602
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,080
right

603
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
remember to click the little ruby

604
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,120
slippers together i've tried it doesn't

605
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,159
work

606
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
right

607
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
what's the other quote

608
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,080
now before you call it out i just want

609
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
you to know the person that said these

610
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,080
are not the droids you're looking for

611
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
was carted out of here last night

612
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,320
right

613
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,879
you know what it is

614
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
that's true

615
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,360
yeah that's called security right

616
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,799
yeah pay no attention to the guy behind

617
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,760
the curtain

618
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,799
how about lions and tigers and bears

619
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,120
oh my that's right

620
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,679
why are that why is that important see

621
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,280
because when this movie was made back in

622
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,960
the 30s we were looking at the physical

623
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,600
level of danger

624
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
okay now we're looking at a different

625
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
level that comes into play with our

626
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,760
cloud and our security for our

627
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
applications

628
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,240
you want to know what that is

629
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,360
that's these guys

630
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,520
hackers employees and contractors or

631
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,559
consultants oh my

632
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
every one of us

633
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,600
have to worry about those guys

634
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,679
we know what a hacker is

635
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,720
okay

636
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,039
look around the room right now

637
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,000
you could be sitting right next to one

638
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,640
right we know what hackers are

639
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
we know what employees are

640
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
right

641
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,559
i don't know which one's scarier

642
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,440
and then we also know what the

643
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
consultants are what the consultants or

644
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
contractors do they come in they get an

645
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,240
awful lot of work done and then they go

646
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
away

647
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,280
right

648
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,039
they're security threats but what do we

649
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,039
have to look at these guys what do we

650
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,120
have to evaluate

651
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,440
with these different

652
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,360
types of people

653
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
and it's their intent

654
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,520
see application security takes security

655
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,320
into a different level than just applica

656
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,400
or then infrastructure

657
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
application security gets into the

658
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,280
mindset of

659
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
oh hey

660
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,320
what is their intent

661
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,960
what is the user's intent what is the

662
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,440
application's intent

663
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,760
right

664
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
what if it's this

665
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,360
what if it's malicious intent

666
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,840
that means willing to do some bad stuff

667
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,799
right

668
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
what about accidental

669
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,159
whoopsie i don't know

670
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,320
what if i know it's a security policy

671
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
but man that thing is a pain in my back

672
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
porch i want to get around that i'm just

673
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
going to go ahead and implement this

674
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
real quick and we're gone

675
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
we're here for the weekend all right

676
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,880
it happens

677
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,559
do you know why it happens it's because

678
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,720
we're human

679
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,320
now applications can do the same thing

680
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
see the before we were thinking that an

681
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
application is a program or a tool that

682
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,919
we use

683
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,520
not anymore

684
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,039
applications have something called

685
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,080
behavior and we're going to get into it

686
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,159
so the next one is this let's break this

687
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,080
down so on this picture that you're

688
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
taking a look at there's two constants

689
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,679
you know what the constants are

690
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,279
you see the malware

691
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,960
see a little down the bottom

692
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,799
you know for a fact

693
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,400
you're going to have malware trying to

694
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,480
get into your environment

695
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,360
you know it it's going to happen

696
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,440
but what's the other constant

697
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,000
the security gatekeeper that could be

698
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
you

699
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,559
that could be your department that could

700
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,880
be your company

701
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,799
but those are the two constants the

702
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
things that you can evaluate on a

703
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
regular basis

704
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,840
is those characters standing

705
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,919
there so look at look at the tin man

706
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,480
this guy just doesn't care

707
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,840
i don't care

708
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,039
he doesn't have a heart of course he

709
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,320
doesn't care

710
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
right i don't care

711
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,760
i don't care about the security i think

712
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,440
it's just a waste of time i'm gonna talk

713
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
smack about my security department all

714
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,799
the time because they're hindering me

715
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,720
getting my work done

716
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,279
it happens

717
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,679
what about sidestepping

718
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,159
outside of that classy snazzy suit

719
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,400
it's going around security going around

720
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,600
security because it's convenient for me

721
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
he's going around security because i

722
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
don't have to follow the rules because i

723
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,840
know what the risks are

724
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,200
right

725
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
i know

726
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
so what's the next step

727
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,960
how about going all the way down the end

728
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,080
to the uneducated

729
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,679
what does that mean

730
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
is there a no brain of course it's

731
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,120
uneducated

732
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,799
but what if you turn around and they say

733
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,159
well you know i got this really nice

734
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
email and it said that i won this

735
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
lottery number so i just clicked on it

736
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,559
i don't know why everybody in the

737
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,840
department's computers went out

738
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,720
it happens

739
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
it happens really bad see the other

740
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
thing is is you get fragmentation

741
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,360
grenades

742
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,720
do you know what fragmentation grenades

743
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,799
are so in the army navy air force

744
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,720
marines all those guys okay they have

745
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,840
these grenades and when they throw it

746
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
out it blows out all kinds of

747
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
metal shrapnel

748
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,559
ball bearings nails

749
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,360
okay

750
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,080
pictures of my mom terrible stuff

751
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,279
okay

752
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,279
but what happens with the fracture what

753
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,279
the fractional grenade is is that the

754
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
damage is widespread off of a single

755
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
user pulling that pin

756
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,360
so what's the volunteer the volatility

757
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,080
of that scenario it's the user again

758
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,679
what if it's an application and we start

759
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,279
receiving these fragment dates all the

760
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,120
time and suddenly you have a little

761
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
piece of code

762
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
that's undetectable

763
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,640
by your malware

764
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,840
and then you receive another one of

765
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,480
those and it adds to the first one

766
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,559
and then it adds to the second one and

767
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,400
eventually you're getting snippets until

768
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
eventually you have something that will

769
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,600
embed itself

770
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,159
into memory into a device

771
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,520
your printer

772
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,799
can hack your network

773
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,200
it happens

774
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,360
remember the news articles were that we

775
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,200
read here last few years where people

776
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,480
were driving down through neighborhoods

777
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,400
and they were using bluetooth to connect

778
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
to

779
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,440
grills

780
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,520
right hot tubs

781
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,039
and using that to hop into that you get

782
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,480
into your network and finding the guys

783
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
that had either a lots of money

784
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
okay or b

785
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,600
software from their company

786
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,960
and they look at it every time they plug

787
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
their home computer into it or their

788
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
laptop from work into it

789
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,559
where does the evil come from

790
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,559
you have to watch

791
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,480
so the last one in there is the good

792
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,960
employee how many know people know and

793
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,120
good good employees

794
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,159
just go ahead and raise your hand

795
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,159
i saw one hand over there and he only

796
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,080
went a little bit because he was still

797
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,720
wondering about it

798
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
you know what good employees are

799
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,279
they're rare

800
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,600
so out of all those people you see

801
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
okay there's only one of them that have

802
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,159
to be protected

803
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,200
right

804
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,559
that's the good employees the ones that

805
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,440
are actually getting the work done the

806
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,720
one that follow the rules the one that

807
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,679
are actually going after the

808
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,399
right way to do things

809
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,080
okay

810
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,960
so

811
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
remember i was talking before about how

812
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
applications

813
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,039
need to be treated as people

814
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,720
so look at that wheel

815
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,200
okay just to call out that i found this

816
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
on the internet and it was grievously

817
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
worked so i could use it in this

818
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,200
presentation

819
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,039
anybody know what the work term horked

820
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,039
means

821
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,440
he has been alive in the 70s

822
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,120
really dating myself here

823
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,279
okay we got one guy okay

824
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,159
so

825
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,640
when it's worked that means it's stolen

826
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
so yes i did it let's move on i'm

827
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,279
talking about security

828
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,679
so look at those wheels the people

829
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,840
authentication right

830
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,320
access control secondary approval

831
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,360
and user behavior

832
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
okay well this this isn't about the

833
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,880
users right

834
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
we're talking about application and

835
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,840
cloud

836
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,880
security so turn around and look at the

837
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
rest of those things well logging data

838
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,360
recovery right data classification

839
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,799
encryption key management then we get

840
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,039
into the infrastructure side that can be

841
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,520
configured inside of a

842
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,760
cloud

843
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,080
configuration hardly

844
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,399
and you know that's huge when people

845
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,000
accidentally don't configure their stuff

846
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,360
right and they get

847
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,240
hacked happens a lot

848
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,159
right logical segmentation and then

849
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,960
finally bound reinforcement

850
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,440
at your applications

851
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,399
need to live up to every one of those

852
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,840
so let's go back to people

853
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,559
authentication do you have your apis

854
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,320
authenticating to get from here to there

855
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
is your apis turning around and say hey

856
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,840
listen here's the credentials that i'm

857
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
bestowed here's the token

858
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
okay here's the certificate

859
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,880
i'm allowed to go through so i can

860
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,320
communicate with the databases in the

861
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,360
back or the legacy apps

862
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,440
or a third-party sas might need to query

863
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,480
me

864
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,159
is your application

865
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,159
authenticated

866
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,640
second one access control it's totally

867
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,559
based on the application it could be

868
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,279
based on geological geological

869
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,000
geo-referencing okay

870
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,919
so where is it at does it have does

871
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,080
something in st louis have the authority

872
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
to communicate with something in

873
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
chicago

874
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,000
how about dc

875
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,880
what are you doing with your

876
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
applications to define that

877
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
same thing when we start getting into

878
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,039
secondary approval

879
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,120
every time that your application

880
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,840
authenticates

881
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,440
somebody should be watching that

882
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,120
every time your application

883
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
reads from a database or writes to a

884
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,799
database

885
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,080
somebody should be watching that

886
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,240
right because what happens we start

887
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,399
building the last one there

888
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,159
behavior

889
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,720
analysis

890
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,360
so applications are designed by

891
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,880
patternization

892
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
meaning that if it's a daytime

893
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
application most of those applications

894
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,279
are going to be hit all the time during

895
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,720
the day between normal business hours

896
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,159
wait a minute somebody hit this thing in

897
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,320
one o'clock in the morning

898
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
so either ted is really burning the

899
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,600
midnight oil or that's kind of odd

900
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,880
well i don't want to deal with it i'm

901
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
going to sidestep it and it'll be funny

902
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,559
or do we turn around and we say hey

903
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,600
this behavior isn't right

904
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,679
so i don't care who's using the app but

905
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,279
the app itself is behaving differently

906
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,880
my network isn't right

907
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
i don't use it myself but

908
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,320
why is it doing that it's never done

909
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,279
that before that's odd

910
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,120
right

911
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,320
so that behavior analysis is everything

912
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
because now you're turning around and

913
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
saying hey i don't care about the people

914
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,880
using it

915
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
i care about the application that i

916
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,519
can't control

917
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,840
right

918
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,039
so

919
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,640
with that being said so that application

920
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,760
we're going to get into the last and

921
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,880
final world

922
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,919
and that is the instruction manual

923
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,000
the instruction manual is the security

924
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
policies the governance the compliance

925
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,480
the risk

926
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
because we don't have to think this up

927
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,760
on our own guys there's other people

928
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,720
that say hey industry-wise

929
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,159
according to iso 27k1

930
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,320
it says that these controls should be

931
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,799
followed

932
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,120
take the brain work out of it

933
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,720
what does that do to your organization

934
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,399
how are you using that

935
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,279
to affect your application so that they

936
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,919
are secure

937
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,080
frameworks the work is done

938
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,480
853 we're all familiar with nist

939
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,360
right

940
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,880
dfar is doing 171 for cui plus is it

941
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,679
classified done

942
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,279
confidential unclassified information

943
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,960
yeah something like that

944
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,039
right how about 190 we're looking at

945
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,120
containers somebody's already went

946
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,880
through this and taken a look at it the

947
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,960
nsa back in august released a document

948
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,360
on how to harden kubernetes

949
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,320
how many of you did that

950
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,159
see

951
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,679
the instruction manuals are there we

952
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,640
don't have to come up this on our own

953
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,720
the last thing on that is the governance

954
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
risk and compliance

955
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,720
who does governance when we're looking

956
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,039
right here it says governance

957
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,679
everybody assumes governance is what

958
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,200
governance is the well it's the

959
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,399
government

960
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,600
it's no

961
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,159
governance is your executive body your

962
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,000
management team's inside of your own

963
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,200
organization see compliance is what the

964
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,120
government throws on you or you need to

965
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,919
be socks hipaa pci

966
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,799
right

967
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,120
that's the compliance model

968
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,440
but governance is how are we using our

969
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,919
own security to protect our applications

970
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,760
and therefore our cloud

971
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,600
how are we doing it

972
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,519
the instructions are already there

973
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,600
because if we don't follow those

974
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
instructions

975
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,760
that middle word their risk

976
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,679
risk increases

977
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,919
by how we behave according to our

978
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,399
compliance models

979
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,640
if we don't care

980
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,799
either we'll hacker

981
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,600
right

982
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,120
either will the employee that says you

983
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,399
know i've been really down on my luck

984
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,760
and i met this guy at the bar and he

985
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
gave me ten thousand dollars to plug

986
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,760
this usb disk

987
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,560
stick oh man it was fantastic got a new

988
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,800
car

989
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,359
uh what wait i lost my job how my

990
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,000
company went under what happened

991
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
because we go back to that intent again

992
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,719
that human nature that people turning

993
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,960
around and trying to decide are they a

994
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,800
good employee

995
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,760
or are they not

996
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,839
we just have to figure that out so what

997
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,679
does grc look like this is what it looks

998
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,159
like

999
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,918
policy standard strategy risk controls

1000
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,239
incident how we handle them and also

1001
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,839
compliance

1002
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,560
technology is everything guys

1003
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,359
right

1004
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,719
that's what our job is

1005
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,879
information technology is the whole

1006
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,440
gamut but when we start breaking it down

1007
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,918
to the applications and how our cloud is

1008
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,800
going to respond to that security

1009
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,079
determines if we're going to be

1010
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,599
respectful

1011
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
and be able to make that company

1012
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,960
succeed

1013
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
it takes effort

1014
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
are you willing to do it

1015
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,839
so what i want you to do

1016
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,560
is i want you to look at this

1017
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,520
look where that finger's pointing

1018
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,759
right

1019
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,520
is it pointing at you

1020
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,720
probably not it's pointing at the guy

1021
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
next to you right

1022
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
but see what we have to realize is that

1023
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,079
we're all responsible for security

1024
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
if you look around the room we're here

1025
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,640
because we want to

1026
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,800
either a learn more

1027
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,760
or be

1028
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,720
validate what we already know

1029
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,640
so what are we going to do

1030
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
it's important to you

1031
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,480
to be able to do that

1032
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
so in conclusion i say thank you any

1033
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,598
questions

1034
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,400
nothing no questions i was that good

1035
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,760
what somebody said something about my

1036
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,599
family what

1037
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,440
okay we're ready for the beer

1038
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,480
all right we got one question

1039
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
in all honesty i think i mentioned it

1040
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,240
before i was dropped a lot as a child

1041
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
but at the same time when you turn

1042
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
around and you try to think of something

1043
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
that's innocent

1044
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,720
and you realize no matter how innocent

1045
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
it might be there's always teeth to it

1046
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
somewhere

1047
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
so with application and security you

1048
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,800
know we try to we

1049
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
we try to cover the basics that we're

1050
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,520
familiar with

1051
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,160
oh tcp port this thought and this other

1052
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,400
well that's infrastructure security when

1053
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
we start looking at other things

1054
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
in regards to security models we start

1055
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,079
thinking about

1056
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,240
uh username and password

1057
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,680
there's companies that don't even use

1058
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,280
username and password anymore it's the

1059
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
weakest form of authentication you can

1060
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,760
possibly have

1061
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
everybody knows mfa

1062
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,359
right mfa

1063
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,040
i receive something on my phone it's mfa

1064
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,400
does anybody actually know what that

1065
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,800
means it's the same two-factor

1066
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,359
authentication that we've had forever

1067
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,560
but what if we played some conditional

1068
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,800
uh roles on top of that

1069
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,240
so not only do you have to have a phone

1070
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,599
but you also have to be in the state of

1071
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,800
virginia to be able to log in

1072
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,880
so now we're going farther past that

1073
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
original debit card remember how we used

1074
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,599
to always use the debit card as an

1075
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,640
example

1076
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,400
you got the pin and you got the card

1077
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,440
that's two-factor authentication

1078
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,040
now there's three-factor authentication

1079
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,960
and four-factor authentication

1080
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
how secure are you

1081
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,960
there's one thing that governs all of it

1082
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,640
right

1083
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,920
we are going to get hacked unless we

1084
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,079
need more of this

1085
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,440
just like the previous speaker said you

1086
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
know when the budgets open up after

1087
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,720
you've been hacked

1088
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,480
right anybody ever been through a

1089
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
ransomware event

1090
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,079
so i've been with several customers on

1091
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,200
the radsmoor side and it's not pretty

1092
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,079
it's very expensive

1093
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,580
alright guys thank you so much

1094
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,270
[Applause]
