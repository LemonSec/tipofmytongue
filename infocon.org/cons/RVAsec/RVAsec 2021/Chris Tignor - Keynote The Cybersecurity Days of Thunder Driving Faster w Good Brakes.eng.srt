00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
let me just echo what jake said let's

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
definitely thank the uh the

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
vendors that are here and are sponsoring

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
this without them you know our ticket

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
prices would be a heck of a lot higher

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
and uh we probably actually wouldn't be

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
sitting here but thank you all for

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
coming out here so

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,640
when i was thinking about what do we

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
talk about today i actually took a step

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
back and thought

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,479
what are the questions that i'm asked

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,840
most often

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,280
as a cso

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
and these days in the last couple years

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,758
it's typically not security it's you

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,000
know how do i you know what are the

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,760
challenges we've got you know what are

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
your suggestions so

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
i thought kicking off this conference

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,720
what i do is leave you with a challenge

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,239
you know what's going to be your

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,800
challenge to think about over these next

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
couple days over the experiences we've

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,840
all been through as a as a global

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,599
citizen in the last couple years through

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,239
this crazy thing called covid so you

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,440
know let's look back at at 2021.

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
um

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
it's really hard to believe

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,720
you know that we have been in this

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,000
pandemic state now for almost two years

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
i

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
you know was one of the lucky recipients

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,239
of a uh job loss due to covid you know

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,599
when you're in the consulting business

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,120
and you're working with hospitality

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
firms and they lay off 95 percent of

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,560
their workers guess where their

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
consultants go to

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,440
um so you know 2021's been a crazy year

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,159
with we've got covid going on

84
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,000
you know who in the world would have

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
ever thought you know we would be

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,319
fighting over toilet paper

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,920
um

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
you know

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
i can't say walmart is one of my

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,879
favorite places on earth even even

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,319
before covid

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,560
but you know oddest experience i'm

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
pushing a cart through walmart and a

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,239
walmart worker just comes over and

95
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,879
but thank you

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,840
you know

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
just really odd so i mean you know we've

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,280
got microchip shortages we've got

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,239
all sorts of wild wacky things going on

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
hurricanes tornadoes flooding

105
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
you know suddenly we're working from

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
home

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
oh yeah you didn't have enough to do

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
with working now we're virtual schooling

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,239
people can't figure out how to zoom blue

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,519
jeans

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
chime

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
you know webex whatever it is they can't

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,959
figure it out and then you add the

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
security challenges too if you haven't

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,799
been zoom bombed i must tell you have

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,000
missed out on some great experiences

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,478
um wow i just have to say there's

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,560
nothing like someone

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
zoom bombing a meeting particularly if

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
it's on a security topic and you realize

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
whoever hosted it didn't set up a

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
password that's

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
brilliant

124
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
um

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,320
you know and and suddenly i had believe

126
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
it or not those of you know me from

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
years ago will really think gosh she's

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,759
really lying here i have become a gym

129
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,720
rat

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,320
actually and we'll talk a little bit

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,759
more about that later

132
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,720
but

133
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,440
i really went through

134
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
it was like i was coming off of crack or

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
something

136
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,759
not being able to go to the gym

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,199
you know and then i don't have any hair

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
to cut anyway but those who you know did

139
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,720
need their haircut my son was looking

140
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
more like a shaggy dog than a teenager

141
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
so that was a bit crazy my wife uh

142
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,199
attempted to cut his hair he will never

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,280
let that happen again

144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,039
uh you know then we're still trying to

145
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,759
figure out this mask thing um are we

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
supposed to wear them are we not or

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
you know

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
it's so hard to tell i am i personally

149
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
being being high risk with type 2

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,479
diabetes i've already had my booster you

151
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
know so i'm more concerned about those

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
around me and like geez

153
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,039
i'm probably not going to have this but

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,600
if i do have it maybe i'm the silent

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
carrier so i better wear a mask so i

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
don't give it to someone else

157
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,199
but uh you know it's so much confusing

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,039
information out there and being sort of

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,520
a data guru you know

160
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
i've learned over the years that you can

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
take a set of data and you can twist it

162
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
to almost tell any story you want do the

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
masks work well let me look at the mass

164
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
data and i'll tell you how likely you

165
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
are to get ransomware what

166
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
it

167
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,560
you know

168
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,800
it's a crazy world out there you know

169
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,960
speaking of which we've got you know

170
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,000
malware we've got ransomware

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,319
we've got data breaches we've got

172
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,919
general hacks

173
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
you know and oh yeah gartner is really

174
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,360
labeled this year is the year of the

175
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
great resignation you know people have

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
really thought through

177
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,400
do i really want to keep doing what i'm

178
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
doing maybe it's time for chris 2.0

179
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,319
what's something different

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,280
i've been working at home

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
i don't really like it i love it my

182
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,039
company is going to make me go back in

183
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
the office they're going to make me stay

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,080
at home

185
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
i just want something new

186
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
so you know the estimate this year i

187
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,199
think from gartner is 25 to 30 percent

188
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,840
of the i.t workforce will actually

189
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,160
voluntarily resign

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,319
and go somewhere else

191
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
and for once the primary reason is

192
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
actually not an increase in pay

193
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,919
it's just different working conditions

194
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,759
and it's funny looking at some of the

195
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
surveys and just having read a gardener

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
white paper on this last night

197
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,919
a lot of it is

198
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,560
they just want something different

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,199
and in some cases it's very minor

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
the reasons that they want it's things

201
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
from i don't always want to work from

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,240
home or i do always want to work from

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,039
home

204
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,880
or

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
i only have a 22-inch monitor and i'd

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,039
really like a 32-inch monitor

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
really

208
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,280
wow

209
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,080
um

210
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
you know

211
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
we'll talk more about that but you know

212
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
then we look at

213
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
okay gosh

214
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
i've got to worry about people resigning

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
but at the same time wow i can't even

216
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
staff the positions that i've got now

217
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,120
how do i find employees how do i find

218
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,680
consultants how do i find contractors so

219
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
we've got that going on then you add

220
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,400
some election craziness and

221
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
no matter if you're

222
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
communist socialist democrat republican

223
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,599
libertarian insane whatever your party

224
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,400
is

225
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
you know it's a little nuts um people

226
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,280
have just gone overboard frankly in

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
every party out there

228
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,639
um and then you know we're just at this

229
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,919
point where it's like we're trying to

230
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,639
balance 15 things at once so what do i

231
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
hear the most about is just sort of this

232
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,400
whole set of this is just maddening you

233
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
know i'm just to the point of total

234
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
overwhelm

235
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
how on earth do i actually handle all of

236
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,879
this

237
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,400
and so i thought what we'd talk about

238
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
today is you know

239
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,479
how do i actually survive all this how

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,519
do we

241
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,200
keep moving forward how do i keep my

242
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
career moving forward how do i keep my

243
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,599
family

244
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,440
well i would say saying mine is already

245
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,958
beyond that point so you know just how

246
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,880
do i sort of

247
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
settle them down keep them you know

248
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,440
intact um but then you know what do i do

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,600
so i thought you know what maybe we

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
should talk today about you know what do

251
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
we need to take care of

252
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
so i'm going to leave a few challenges

253
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
and kind of hit on five areas of things

254
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
i think

255
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
we should just think about and talk

256
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,000
about based upon experiences i think

257
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
we've all had but you know i'll

258
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
highlight a few you know

259
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
the five things i want to talk about

260
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
today are you know taking care of your

261
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
team

262
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
wherever you work

263
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,279
taking care of your community you know

264
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,760
we we all live on this planet

265
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,519
we all have different views different

266
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
experiences different beliefs but we all

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
share one thing in common

268
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,839
we're here living together we need to

269
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
take care of each other

270
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
and then your colleagues in the

271
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
technology and security community what

272
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,399
can we do to help each other

273
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,519
you know

274
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,440
richmond is a great town i love it um

275
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,519
it's not huge you know what do we often

276
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,320
do

277
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,360
uh as security leaders

278
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,959
whose gem got over there working from

279
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
him that i could poach

280
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
uh well i've pissed him off so i can't

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,040
go out to lunch with him after i stole

282
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,160
those two employees so

283
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,560
look who's working for renee

284
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
let me hire her

285
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,839
you know this thing of just you know

286
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,240
poaching and and that you know there's

287
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
definitely

288
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,600
gonna happen but there's definitely

289
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
better ways we can work with our

290
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
colleagues and help out in the security

291
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,079
community help our pipeline of of people

292
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,760
that we want to employ

293
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,000
you know other than colleagues you know

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you've got to take care of yourself too

295
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,519
you know i always

296
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
one of my mottos out of a book i read

297
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
one time is you know it's not about me

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
it's not about me but you do need to

299
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
take care of your career you do need to

300
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880

301
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
don't have your health you don't have

302
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
anything quite frankly

303
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
so

304
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
we take these you know kind of one at a

305
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,079
time you know what what do we need to do

306
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,519
with our teams

307
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,399
sometimes we think okay you know let me

308
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,079

309
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,720

we're all good

312
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,800
well yes but looking at some of the the

313
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
human engagement surveys that are out

314
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,760
there from

315
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,839
gartner from forester

316
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,760
you know people just really want some

317
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
simple things out there you know is

318
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,279
someone just going to take the time to

319
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,800
listen to me

320
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,680
just

321
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,399
not

322
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,240
yeah yeah i hear you

323
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,399
but just actively listening of

324
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
what you know what's on your mind

325
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
okay

326
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
yeah

327
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
really

328
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
your main concern today is

329
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,959
and i'm serious when i say this

330
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,560
your family's running low on toilet

331
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,079
paper you know you can't

332
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,079
well you know the funny thing is

333
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,399
if the human the basic human needs

334
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,560
aren't met how do you expect people to

335
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
focus on

336
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
taking care of tuning the intrusion

337
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
prevention system or

338
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,160
figuring out hey

339
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,079
what's my threat in our cloud

340
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,959
environment so sometimes it's just the

341
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,839
basic needs just sitting down listening

342
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,880
you know i start my day out every day

343
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,639
it's kind of odd you know in my my

344
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,720
little basement office

345
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
of just videoing and checking on my uh

346
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,760
employees you know hey team how's it

347
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
going you know we have a 10-minute stand

348
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
up and

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
rarely

350
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,639
rarely do we actually talk about work

351
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,839
it's more of

352
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,279
okay chris what's going on in austin you

353
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,200
know and often it was phoning him on the

354
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
uh he's in austin so he lived for about

355
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,040
a week without power no heat

356
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,720
and this is a guy who decided i don't

357
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
need a car i can live on a motorcycle

358
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,480
so well all of his neighbors were out

359
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,639
sleeping in their heated cars he was

360
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,880
sleeping on the cold floor and he's flat

361
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,160
in austin because sleeping on a

362
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
motorcycle isn't too comfortable

363
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,800
but just listening to him figuring out

364
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
hey what do you need what can we get you

365
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
and strange enough

366
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
clean drinking water was a problem

367
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,880
so literally

368
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
amazon to the rescue

369
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
we just sent in a case of drinking water

370
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
and he was like you know the happiest

371
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
employee ever but

372
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,440
you know beyond listening you know just

373
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
thanking people for doing their job you

374
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
know we all have in the security in the

375
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,880
i.t realm there's those exciting

376
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,959
projects that are fun to do that are

377
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
challenging

378
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
at the same time you know

379
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
they're often the ones they get all the

380
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
praise they're the heroes oh thank you

381
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
for implementing

382
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
whatever you did

383
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
while at the same time we've got other

384
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,279
people who are just running the engine

385
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
you know which is no less important

386
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,320
and sometimes just a simple thank you of

387
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
hey thanks for tuning those alerts

388
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,240
coming in and weeding that stuff out you

389
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
saved a lot of time you know i know

390
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
you're working an exorbitant amount of

391
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,560
hours but thank you for doing that

392
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,760
you know just sharing that thank you

393
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,839
another thing i found during covid

394
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,720
that you know just be understanding of

395
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
people

396
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
you know this isn't a facebook like or

397
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,519
anything but you know just

398
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,920
be understanding of people find out hey

399
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,480
okay yep your kids are home i don't care

400
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,800
that there's noise in the background

401
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
you know that's okay

402
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,920
why do you think i'm locked in the

403
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
basement all hell is breaking loose

404
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,920
upstairs in my house

405
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
there's a bit of noise that's quite okay

406
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
you need to take an hour in the

407
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
afternoon to go drop your kids off it's

408
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,120
uh at skating pick them up from school

409
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,920
that's fine you know we're flexible

410
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
not many of us are in eight to five or

411
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
nine to five

412
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
hours that you know we're clocking in

413
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
and clocking out

414
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
some maybe are but where we can be that

415
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
understanding and flexibility

416
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,920
i think the other thing that i found

417
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,040
interesting

418
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,839
is that in some areas

419
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,519
looking at some of the the gartner data

420
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,279
and i'm not selling gartner memberships

421
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
or have any stock in them maybe i should

422
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,399
but

423
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,839
one of the things

424
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,079
that was a theme was people don't feel

425
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,000
like they're being stretched

426
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,959
that

427
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,079
all focus on covid has been

428
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,680
let's get things up and running let's

429
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,519
not change anything let's make sure

430
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,720
we're

431
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,399
running a remote environment and it's

432
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,440
secure

433
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,680
shut everything else down so we've got

434
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,079
some people who are just flat out board

435
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,240
and that was actually about 50 of the

436
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
people that were looking to resign

437
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,639
this coming year is that they didn't

438
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
feel like they had a challenge

439
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,760
so you know i think there's a lot of

440
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
opportunities even if our companies

441
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,639
aren't

442
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,000
stretching people

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
maybe stretch them to

444
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
you know learn more to volunteer some

445
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,079
time

446
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,800
to do things in an area that they're

447
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
interested in but maybe the company

448
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,040
isn't ready to take on so there's plenty

449
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
of those opportunities out there

450
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,000
and then we certainly can't

451
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
ever talk about a team without talking

452
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,759
about money

453
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,839
i think it's always a good opportunity

454
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,959
if you can and you have the hr support

455
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,120
to do it i'm thankful that i do

456
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
to actually do some proactive

457
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,000
compensation reviews just to take a look

458
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,120
at

459
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
you know

460
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,079
hey are we you know are we paying you

461
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,720
what the market is paying you know and

462
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,959
and sometimes we're not and sometimes we

463
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,600
just need to i think be transparent with

464
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
their employees and and tell them

465
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,399
hey look the market's made x percent

466
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,880
jump this year you know

467
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,639
hey here's what we can do to try to get

468
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,440
you closer to that and share with them

469
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,519
one of the benefits of staying and you

470
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,880
know and support them one way or the

471
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
other hopefully you can have that open

472
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,040
honest conversation

473
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
with them but i think being proactive

474
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the cost of recruiting someone now just

475
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
from your own time

476
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,440
is incredible

477
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000
going through building a team myself

478
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
the amount of hours you have to pour

479
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,440
into

480
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,279
recruiting especially trying to steal

481
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,920
team members from gem over here you know

482
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
good at holding on to people

483
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,959
joking

484
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,759
um you know it's a lot of time it's a

485
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
lot of money that goes into it so you

486
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
know

487
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,480
sharing with hr

488
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
hey you know if these people leave

489
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,759
you're going to have to hire more

490
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,120
recruiters you're going to have to pay

491
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,040
more head hunting firms

492
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,400
you know

493
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
is it worth you know bumping their

494
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,760
salary by five thousand dollars or

495
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
when he walks out the door for five

496
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,679
thousand dollars more let's pay 25 000

497
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,439
to refill

498
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,359
that spot and then go through training

499
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
the person so that they can leave a year

500
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,720
from now too

501
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,119
so uh for me that's been a successful

502
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,439
conversation but i'd encourage you just

503
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,760
you know think about that uh approach

504
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,559
and help support your team

505
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,720
you know a big thing for me and jake

506
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,799
mentioned it who's up here is you know

507
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
community

508
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,120
we all live and work in a great town

509
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,200
but it really does take the whole

510
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
community to take care of itself and you

511
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,080
know i'm at pra group now you know and

512
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,440
people like what is that i'm like well

513
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
it's a non-performing loan

514
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,880
um company where we go and buy

515
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
loans that people have not been paying

516
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,360
on from you know

517
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
credit card companies banks

518
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
typically non-secured debt

519
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
so hopefully none of you are customers

520
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,760
of ours

521
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
in the room but you know it

522
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
i never thought

523
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,880
that i would ever be in this industry

524
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,320
but i was actually attracted to the

525
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,520
company because it started 25 years ago

526
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,200
with the founder saying

527
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
you know there's a better way

528
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,160
we are all going to fall upon hard times

529
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,120
where we're going to be out of job

530
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
our income is going to be reduced either

531
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,320
through

532
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,280
divorce through a job loss through

533
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,799
medical emergency and so forth

534
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,640
people should be treated with dignity

535
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
and we should help people

536
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,720
pay this off negotiate with them and get

537
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
a plan in place so

538
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,240
pra was one of the first to actually

539
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
offer plans of up to five years to pay

540
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
something with like minimum payments of

541
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,200
like five dollars now still it's not a

542
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,039
sexy industry you know but i think it

543
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,760
was a good example for me of

544
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,320
wow we can give back we can help put

545
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,440
teeth in

546
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,120
in the financial services industry

547
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
because if someone wasn't collecting on

548
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
this everyone would just be taking out

549
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,720
credit cards and never paying them off

550
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,600
and thinking who cares

551
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
pay a couple bucks have a bankruptcy

552
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
write it off and start over with some

553
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
more

554
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,960
credit cards you don't pay but one of

555
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,000
the things that that pra definitely

556
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
was in sync

557
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
for me and i liked was

558
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,280
hey let's get out there and make this a

559
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,679
better world so for me you know i think

560
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,120
we need to make sure we're taking care

561
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
of our community

562
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,679
you know there's some awesome

563
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
opportunities to get out and

564
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,360
volunteer

565
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
and

566
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
not going to knock any organization if

567
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,039
your way of getting rid of stress and we

568
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
your way of giving back

569
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
is going out there and hammering some

570
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,520
nails in for habitat for humanity

571
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,919
awesome do that

572
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
there's a lot of people like no my thing

573
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
is i really want to be behind this

574
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
keyboard

575
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,120
i blow off steam by gaming at night now

576
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
that's my son

577
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,120
you know and i actually have glanced

578
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
down the clock a few times and thinking

579
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
about him he's a freshman in college

580
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,799
he's majoring in unmanned aerial systems

581
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,520
kind of funny didn't even exist when i

582
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,400
was

583
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,480
uh he's doing a presentation this

584
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
morning and of course

585
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
i didn't suggest it to him but it's kind

586
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
of interesting the influence i guess my

587
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
career has had on him i'm like oh so

588
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,320
what's your presentation on he's like oh

589
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,400
i'm talking about these two competing

590
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
chinese air drone light shows that took

591
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,440
place in china i'm like

592
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
okay what are you talking about

593
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,280
well each show attempted to hack the

594
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,840
other

595
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
and and one of the shows

596
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
actually uh someone uh took a simple

597
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
almost like amazon type device and did

598
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
uh radio frequency jamming and crashed

599
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
over 500 of the drones in one of the air

600
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
shows

601
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,039
so it was funny the other show's group

602
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,280
then apparently

603
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,799
hacked and took all of the bitcoin

604
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,440
profit from the other

605
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
but but that was his presentation this

606
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,400
morning so he's uh he was prepping for

607
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,919
that last night and was nervous this

608
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
morning so he should be done in about 10

609
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,320
minutes i think so we'll see how he did

610
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,679
but it's really cool you know so

611
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,520
there's so many things we can volunteer

612
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,200
for one of the things i learned when i

613
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
was at impact makers

614
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
was there's a lot of non-profits out

615
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
there that really need some i.t help

616
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,320

shirts here today for volunteering and

621
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
helping with rva sec

622
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
you know

623
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
if you've got someone

624
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,679
you know who's a friend over at dcu or u

625
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,320
of r hey i don't know what i want to do

626
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
get him to volunteer most of the

627
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
universities now require some kind of

628
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
community service

629
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,039
hours

630
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,039
bring them in here

631
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,440
look out at places like

632
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
one place i volunteered as i.t for

633
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,200
causes you know

634
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
what did i do

635
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,200
i actually helped administer security

636
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,760
awareness training for some local uh

637
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
non-profits some of these you know 10 12

638
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,799
employees helping set up no before

639
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,280
or wombat security training proof point

640
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
i guess now

641
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,039
helping administer for those and just

642
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,280
helping out so you probably don't want

643
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
me using a nail gun out there helping

644
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,200
build a house if you want to live in it

645
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,679
but i'm probably okay administering

646
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,039
security awareness training so just

647
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
think about how can i

648
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
how can i give back

649
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
the other thing

650
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,280
that i really think is you know

651
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,400
mentoring you know regardless if you've

652
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
got a year of experience

653
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,880
for decades

654
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
you know i can really date myself here

655
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,600
but there is someone out there who could

656
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,320
learn from your experience

657
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,880
hey how did you find that first job you

658
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
know what classes do you recommend i

659
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
take in college

660
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
should i go straight in and get my

661
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,320
graduate degree should i get a job first

662
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,480
you know my motto is

663
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,400
masters are expensive let a company pay

664
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
for that versus paying for it yourself

665
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,200
but you know if you've got that money

666
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,960
tree growing in the backyard you go for

667
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,400
it

668
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
you know on that note you know are there

669
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,000
opportunities to actually teach

670
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,840
i you know

671
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,799
go up

672
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,159
usually twice a semester to jmu and just

673
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,000
voluntarily teach

674
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,760
a class and the topic varies it's

675
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,720
usually something in it consulting or

676
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,559
usually in the security risk management

677
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,919
space

678
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,480
to spend about half of the time talking

679
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,559
and then the other half just

680
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,080
answering questions

681
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
and you know in many cases

682
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,880
just trying to ditch the podium take the

683
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,240
mic and just sit on the side of the

684
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
stage and just talk and find out hey

685
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
what do you need help in

686
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,360
and

687
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,919
you know connecting people together big

688
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,200
theme of mine

689
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,400
is always

690
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,159
whether it's work or whether it's with

691
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,320
people it's connecting dots and it's

692
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,760
figuring out okay

693
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,520

694
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,440
potential solutions how do i connect

695
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,880
those together

696
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
and i think

697
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,080

great places to donate you know i'm

always a big

715
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,000
fan of donating time but a thing i've

716
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,360
certainly found in this pandemic

717
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,120
is a huge supporter of local food banks

718
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,279
this pandemic has hit people

719
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,679
that even executives i mean if you watch

720
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,080
the national news local news

721
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
seeing people lining up for food because

722
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,159
all of a sudden their company

723
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,440
disappeared

724
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,400
overnight and they didn't have food so

725
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,760
i think you know this is taking care of

726
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,320
your community the

727
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,600

me or bottles right now when i say this

748
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,520
but

749
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,240
there's nothing like free consulting

750
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,720
with your with your colleagues you know

751
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
talk to people

752
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,679
about these things how can

753
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,760
people help each other

754
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,919
from lessons learned talk to the vendors

755
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,600
that are here i look at them as real

756
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,880
partners

757
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,159
you know often some of the best

758
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,080
recommendations i've come across for

759
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
fixing a solution

760
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
has come from a vendor and it's not even

761
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,919
a product or service they sell but it's

762
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,919
like hey you know here's an idea let me

763
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,400
connect you with this person so don't

764
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
forget those

765
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
you know pull together in in these local

766
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
support groups we've got rva sec we've

767
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,279
got different virginia security groups

768
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,200
some most of them are free some of them

769
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,520
are paid if you don't have one maybe

770
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
consider forming one within your own

771
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,039
company you know some of the larger

772
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,200
organizations around town federal

773
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
reserve for example

774
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
has their own internal security

775
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,320
community that pulls together

776
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,279
on a

777
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,279
set schedule of hey how can we share

778
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,080
things across our 12 districts

779
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
you know and supporting your team and

780
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
actually doing those many of these

781
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
things now are virtual

782
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
so it doesn't take a dime of travel

783
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
money

784
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,200
it doesn't take much and actually

785
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
signing up for these things but then you

786
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,760
know the other thing too

787
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
people are tired of being at home

788
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,120
um

789
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,440
i you know if i stare at one more screen

790
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,120
sometimes during the day i feel like i'm

791
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,039
going to flip a lid

792
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,480
so it's like hey

793
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,919
you know are you comfortable you know

794
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,200

heads

798

because we had some employees that my

799
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,039

841
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
i guess it was my neighbor's

842
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,679
uncle ended up being the assistant dean

843
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,320
of the college of business at jmu so he

844
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,120
just sort of felt obligated to take this

845
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,279
poor country kid and take him under his

846
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,200
wing you know one of the things he told

847
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,919
me

848
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,279
i remember two things actually one was

849
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,360
don't go straight to graduate school get

850
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,039
out there and learn something these kids

851
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,640
who come straight into graduate school

852
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,600
can't apply diddly squat

853
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,320
that was his technical term and then the

854
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,440
second

855
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,039
thing that he shared was

856
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,600
find a mentor

857
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,919
always have a mentor until the day you

858
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,039
die

859
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:57,840
and

860
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,200
i hate to say it this guy was close to

861
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,440
his deathbed anyway he still had a

862
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,559
mentor

863
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,000
and that mentor

864
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,080
isn't necessarily always someone older

865
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,679
than you but it's you know you can learn

866
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,919
so i have a couple actually

867
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,880
and

868
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,039
you know and one in the the security

869
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,880
risk space and one in sort of just the

870
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
leadership space

871
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
and they make huge differences when you

872
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,640
need to go through major life changes of

873
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,399
whoa

874
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,240
we're now an empty nester

875
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,720
you know we need to downsize

876
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,240
what do i want to do where do we want to

877
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,919
go

878
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,520
or you're going through

879
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,880
holy crap

880
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,760
you know my job is going to disappear

881
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,279
half of this company this team i'm

882
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,039
leading is going to go away

883
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,559
because the industry we're serving is

884
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,360
temporarily shut down due to a pandemic

885
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
it's great to have those mentors you

886
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,799
know in addition to being one i highly

887
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,360
encourage finding one

888
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,679
and they change over time too i will

889
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,399
tell you that from my own experience but

890
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,080
you know when you're taking care of your

891
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,840
look at different paths think about

892
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,080
different things i mean

893
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,840
you know people ask me all the time

894
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,880
why did you go from leading a team of

895
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,880
200 to temporarily leading a team of 700

896
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,120
to 100 and now you're leading a team of

897
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,480
uh of two dozen like you know

898
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
your preferences

899
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,880
your strengths they change over time

900
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
you have different priorities in life

901
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,960
and so for me

902
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,279
my job that i have now for me

903
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,600
is absolutely fantastic

904
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,559
because

905
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,519
i get to keep my hands in the tech

906
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,399
it's not a 25 hour day eight day a week

907
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,200
job i can spend time in the community i

908
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,760
can give back i can actually find some

909
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,279
time for networking jake and i were

910
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,559
joking this morning

911
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,240
i'm like jake i've actually got some

912
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,399
time now to participate in stuff i can

913
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,880
do stuff it's like yeah yeah tigner

914
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
you've been telling me that for 10 years

915
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,399
and this is the first time i can get you

916
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,320
to this conference and it dawned upon me

917
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,320
jake by the way i just realized

918
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,720
so i hopefully will be at the omni next

919
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,840
year

920
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,320
because this conference always falls on

921
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,720
my wedding anniversary

922
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,200
so i can think of at least

923
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,880
10 of the nine years

924
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,559
why i wasn't here

925
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,240
for that but if we're the only next year

926
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,200
my wife will actually be here so

927
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,799
but i'll commit now to jake that i'll be

928
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,679
here

929
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,840
but you know think about different

930
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,159
things expanding your scope so one of

931
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,640
the cool things

932
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,919
you know

933
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,840
i'm stretching myself this year i signed

934
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,399
up to be an executive sponsor

935
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,159
at pra for

936
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,679
emotional wellness

937
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,679
helping people to take care of

938
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,039
themselves

939
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,960
emotionally mentally

940
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,120
it's so important you know thinking

941
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,200
differently doing something different

942
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,399
you know

943
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,159
use this opportunity to go out there and

944
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,320
retool yourself you know whether you're

945
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,600
technical or not there are so

946
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,799
many opportunities inexpensive free ones

947
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,640
out there to take training

948
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,200
right now to get some help to

949
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,240
you know take a class virtually to

950
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,159
many now even in person if you're

951
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,080
comfortable doing that there are some

952
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,399
that are extremely inexpensive if not

953
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,559
free where they're just trying to get

954
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,279
you know butts and seats to actually say

955
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,279
hey we've got you know an in-person

956
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,120
presence here so think about those

957
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,360
things you know and

958
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,039
it wouldn't be chris saying something if

959
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,720
i didn't put in here this connect piece

960
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,600
you know connect with other people

961
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,519
see what they've got you know we are a

962
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,000
small town again we're you know i'm on

963
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,840
my

964
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,039
anti-poach thing not because i'm trying

965
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,679
to uh to protect any of my employees i

966
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,279
literally have one richmond employee the

967
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,600
rest are spread between oslo and

968
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,279
jerusalem and austin and knoxville but

969
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,159
you know

970
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
how do we connect

971
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,640
and and help each other out here both

972
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,279
personal and professional

973
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,960
and then the other thing is

974
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,919
um you know this isn't uh my son was

975

you know there's so many great podcasts

980
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,760
out there

981
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,918
there's it's information overload for

982
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,520
sure but find something make it a habit

983
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
you know

984
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,040

985
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,119
anything

986
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,280
one of the things i miss the most about

987
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,800
not going to the office is whoa wait a

988

hmm

1025
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,680
you know so a personal story that

1026
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,599
several of you in here can personally uh

1027
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,599
relate because we work together

1028
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,440
i allowed myself to take on an interim

1029
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
senior executive role

1030
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
leading a massive

1031
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,599
organization and was traveling literally

1032
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,720
six days a week for about 15 months

1033
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,440
straight and i was telling renee earlier

1034
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,119
before we started

1035
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,599
i get a call from my doctor he's like

1036
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,440
are you in bed are you okay how are you

1037
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,880
chris i'm like

1038
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,400
no i'm actually standing in my office

1039
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,760
walking around looking at downtown

1040
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,720
richmond

1041
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,240
on it's like go to the er like what

1042
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,040
your blood sugar is so high

1043
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,359
that you should not actually be humanly

1044
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,440
functioning right now

1045
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,400
so you know it's strange that i you know

1046
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,040
was in richmond that day because i

1047
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,280
literally had been on the road for about

1048
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
14 months straight

1049
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,760
and so instantly i was put on insulin

1050
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,520
you know insulin is great at controlling

1051
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,920
blood sugar it also sucks out every

1052
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,839
calorie out of the universe and puts it

1053
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,480
right on your stomach and thighs

1054
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,960
so weight shot up

1055
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,480
so literally

1056
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,520
i

1057
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,640
my life turned upside down and i

1058
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
ultimately learned wait a minute i've

1059
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,480
got to take control of this

1060
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,040
i got a personal trainer i dropped 50

1061
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,560
pounds

1062
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,599
you know

1063
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,760
kovit has kind of slowed that decline

1064
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
down a bit but

1065
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
you know my wife's not too happy that

1066
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
i've got my uh treadmill taking up half

1067
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,119
the garage but it's gonna stay i'll park

1068
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,160
outside

1069
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,040
you know

1070
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,720
really learn you've got to take care of

1071
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,560
yourself you know are you doing those

1072
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
things of you know relaxation and

1073
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,240
mindfulness meditation prayer whatever

1074
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,119
your thing is find something

1075
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,359
that you can take care of yourself

1076
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,079
i find that so many times people are

1077
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,000
taking care of one

1078
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,079
but not the other you know maybe that

1079
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,240
gym rat but they're stressed out to the

1080
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,200
point that

1081
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,359
well i'm okay i've only had 32 pots of

1082
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,079
coffee today chris no

1083
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,720
you know let's you know you need to do

1084
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,800
something to relax you know whether

1085
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,560
that's exercise whether that's mental uh

1086
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,480
mindfulness or whatever you've got to

1087
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,920
take care of yourself in order to be

1088
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,400
able to take care of those around you so

1089
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,440
you know

1090
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,280
we will wind up

1091
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,440
here early but you know let's talk about

1092
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
what's the challenge i leave you with

1093
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,880
today it's really five pieces you know

1094
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,680
how do i leave here

1095
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,200
and take care of

1096
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,960
my team

1097
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,320
my community

1098
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,400
the colleagues that i've got

1099
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,640
my career and my health those are really

1100
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
challenging things particularly i think

1101
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,040
covet has brought to mind for a lot of

1102
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,599
people where we often have a lot more

1103
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,560
time

1104
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,119
to ourselves particularly when the when

1105
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,960
the zoom call is over

1106
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,359
what do i need to do how can i get back

1107
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,040
how can i make a difference so

1108
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,880
with that i think

1109
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
it's about five of the hour

1110
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,640
what i want to do is give you the extra

1111
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,000
time back if there's any questions glad

1112
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,520
to answer but

1113
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,440
i really want to give us that extra time

1114
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,200
to spend with these vendors that i

1115
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,440
cannot thank them enough for coming in

1116
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,000
here and sponsoring their key reason

1117
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
that we're here

1118
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,079
as much as we hate those cold call sales

1119
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,680
and as many of those numbers that i have

1120
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,760
actually blocked on my phone

1121
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,359
uh

1122
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,960
you know

1123
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,480
jake could probably code the stuff

1124
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,880
himself so you know i'll give

1125
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,359
jake and suloa

1126
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,720
a pass here

1127
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,560
those like myself you don't want me

1128
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,160
coding the stuff i need to buy it from

1129
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,400
someone i need them to help me in that

1130
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,000
journey so we're going to take this

1131
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,839
extra time and and spend with those

1132
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,119
vendors so

1133
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,720
let me ask any questions anything

1134
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,400
awesome well with that i think we're

1135
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,960
going to have a break from now until

1136
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
bottom of the hour

1137
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,280
10 30. so spend that time

1139
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,000
