1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,880
just want to say thank you to everyone

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,480
for coming today

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,400
i know with the current environment it's

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,519
a little difficult to get out there um

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,160
as always great crowd here

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,080
so what do you guys think about why i

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,159
love purple teaming even though they

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,680
don't exist

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,160
a little clickbaity huh

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
yeah

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,079
did you fall for the click bait or

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,840
what do you think okay

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
um so one of the questions i have is

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,399
you know purple teaming's really kind of

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,239
hit the industry for cyber security

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,440
recently

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
um it's a terminology that's out there

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
that's not quite really defined very

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,680
well

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,399
is anyone in here on a purple team or

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
what they consider to be a purple team

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,920
no all right see i told you they don't

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,040
exist

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
because no one here is on one

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
uh so kind of today walk you through um

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
about this evolution of where where

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
i discovered with purple teams

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
and i'm going to spend a little bit of

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,439
time on my story because i think it

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,759
gives you the background

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,960
of

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,320
the purple teaming the story i'm going

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,159
to tell so

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,159
if you're looking i do have to apologize

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,680
you can put in the comments if you're

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,520
looking for some slides today to kind of

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,079
take away and go apply something

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,640
this is more about challenging ideas and

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
talking about concepts and how we define

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,960
things and whereas we we as an industry

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
can go

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,840
to find some answers or solutions

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
all right uh so my story who am i right

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,000
you see a lot of certifications up there

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,399
um i've been through the cybersecurity

46
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,360
training

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,680
um i do

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
penetration testing

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
keep that quiet there because once you

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,000
say that you are labeled as that for

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,318
life and nobody will look you look at

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,599
you the same

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,160
so i prefer the purveyor of cyber

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
security

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
says we do a lot more

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
than

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
just going and breaking something right

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,800
a lot of times where they're helping

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
people

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
where how do you fix this how do you

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,920
find this how do you defend against this

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
maybe

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,319
what steps

64
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,160
could i have taken

65
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
to prevent this or find this

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,200
so

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
is what you see before you is really my

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
quest for that knowledge

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
so that i can share that knowledge

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,120
as i work

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,239
on my different engagements

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,760
now

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
why did i get all those certifications

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
part of the stance technical institute

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
not a pitch for them but

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,599
that's where it went out

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,480
and that's why you know i kind of

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,440
went to gain a master's because as you

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
grow in your career there are certain

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,959
things to look for

81
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,400
and i know a lot of people just want to

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
be technical

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,200
and they're not necessarily thinking

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
about a career but encourage people

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,879
to think about your careers and grow

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,879
that story right

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
learn different areas

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,360
specialize in a certain one

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
but then learn those other areas so that

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,680
you can be better at your current job

91
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
and i can think all that and paid for as

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
the us army

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,599
the one thing i did put the caveman up

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,200
here because when you do mention

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,040
penetration tester

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,120
people think of you as just someone with

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
a club that's going to go in and break

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
something

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
so with that in a lot of what i did is

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
wanting to answer right so i think

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,959
everyone's seen this right top five ways

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,799
to get domain admin before lunch the

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,799
2018 edition

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,920
right we're in 2021

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
about to go

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,680
into 2022

107
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,799
and these top five ways still work

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,680
so

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
the question is is why

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,959
we're all here

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,560
working hard

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,920
to secure businesses to lock them down

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,720
and to solve some of these issues

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,918
so why

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,839
where's the difference why in cyber

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,120
security

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
are we not making as big as an impact as

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,320
we can

119
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,240
and here for this this was 2008 i think

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
the first edition was 2015

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
which now puts us almost seven years

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
later

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,880
so

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
as i asked that question i'm like all

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
right so i've got to go learn about

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,520
businesses right

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,560
um and part of that is look when

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
business talks cyber security you know

129
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
there's some truth behind this we get in

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
there we're very highly technical

131
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,639
we're very

132
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,280
you know into it and once we grab on a

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
topic

134
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
we don't want to let go because we want

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
to solve that issue

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
so

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,039
if this is the way a lot of business

138
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
looks at us and sees us we have to

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
change that right

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
and again part part of the story and

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
moving on to that i decided to go into

142
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,600
another venture back to back to the

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
books to find out how do i speak to a

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
business

145
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
and how can you speak their language to

146
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
change some of these items

147
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,520
that are happening since

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,080
2015 are still out there

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,320
you have to speak their language right

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
you have to understand

151
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
what they are and how they communicate

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
so that's the adventures of learning

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
that and in that adventure

154
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
is really how i came about this topic i

155
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,039
see it within cyber security you see the

156
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,880
name purple teaming

157
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,919
leads a lot of questions

158
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,520
so part of that is the better

159
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,120
communications

160
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
and you know defining different aspects

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,800
one of the items you know really is

162
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
just sort of starting to find this issue

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
is really what is cyber security it's

164
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
not breaking something it's not fixing

165
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,199
something

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,160
cyber security for business

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
is there to help protect the business

168
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,840
and identify digital

169
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,240
risks so our purpose is to keep a

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,520
business

171
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
up and running to make money

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
and continue on

173
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,719
with whatever their purpose is

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
a lot of this you'll see when you come

175
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,319
into is maybe anybody have the cissp

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
right yep you'll see them talk a lot

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
about the risk

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
um you know about five years in your

179
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,160
career start moving towards that and

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
identify

181
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
um so then

182
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,599
where are we really today right so what

183
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
are the teams so this is a little

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,759
graphic that popped up

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,360
you kind of see we've got a myriad of

186
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
colors right

187
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
um maybe in cyber security some of these

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
might mean something to you

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
outside the world people are going to be

190
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,880
in the business be like what's a red

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,840
team

192
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
what's a blue team what what are you

193
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
doing you know

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
and then we start mixing colors

195
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,400
right and one of those colors is purple

196
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
so

197
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,280
is that is that a new team

198
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,719
is that a new task

199
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,120
what do you do with that for business

200
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,680
you know so how do you communicate the

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,039
need

202
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,319
for this to the business

203
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,400
and look i think they even threw in

204
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
yellow color then when mixed with green

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,840
you've got orange

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,319
a lot of different things there so i

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,840
think really

208
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,599
on

209
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,240
how people

210
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,919
arrived at purple teaming is you take

211
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
the blue team you take a red team right

212
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
you put them together they're really

213
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
there you got purple

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,000
is that is that really the team now

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,560
is there a solution there so when you're

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,840
working through

217
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
a subject or expertise or knowledge

218
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,720
right you can't just have

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
the knowledge

220
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,240
for just that like you just can't be

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
blue team eventually at some way

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,199
in your blue teaming you have to learn

223
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
how an attacker is going to come at you

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
where are they going to come from why

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
are they doing that you're not looking

226
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
just for

227
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
um

228
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,279
you know i look i've got an event is

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,880
this an alert this is an incident all

230
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
right move on

231
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
so you really need to have some

232
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,640
knowledge of more so

233
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,159
i use the terminology of when you're

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
looking through your career

235
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,880
is you're looking at

236
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
you know maybe if you're a blue team

237
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,080
right you want to be like sixty seventy

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
percent maybe eighty 80

239
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
blue team knowledge the other percentage

240
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,000
you need to have something is that going

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
to be towards infrastructure is that

242
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,519
going to be towards road teaming

243
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,360
techniques right

244
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
so

245
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
before even purple team like that middle

246
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,440
part

247
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,680
it's not necessarily a new team it's

248
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
information

249
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
and part of your your job that you

250
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,399
should be having

251
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,519
so

252
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
maybe that's advanced blue teaming right

253
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
i really haven't heard that word out

254
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,480
there why not why can't blue teamers

255
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
have an advanced practice or advanced

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
knowledge or

257
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
working on something

258
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
and then of course you have your red

259
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,320
team right whichever one

260
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
we get them in my business they want to

261
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
show up like feel like they're rock

262
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
stars you know rocking it out breaking

263
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,240
things you know a little caveman

264
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,880
but eventually as you progress

265
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
you need to have knowledge on on the

266
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,959
blue team and how the blue team works

267
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,880
right and where do you gain that

268
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
you know you need to know how to evade

269
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,959
defenses you need to know what they're

270
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
detecting what they're looking for why

271
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,880
are they looking for it

272
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
it's really turns into kind of a chess

273
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
match if you do this are they going to

274
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,399
do that

275
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,200
and in that chess match

276
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,640
we've really hit a division right

277
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
you can go back to the days it's always

278
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,440
red versus blue but why

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,399
why does it have to be red verse blue

280
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,680
you know

281
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,279
you don't need to

282
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,920
it's it's a team effort right if we go

283
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
back and take a look

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,399
at cyber security like the whole purpose

285
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,959
of that is for the business

286
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,279
you don't join a re a blue team to catch

287
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
the red team you don't do

288
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,519
a red team to kind of like i got past

289
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
the blue team

290
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,880
so

291
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,160
this

292
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
tension or this competition

293
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
has really been created within our

294
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,519
industry

295
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,480
and this is really driving the problem

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,959
that people are trying to solve

297
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,800
and some of that solution

298
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
people may have come up with is a purple

299
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,560
team

300
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
but is that

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,839
you know again questioning is is that a

302
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,640
new team right

303
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
and where does that apply

304
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
so we kind of break it back down again

305
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,760
just taking a look

306
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,519
at the different organizations you're

307
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
looking at cyber security so we've

308
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,440
defined that right you're there for the

309
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,560
business

310
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,959
you're trying to prevent the risk

311
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,320
for the blue team

312
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,600
you're looking there to defend the

313
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
organization against those attacks

314
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
now the red team a lot of different

315
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,120
definitions but you're there to really

316
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
help the business identify

317
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
those blind spots those weaknesses

318
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,200
those new tools those new tactics right

319
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
so these all

320
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
these two teams are working for the

321
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,480
business they're not working against

322
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
each other right they need to work

323
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
together

324
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,440
now

325
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,160
what's really caused this

326
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
so when you start to you know on my

327
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
quest in my journey and looking to

328
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
change that language

329
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,279
into

330
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,320
something

331
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,399
that you can communicate

332
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,639
outside of the business

333
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,320
you need to take a look at

334
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
how

335
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
is the cyber security program organized

336
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
right

337
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
so i introduced to you the silo

338
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,959
organization

339
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
this itself when you take a look from a

340
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
management or business perspective like

341
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
stepping outside of security

342
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,399
and let's see what

343
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
knowledge may be there already and it's

344
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,000
kind of causing some of the problems we

345
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,120
have

346
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,279
so a lot of times you'll end up in silo

347
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,440
organizations

348
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,959
part of the issue with a silo

349
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,639
organization

350
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
is you can have a very technical group

351
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,160
because of the exposure

352
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,519
so all the way down let's see if this

353
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,360
works ah yes

354
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
so all the way down the bottom has

355
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,760
exposures up to some of the maybe even

356
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
top knowledge

357
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
so you're getting a very good group of

358
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,240
technical people

359
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,120
and this itself although has problems

360
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,399
because

361
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,120
that leadership or that communication

362
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,519
only stays in that silo

363
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,760
so imagine if one of these

364
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
are a red team and one of them is a blue

365
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,880
team and they silo up you really don't

366
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
get

367
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
that communication

368
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
across those silos

369
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
you don't get that working you know

370
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,600
you're working on one thing for a

371
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
business and that's it

372
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,720
and these these are cause issues

373
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
in all other different industries

374
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,040
so

375
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,519
you know if we step out

376
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
this this problem that we're having

377
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
within cyber security

378
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,079
has already been solved by other

379
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,719
industries

380
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,680
these and it's known

381
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
so by taking a step out and learning

382
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
about

383
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,519
other industries learning different ways

384
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,279
to communicate

385
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,720
some of these items can be known

386
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,120
is anybody here

387
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
is there cyber security

388
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,800
sort of a silo organization

389
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,199
okay now if i say siloed purple team we

390
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,959
know it doesn't exist so all right

391
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,720
so the opposite of that of a silo

392
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
organization is what's referred to as a

393
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
matrix organization

394
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
so matrix organizations are process

395
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,959
oriented

396
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,680
so while you may have a team or a

397
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
structure that you're on you're going to

398
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
have something that comes across the

399
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
side

400
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,399
and that allows communications

401
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,839
between those scenarios

402
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
so for this as you can see

403
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,519
let's say it's just functional manager

404
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
this could be your blue team your red

405
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
team

406
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
your architecture team

407
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
and then you have a project that goes

408
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
across those teams

409
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
and this project would be cyber security

410
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,399
and here you're able to achieve

411
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
and break through that communication

412
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,279
barrier that you don't necessarily have

413
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,959
in a silo

414
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,240
these are these solve that solutions

415
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,360
so

416
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,240
is

417
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
a silo organization wrong

418
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,760
no

419
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
is the matrix solution the best answer

420
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,480
not necessarily

421
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,199
it all depends on your organization

422
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,920
but each organization structure

423
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
has its own challenges and we have to be

424
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,360
aware of what those challenges are

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
and what we need to do

426
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
to solve those challenges

427
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
it just won't stay

428
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,279
all right so just kind of going back to

429
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,720
the communication

430
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,399
and as you can see this talks a little

431
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,000
bit about the silos and the issues that

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
they do

433
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,959
so

434
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,959
going back to what i said they promote

435
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,040
highly technical growth

436
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,240
but they have an issue with

437
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,079
communication

438
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
graphics are always the best display

439
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
as you can see here

440
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
we've got people just really not talking

441
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,519
outside and this is the issue

442
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,880
of why

443
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,639
we've developed into well part of the

444
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,079
issue

445
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,480
of a red team

446
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,880
versus a blue team

447
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,600
is because you see these silos then

448
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,639
sometimes they compete

449
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
so bottom line

450
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,480
what is what is the issue

451
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
so

452
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,440
a lot of purple teams is a solution that

453
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
i think we as a cyber security industry

454
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,199
have developed

455
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
to really solve

456
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,920
that organizational structure issue it's

457
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,800
a communication issue

458
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,160
it's also can be an education issue

459
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,880
so when we take a look at

460
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,759
the need for when you're you know red

461
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,480
team like let's say you know 70 red team

462
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,800
30 blue team right

463
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,279
a lot of people have incorporated that

464
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,720
purple teaming

465
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,680
has an idea to solve that issue

466
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,640
so

467
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,919
one of the things i challenge about the

468
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
purple team is it real right

469
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,480
so what what then what does that define

470
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
as a purple team

471
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
it's an actual physical team that you're

472
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
gonna go hey go to your boss like hey we

473
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,919
need to stand up this whole new team

474
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,199
hire people

475
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,919
you know that can be a solution

476
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,520
but i don't think that is the solution

477
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,199
for an organization

478
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,959
i think when you if you identify the

479
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,200
need for a purple team

480
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,280
you can address

481
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
that need

482
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,160
by having better communication

483
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,320
by having maybe training and reaching

484
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
out

485
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,440
so maybe training your employees and not

486
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
just looking at them as only blue team

487
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,600
why do you want to take the oscp you're

488
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
you're working in the stock right

489
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
that provides value to the person

490
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
working the sock that provides that

491
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,200
education

492
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,919
that provides that knowledge

493
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,960
so

494
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
from an organization structure as a

495
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
single business

496
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,559
you may not need a purple team you just

497
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
need a different solution

498
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,760
now

499
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,039
if you look at the industry and people

500
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,880
that are talking you may have looked at

501
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
my linkedin right i say purple team

502
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,000
manager

503
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
well i'm a consultant right

504
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,520
so

505
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
i take the knowledge that i have from

506
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,000
the training i have from the skills i

507
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
developed

508
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,919
and i work with organizations

509
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,080
to increase their knowledge to share

510
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,200
them

511
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,080
to help them communicate and understand

512
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
why certain things are happening

513
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,240
happening

514
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,919
i think one of the best teams one of the

515
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
best things i've done is when i've run a

516
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,480
purple team is walk into an organization

517
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
that had the support of the entire

518
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
c-suite

519
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
and we were able to make

520
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,799
changes to the organization

521
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,720
and help advance their cyber security

522
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,919
agenda

523
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,799
and again that's a as a consultant right

524
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
and you can do that if you know you're

525
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,280
looking at a business

526
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,360
and they may be more likely

527
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
to have a blue team or someone defending

528
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
and less likely to have a red team

529
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
because

530
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
it can be seen as an unnecessary

531
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
expenditure

532
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,559
so

533
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,160
you know if you have a blue team and

534
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
they don't have that exposure to the red

535
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,960
team

536
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
you can hire a consultant to kind of do

537
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,360
that purple teaming

538
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,240
so i think with an organization you're

539
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,760
not going to necessarily find the need

540
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,480
for a new purple team to develop right

541
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
you can

542
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
increase the communications between

543
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
your different structures within your

544
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,320
organization

545
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,440
i told you you wouldn't be able to print

546
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,080
these slides out

547
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,520
so

548
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
you know

549
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
so what um

550
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,640
so what is all this about

551
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
what am i trying to say

552
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
to everybody and what do i want to say

553
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
is

554
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
you know through

555
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
my exploring for knowledge and kind of

556
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,039
that quest is

557
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
there's answers into our industry and

558
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
problems that we have

559
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,159
that can

560
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,559
really be solved through

561
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,480
by going outside of our industry and

562
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,919
taking a look

563
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
at what others have done by exploring

564
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
you know i'm having this issue

565
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
what is what is their solution out there

566
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,400
we're very good

567
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,520
at challenging technical solutions and

568
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,600
challenging people

569
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,360
when it comes to

570
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,320
cyber security right

571
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,480
you know and then a lot of times

572
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
you know we're not

573
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
internally challenging our own cyber

574
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,400
security people when someone's comes up

575
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,799
and it's like hey you need a purple team

576
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
you know do you need that what are they

577
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
trying to solve

578
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
why are they trying to solve it

579
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
you know and how can you do better

580
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,840
so

581
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,280
what do you need to take away from this

582
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,799
talk

583
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,240
well it's definitely shorter than 50

584
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
minutes

585
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
but that does give you some time to take

586
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,440
a look at the ctf maybe prep some of

587
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,000
your machines

588
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,600
i want you

589
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
to take a look at

590
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,280
some of the issues

591
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
we have

592
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
and try to find new solutions and not

593
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,799
necessarily create them and by finding

594
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,400
new solutions

595
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
do a little research look out for

596
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,799
non-cyber security

597
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,120
i also would love

598
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,240
to see

599
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,480
more cyber security people

600
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
on the business side

601
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,240
i've seen a lot of people

602
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
in organizations go from business into

603
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,880
cyber security but i don't see a lot of

604
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
people going from cyber security to

605
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,720
business

606
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
so i would encourage you

607
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
to take that technical knowledge

608
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,720
and

609
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
and transition if you can towards the

610
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,440
business side of the house

611
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
and really help

612
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,679
and eliminate maybe some of those hide

613
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,919
to get domain in five minutes you know

614
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,039
from 2018.

615
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,159
any questions

616
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,080
absolutely

617
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,559
so the question is what would be the

618
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,240
first step to take a blue team to a

619
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
purple team

620
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
um

621
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,159
so

622
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,080
you know are you looking from i'm

623
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,120
assuming you're looking from an

624
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,600
organization like you're a business

625
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,520
yeah

626
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,200
so i i don't think you need to take it

627
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,960
to a blue team

628
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,799
um i think that

629
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,320
you need to

630
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
give them training let's say you only

631
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
have the blue team you need to give them

632
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
training educate them

633
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,559
in the red team ways right there's

634
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,840
they're still a blue team right they're

635
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
still defending right

636
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,720
maybe

637
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,880
kind of define that advanced blue

638
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
teaming right does it have to be a

639
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,360
purple team does it you know why can't

640
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,440
the blue team have that advanced side

641
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
you know and that advanced side can

642
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,240
include

643
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
some of that red team knowledge

644
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
because a lot of times when i'm working

645
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
with the blue teamers through the

646
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,880
businesses that i go

647
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,720
they're really focused on i've got this

648
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
alert this happened

649
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
and they don't know necessarily know

650
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
what the next step is you know

651
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,039
why

652
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,360
why did the attacker do this right why

653
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
do they pull this information what

654
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
information did they pull

655
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,039
with the information they gathered

656
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,960
what can they do with that where's their

657
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,400
next target

658
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
and i think that is if you want to

659
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,520
define that as a purple team you can

660
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,279
but i think i would challenge you know

661
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,640
you don't necessarily need to kind of

662
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,480
create that team or break that linear

663
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,960
structure

664
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,720
there any other questions

665
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,159
okay does anybody want to admit that

666
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,360
they're they're on a purple team

667
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,360
no

668
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,200
okay how many people still believe

669
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,840
purple teams exist

670
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
nobody

671
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
i think this i wish the camera would

672
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
capture this is further evidence

673
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
that they don't exist i was right

674
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
all right thank you everybody for your

675
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,720
time today appreciate you coming um if

676
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,440
you have any questions let me know

677
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:41,039
[Applause]
