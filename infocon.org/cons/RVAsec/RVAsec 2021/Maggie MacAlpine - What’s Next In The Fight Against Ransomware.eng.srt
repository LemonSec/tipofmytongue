1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,080
so i will uh my background is in

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
election security before i came here and

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,080
bounced around at several cyber security

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
startups i'm sure some of you know how

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
that is before i landed uh with these

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,439
wonderful people who are an absolute joy

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,760
to work with and i mean that sincerely

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
um today we're going to be starting with

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,719
um

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
well the agenda i trust that you can

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,120
read um

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,040
so let me just start by talking a little

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,360
about cyber reason our corporate vision

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
no i really do sincerely believe in

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
their in this uh the world is more open

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
and connected than ever this means new

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,719
cyber risks the lack of protection it

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,719
can be disastrous can have can have

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
disastrous consequences breaches

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
impact real life so basically what we're

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,120
saying is the cyber is no longer cyber

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
as anybody who's familiar with the jbs

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,000
hack colonial pipeline and the various

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
hospital and healthcare systems shut

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
down by ransomware can attest our vision

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,760
is to protect those things with

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,360
confidence

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
and our mission is defeating adversaries

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
which is a com in a combination of tech

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
and ingenuity i think we're probably one

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,360
of the best anti-ransomware uh products

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
and services out there so i'm going to

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,040
be getting to that more close to the end

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
but first i'm going to start at the very

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
very beginning

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,880
of course of like what is uh

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,159
well first i'm gonna talk about our

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,280
researchers then i'm gonna tell you what

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
ransomware is if you don't already know

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,159
um

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,640
so since 2012 cyber reason has been on

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
the front lines of cyber security

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
research with the world's brightest

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,360
minds from the military government

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,439
intelligence and enterprise security to

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,360
uncover emerging threats across the

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
globe our research analysis of advanced

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
threats and threat actors is a group

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,439
called nocturnas this is a absolutely

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,439
world-class group that i'm very honored

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
to work with

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,759
they discovered uh some they're uh

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,040
excuse me

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
they um

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,479
for one for example addressed the not

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,719
patchy ransomware in 2017 within days of

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
not petty emerging nocturnas discovered

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
a workaround solution to disable the

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
rent and somewhere and cyberism was the

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,919
first vendor to be able to block this

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,160
ransomware strain in fact nocturnalis

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
research and technical expertise has

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,239
allowed us to be uh the first to prevent

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
not only not petya but also powershell

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,239
fileless attacks and net fileless

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,200
attacks uh our the nocturnalis insights

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
are passed directly to the customer

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
community via product and services and

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,959
updates all right i've gotten through my

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,640
required slides thank you for your

71
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
patience

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
so why do attackers use ransomware well

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
i like to start with an anecdote from a

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
bank robber whose name always escapes me

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
but he said he was asked why do you rob

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
banks and he said well that's where the

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
money is

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
so first of a bit of background so what

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
is ransomware it's a type of malicious

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,440
software designed to block access to a

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
computer system until a sum of money is

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,239
paid

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,599
generally when

84
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,519
attackers use malware they inevitably

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,920
choose between three things popularity

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
complexity and impact

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
priorities dictate where they end up

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
these things are highly complex often

89
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
have high impact but are difficult to

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,239
execute and like us

91
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
attackers are often lazy

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
very complex attacks are rarely popular

93
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
but can have great deal of impact and

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,840
popular things are not necessarily

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
complex and may not have as much impact

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,879
as others

97
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,280
but this particular attack of ransomware

98
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,319
has exploded in popularity and use

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,080
partially because it is so successful

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
and unfortunately

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
getting easier for many attackers

102
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
so it's by no means novel uh but there's

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,599
been a big increase during the pandemic

104
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,760
when attackers are attempts

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,959
when attacks are attempted they're

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,519
successful about 73 of the time most

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,799
organizations deal with the threat of

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
ransomware 51 have encountered it the

109
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
dhs cites ransomware as a top cyber

110
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,959
priorities you may have heard the white

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
house recently put out an eod uh

112
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
requiring endpoint security uh is one of

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
the tools uh to fight against ransomware

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,159
which i believe you will know we are

115
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,000
extremely aware of right now but

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
basically this this threat has been on

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
the rise and we're going to get it a

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,680
little bit into why that is and how to

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,319
combat it towards the end

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,879
so this is a slide that's courtesy of

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,480
information is beautiful which is a

122
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
great website if you've never seen it

123
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,720
before but we we used to have a a

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,880
smaller timeline of ransomware attacks

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
because we could do that we could show

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
the 10 impactful ones that is no longer

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
possible as you can see there was

128
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,880
a smaller number of impactful attacks

129
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,840
back in 2017 then a little bit of a lull

130
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
and then just an absolute explosion in

131
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,720
2020 and 2021. we actually almost can't

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
show all of the ransomware attacks i

133
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
used to do a slide of like the most

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
recent attack you might remember here's

135
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
a little insight that's now fallen out

136
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,840
of date i almost can't finish my

137
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,600
presentation and give it before there's

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
another attack and that one becomes out

139
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
of date so just to give a sense of how

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
much of an epidemic to excuse the term

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
this has become

142
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
with impacts like axa cassaya which is

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,360
also a combination supply

144
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
supply chain attack and uh jbs the uh

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
and of course uh my quote unquote

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,960
favorite but one i find most interesting

147
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
which is colonial pipeline

148
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
we'll be talking about that one also a

149
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
bit more the factors leading to

150
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
preferential use of ransomware include

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
how lucrative it is there's a low bar to

152
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,000
entry to deploy and double extortion

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,639
triple extortion actually sometimes

154
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
quadruple or even quintuple if you

155
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
really want to get into it extortion

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,919
types once they have your data they're

157
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,000
going to get you every which way that

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
they can colonial for example darkseid

159
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
had a variety of extortion methods not

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,520
just that will unlock your data

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,919
if you trust criminals to do so but also

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,440
that we're going to release this

163
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
information to the press before we

164
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
release it to the press we're going to

165
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,240
tell people who hold your stock that

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
this is going to hit the press so they

167
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
can short sell you we're going to go to

168
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
your customers and tell them this is

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
happening and each one of these

170
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
requiring a different payment of money

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
also if you don't pay us we're just

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,199
going to

173
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,720
unencrypt everything and release it on

174
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,400
the dark web that was another extortion

175
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
that they offered so once they have your

176
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,280
data

177
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,039
great great guys you know real real

178
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,880
peaches of human beings like dark side

179
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,479
are going to do everything they can to

180
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,160
squeeze money out of you

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
um

182
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,919
so this ecosystem is called the uh has

183
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,520
also exploded because of the ransomware

184
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
as a service model now when i first got

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
into cyber security about 10 years ago

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
we were seeing the beginning of malware

187
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
as a service which was kind of an

188
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
interesting phenomenon of you know you

189
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
have the target and i have the

190
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
technology i can't spend all my time

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
finding targets you can't spend all your

192
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
time developing technology will partner

193
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,600
and perhaps split profits or just sell

194
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
you the software and you'll take care of

195
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
it yourself

196
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
and basically it's become extremely easy

197
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
to use in fact their customer service

198
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
rivals and even exceeds some

199
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,919
corporations

200
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,160
i remember seeing a malware company back

201
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
in 2013 that had a pleasant female voice

202
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
on the other end should you have a

203
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
problem with their malware and needed to

204
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
call them to ask for help

205
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
um that was the russian

206
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,800
promise by the way

207
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,599
so

208
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
basically this has allowed this huge

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,039
proliferation

210
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,120
of uh ransomware uh

211
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,160
uh

212
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,400
they're basically another aspect of the

213
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,720
sophistication is you can basically i

214
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,080
don't know if anyone saw the john oliver

215
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,599
special was really quite good about it

216
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,960
but they talked about how there's a

217
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
shopping cart you know you can point and

218
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,520
click

219
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
to purchase ransomware to deploy it and

220
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
again this makes everything much easier

221
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,440
and also very much more streamlined

222
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,639
these ransomware

223
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,080
ecosystems are getting extremely

224
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
sophisticated um i call it almost a dark

225
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,960
silicon valley where all of the

226
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
ingenuity and hunger and cutting edge

227
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,599
innovation that you see in some place

228
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,360
like silicon valley

229
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
is being mirrored in places like russia

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
and in these ransomware groups where

231
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,680
they're um making enough money to turn

232
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
around and invest in the next generation

233
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,080
to invest in improving their products

234
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
there's been some advertisements lately

235
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,000
that we discovered

236
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
for pen testers they were hiring pen

237
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
testers who didn't know that they were

238
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,919
being hired by ransomware gangs so this

239
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
is a sophisticated operation that i'm

240
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
afraid is only going to continue to be

241
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
more sophisticated

242
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,039
especially as more money flows in that

243
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
they can reinvest in their companies

244
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
quote unquote really they're more like

245
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
cartels

246
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
um and i think uh i'm going to with

247
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,319
apologies to any crypto fans in the

248
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,440
audience

249
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
uh please don't come after me because i

250
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
only ever hear about crypto when it's

251
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
used for ransomware uh but i'm sure it

252
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
has wonderful other uses um but

253
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
basically crypto did in some ways allow

254
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,839
for the explosion of ransomware as a

255
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,599
service it's really hard to ship dollar

256
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
bills overseas um or to route it through

257
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
various uh shell companies and banks

258
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,000
it's much easier to just use a crypto

259
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,519
wallet

260
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,040
it's anonymous and decentralized

261
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,839
payments go without personal details and

262
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
the funds are mostly untraceable i

263
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
actually had them add that mostly thing

264
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
because of the clawback after colonial

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
pipeline where they tracked down and

266
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
drained those wallets before they

267
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
reached their uh destination but

268
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
basically as um as long as

269
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,200
crypto has been proliferating ransomware

270
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,120
has been keeping up with it because it

271
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,279
allows it to do so to make money off of

272
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
it and

273
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
this is where i say please don't kill me

274
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,399
if you love crypto but it has been

275
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,399
considered as one of the places where

276
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,240
you could potentially

277
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
reduce

278
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
the uh payout from ransomware reduce

279
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,839
those incentives if for example it's

280
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,600
easier to trace and claw back and reduce

281
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
you know have it back to normal

282
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
financial crime territory of just making

283
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,000
sure the money doesn't hit the

284
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,160
criminal's wallet not by any chance by

285
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
the way i'm not saying that's an easy

286
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
thing just that this is kind of this

287
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
untraceable currency has put ransomware

288
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,399
in another league than other types of

289
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,959
financial crimes

290
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,800
um so the evolution of ransomware now

291
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
we're going to get a little bit more

292
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,920
granular as we were saying you saw that

293
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,360
earlier information this beautiful graph

294
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
you had those big targeted attacks but

295
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,120
there weren't very many of them and now

296
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,959
we're seeing big attacks small attacks

297
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,320
common attacks everyone's getting

298
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
attacked um it's kind of funny because

299
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,839
the first uh ransomware attack was done

300
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,640
with floppy disks back in the 80s uh the

301
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
typical ransom was 189

302
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,760
there's no zeros after that uh the virus

303
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
didn't alter the files themselves uh the

304
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
file um they didn't actually even steal

305
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,360
anything it just hid the files and i

306
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
guess back then that was enough uh to

307
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,279
not know where they were on your system

308
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,959
so since then things have gotten a

309
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,320
little more sophisticated um early 2010s

310
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
we had a ransomer hot streak notable

311
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
strains and attacks were pecca not pecha

312
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
and wannacry but as time progresses the

313
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
ransoms have been getting bigger i think

314
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
two to five million i'm seeing

315
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,120
is a pretty common one the amount of

316
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
impact of the files is bigger and the

317
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,200
general effectiveness is on the rise

318
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
this is the timeline i was talking about

319
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
where the attacks were just getting so

320
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
common that i had to revert to the

321
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,240
information is beautiful graph these are

322
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
some really important and notable ones

323
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
but they are as you can recall a small

324
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
fraction of the number that are hitting

325
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
just every day

326
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,000
a more specific example would be ryuk

327
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
how these ransomware types are evolving

328
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
it's not a static threat if it was a

329
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
static threat we would have addressed it

330
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,519
and moved on right that's the very

331
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,720
interesting thing about the cyber

332
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,160
security field

333
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,920
it's constant it's almost like law in

334
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,519
the sense that both sides are constantly

335
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,440
evolving we're not facing a problem we

336
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
can just face and overcome the attacker

337
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,760
continues to evolve and hopefully and we

338
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
must keep up with them

339
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
uh ransomware uh is also evolving sorry

340
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
ryuk has been around several years at

341
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,959
this point but continues to be very

342
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,560
effective most effective strain

343
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,399
exchanging extracting ransomware in

344
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,360
2020. the dot exe was as a zero day

345
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
didn't trigger any alarms first they

346
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,600
didn't know it was a file a bad file

347
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,839
then it needed to hide the file to evade

348
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,320
antivirus now it's delivered via email

349
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,839
direct click today we're seeing file

350
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,839
list malware script-based techniques

351
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
memory only living offline and and they

352
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
don't interact with the disk so

353
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,480
basically sorry unknown malware i'm

354
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
going to click through that real quick

355
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,959
but

356
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,200
basically these are different stages of

357
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,959
innovations i would almost say it's

358
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,360
actually a little diabolically clever

359
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,560
how much they innovate and evolve so you

360
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
first had those

361
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
reused parts of

362
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,839
the file lists and now it's moved on to

363
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,519
just living in the memory just living

364
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
off the land basically completely

365
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,680
evading a lot of forms of detection

366
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
and these attack life cycles

367
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
unfortunately are often replicated again

368
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,279
and again and again it's always about

369
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
getting those permissions getting in and

370
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,040
then just escalating up the chain until

371
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,920
you have control um so you'll have spear

372
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
phishing

373
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
attack that will usually not uh start

374
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
things off could be disguised as a link

375
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,279
i'm sure many of you are extremely tired

376
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
of telling your employees not to click

377
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,279
on that link but i do try to give a

378
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,639
little sympathy to people when you

379
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
consider that ransomware gangs in cyber

380
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
criminals spend as many time hours a day

381
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
as you spend in the office thinking

382
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
about how to trick people thinking about

383
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,399
how to victimize them

384
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
it's a little bit like asking a regular

385
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
person to win a game of pickup

386
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
basketball against an nba player i think

387
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
to assume that we can always uh avoid

388
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
being fooled

389
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,839
this is their job they do this 24 hours

390
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,880
a day

391
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,600
but

392
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
once they get in through that fishing

393
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
attempt or that link or what have you

394
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,399
that email

395
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,240
then they try to get the command and

396
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
control beginning they try to compromise

397
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
credentials they work their way up the

398
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
chain

399
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,279
scan the network move laterally once

400
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,120
they're in and breach sometimes they'll

401
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,880
just sit there sometimes they'll just

402
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,399
sit there for months before they'll

403
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
begin to actually detonate the attack

404
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
and one of the reasons is backups

405
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
you once upon a time we could just say

406
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
get your backups keep your backups up to

407
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,880
date and you'll be fine we'll just

408
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
revert well now they're trying to plant

409
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
their attack early enough that your

410
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,560
backups will have to go back months six

411
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,079
months maybe you know two months three

412
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,079
months six months and even if you have

413
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,279
those backups do you really want to

414
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,120
revert back to that one and then they'll

415
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,680
sometimes poison the backups too

416
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,440
so backups are no longer the silver

417
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,800
bullet they should still be done i don't

418
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,480
think i will ever scoff at raising the

419
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,399
floor of difficulty for attackers make

420
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,440
them do that but backups are also being

421
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,160
targeted now

422
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
so from the attacker's perspective i'm

423
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
gonna skip that's an old one

424
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,399
uh this is a very i don't necessarily

425
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,600
agree with how they set this one up from

426
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,519
right to left but right to left they

427
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,639
start small and then they get into the

428
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,560
active directory domain controller that

429
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
lists the assets that are important and

430
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
tracked by the organization to drop

431
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
ransomware and impact in the environment

432
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
as a whole so every breach has a patient

433
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
zero this is the initial breach and the

434
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,279
secondary breach activities happen in

435
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
cnc attackers need to create the initial

436
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,959
access to an environment this could

437
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,639
happen in a number of ways but phishing

438
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
is a frequent culprit as we noted

439
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
then

440
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
elevate access to more important users

441
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
machines and data the attackers escalate

442
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
the invasion can take place in a variety

443
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
of ways and we're going to reference uh

444
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
mitre attack is actually a good way of

445
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
to understand this and provide a

446
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,279
starting point

447
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,399
but i'm going to and i'm going to show a

448
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,079
list of some standards to use for that

449
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,519
in a little bit

450
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,760
so we'll have

451
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
lateral movement creating more access to

452
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
the machines commanding and control

453
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,839
activities into the high value servers

454
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,360
domain controllers privileged users

455
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,320
endpoints at scale

456
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,959
more movement and then unfortunately

457
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,279
profit oops

458
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,440
once there's sufficient access to data

459
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,519
they can exfiltrate and or encrypt this

460
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,880
data right to left um

461
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
sorry that's a repeat so

462
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
i'm going to move past one but these are

463
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,279
some of the minor attack frameworks that

464
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,839
can be used to understand um

465
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,959
i'm not going to go through all of those

466
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,120
i'm going to trust that you can read but

467
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,880
or if you want to talk uh find this list

468
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,440
later absolutely come and find me

469
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,959
but what we're all trying to avoid is

470
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,920
this

471
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
this is the uh an actual ransomware note

472
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,279
uh uh ransom note from uh the acer

473
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,560
ransomware uh it uh it threatens double

474
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
the price if you don't pay in time so

475
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,399
that's a little countdown in the bottom

476
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,399
left-hand corner so that's the current

477
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,040
price after that time line ends it's

478
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
going to go to double uh so you better

479
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
be so they want you to do um basically

480
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,639
they want to hijack your brain they want

481
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,480
to make you afraid they want you to

482
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
freak out and pay them or and

483
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
what they'll also sometimes do is um

484
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
threaten you with

485
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,759
linking to law enforcement that you've

486
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,959
been breached

487
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
they'll not want you to go to law

488
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,600
enforcement they don't want you to get

489
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
help they want you to pay to make this

490
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
problem go away

491
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
and so they're going to try to scare you

492
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,360
every which way they're going to try to

493
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,600
extort you every which way

494
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,920
and this is actually that fear they try

495
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
to create in that sense of urgency which

496
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,160
anybody who's ever dealt with

497
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,399
fraudsters might be aware when they try

498
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
to create fear and urgency that's

499
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,000
usually a bad sign that's usually a good

500
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,959
point to stop take a breath and think

501
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,279
or reach out to get help

502
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,759
but that hijacking of your brain

503
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,000
is one of the reasons why we don't want

504
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,079
to say something like it's illegal to

505
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,320
pay the ransom

506
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,079
it's very tempting this is obviously

507
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,680
done with a kidnapping at one point i

508
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
believe in italy where they refused to

509
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,759
allow people to pay the ransoms when of

510
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,199
kidnappers because it was such an

511
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,880
epidemic at the time and that did

512
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
effectively curtail that particular form

513
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,320
of attack

514
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,759
but in this case um not allowing people

515
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,880
to pay

516
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,240
is more likely to drive this kind of

517
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,919
attack and the responses to it

518
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,599
underground and it will actually give

519
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,520
the ransomware attackers another avenue

520
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,199
of extortion we're going to tell the

521
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,679
authorities that you've been ransomwared

522
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
or that you may be paid a previous

523
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,839
attack so as tempting as it would be to

524
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,839
just say you can't pay you shouldn't pay

525
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,439
you're not allowed to pay first of all a

526
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,640
lot of people are going to suffer there

527
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,959
are businesses that will absolutely fail

528
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,039
there are lives on the line also when

529
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,280
hospitals and health care being hit but

530
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
more importantly from a law enforcement

531
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,720
perspective is the fear that people will

532
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,600
stop reporting if they can't pay these

533
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,120
ransoms because

534
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
of the fear and certainty and doubt that

535
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
these ransomware gangs will throw at

536
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,400
their victims to keep them not thinking

537
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
to keep them

538
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,360
wanting to pay

539
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
as quickly as possible

540
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
so that was kind of the overview of

541
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,720
ransomware and before we launch into um

542
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,640
the you know how to defend yourself and

543
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,160
whether you should pay and what you

544
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
should be doing and how great cyber

545
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
reason is because it's inevitable

546
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
because we are pretty great but i wanted

547
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
to do a quick historical tangent and and

548
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,559
i hope uh i hope people will indulge me

549
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
on this a little bit because i am a big

550
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,400
history nerd and one of the things i

551
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,919
found most interesting about colonial

552
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,000
pipeline when it first happened was the

553
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
protests by the colonial pipeline

554
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,080
ransomware gang which is dark side gang

555
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,799
saying uh we never meant to hit an

556
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
american target of this level of

557
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,919
importance

558
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,200
and i was reminded of a book i had just

559
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
read called the republic of pirates

560
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,679
where there was an arch pirate called

561
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,679
thomas every who had written a similar

562
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,240
letter after he attacked an english ship

563
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,919
he had claimed as a pirate that he was

564
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,360
not really a pirate he was more of a

565
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
self-styled privateer and he would never

566
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
attack fellow englishmen except he was a

567
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,679
criminal and he did and he was caught

568
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,640
and

569
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
but he said no no no that was a mistake

570
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
i never meant that to happen i'm always

571
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,679
an english friend

572
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
um the dark side ransomware gang claimed

573
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
that they never meant to hit as

574
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
important a target as colonial pipeline

575
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
uh infrastructure-wise whether or not we

576
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,520
believe them i think both versions is

577
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
actually pretty scary but it's very

578
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,200
similar language i never meant to hit

579
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,760
something so politically important we're

580
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,000
just honest criminals

581
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,480
and what i realized was they're very

582
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,720
very similar to age of sale pirates and

583
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,960
actually i got more excited the more i

584
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,799
realized how true this was

585
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
um holding ransom is hardly a new

586
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
business model for criminals uh but it

587
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
all that's really changed is the medium

588
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
once upon a time we used to call the

589
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,120
internet the wild west i think many of

590
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,360
us can attest that's no longer true we

591
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,240
don't have outposts where the time that

592
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,919
are getting attacked and by the time the

593
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,600
cavalry shows up

594
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,360
they can't even understand what happened

595
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
let alone explain it we're not we don't

596
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
have these remote businesses tiny

597
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
businesses being attacked online anymore

598
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,200
basically everyone kind of lives online

599
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
it's the number one medium of trade it's

600
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
our number one medium of communication

601
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,799
it's the fastest way to communicate and

602
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,799
the fastest way to do business very much

603
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,400
like the sea

604
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,240
was once upon a time

605
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
and like the sea it creates an avenue of

606
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,000
exploitation

607
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,960
so

608
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,880
i would actually suggest we might want

609
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
to start thinking about um

610
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,600
the way we break down hackers versus

611
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
nation-state hackers versus

612
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,919
defenders in slightly different terms

613
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,280
for example we'll sometimes call them

614
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
the russian hacker army i would

615
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880
respectfully say that they were actually

616
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,440
more of a navy even a privateer navy a

617
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
privateer navy being separate from

618
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
pirates pirates attack without uh

619
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
fidelity to any nation privateers

620
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,360
however are uh attacked are attached or

621
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
loosely or directly to a nation um

622
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,440
privateers tend to rise in for nations

623
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
that don't have enough money for a navy

624
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,440
who don't have enough skill for a navy

625
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
so you basically

626
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,799
you know get these private citizens uh

627
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,880
to work for you in exchange for

628
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
basically allowing turning a blind eye

629
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
to them raiding or looting

630
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
reading or looting other nations that

631
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
are your enemies

632
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,159
and

633
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,679
so i would say for example to continue

634
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,200
the metaphor north korea has a hacker

635
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,240
navy

636
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
because they pay their hackers they

637
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,039
recruit them they train them they're

638
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,640
working for the state

639
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,559
russia has a bit more of a loosey-goosey

640
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,799
relationship they look the other way

641
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,480
they say don't attack russian targets

642
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,919
and we'll leave you alone don't cause us

643
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,520
trouble don't get caught and we'll leave

644
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,440
you alone and then there are hackers of

645
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
course who have no allegiance whatsoever

646
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,200
and they are just flat out pirates

647
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
but again this is uh i i'm sorry to bore

648
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
you with my with the metaphor but it can

649
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,520
i find this actually a very optimistic

650
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
take because we've actually faced and

651
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,760
combated piracy again and again and

652
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
again throughout history we've defeated

653
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,000
it throughout history um starting with i

654
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
mean many people don't know this little

655
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,080
fun fact julius caesar got his start uh

656
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
clearing pirates from the mediterranean

657
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,679
that was how he first started his name

658
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,480
to a certain extent um

659
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
there's other parallels to for example

660
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
the ability to mask your state your

661
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,679
place of origin like your ip address by

662
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,760
putting up a false flag

663
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,200
their ability to create an economic

664
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
ecosystem to even leave and go into

665
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,799
honest work afterwards um they also have

666
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,080
the ability to for example strike and

667
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,919
retreat quickly to hide out in

668
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,400
sanctuaries and uh this is actually if

669
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
anyone's also a history fan the barbary

670
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
coast pirates i think are one of the

671
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,520
closest parallels to the modern

672
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,640
ransomware gang uh gangs of say

673
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,559
semi-friendly nations like russia for

674
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,159
example they

675
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
enjoy safe harbor in other countries and

676
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
therefore um can't really be as easily

677
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
attacked and the barbary coast wars were

678
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,039
the first international wars the united

679
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
states ever engaged in

680
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,840
so

681
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,159
the more i dug into this um i found a

682
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,760
really fantastic quote i began to look

683
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
into naval history i began to look at

684
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,840
modern naval history uh so not to get

685
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,679
too hung up on long john silver i really

686
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,640
mean like the somali pirates for example

687
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
and i absolutely love this quote so i

688
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,159
will i will subject you to the whole

689
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:44,960
thing

690
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,760
uh piracy is a non-traditional security

691
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
threat that cannot be solved through

692
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
military solutions piracy should be

693
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,799
rooted out by attacking sources of their

694
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,720
strength on land disrupting their

695
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,559
organizational structures isolating them

696
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,480
from their sources of support in

697
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
particular this means destroying their

698
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
bases and hideouts cutting off their

699
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,679
sources of capital technology and

700
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,600
recruitment and crippling the middleman

701
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
and markets that allow them to dispose

702
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,760
of their loot and this is what i mean by

703
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
the parallels to me are striking you

704
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
cannot defeat ransomware gangs online i

705
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
don't think well the actual root of the

706
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,600
problem right the supply and demand is

707
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
just too stacked um as long as there's

708
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
somebody who's willing to

709
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,919
risk the very light punishment in

710
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,440
exchange for millions of dollars there's

711
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,120
going to be another supply we can't just

712
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
you know bomb these guys from orbit is

713
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,400
what i'm saying there will always be

714
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,360
more

715
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,960
as long as these incentives are so high

716
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,640
so you have to go after the waves they

717
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
get paid you have to disincentivize it

718
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,159
you have to make it really difficult for

719
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
them to do these attacks you have to

720
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,320
make it not really worth their time and

721
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,679
there's other tactics too that have been

722
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,200
used to defeat piracy in the past for

723
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,159
example amnesties and turning uh former

724
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,320
competitors and colleagues against one

725
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,279
another

726
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,279
so by offering

727
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
a way out for them

728
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,799
also very recently when i mentioned

729
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,880
earlier there was that

730
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,679
case of a

731
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
job posting for tester who didn't

732
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,279
necessarily know they were being

733
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,200
recruited by a ransomware gang i found

734
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,559
that very interesting because one of the

735
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,640
things that pirates actually steal when

736
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,200
they took a ship was skilled laborers

737
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,799
and there was actually many court cases

738
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,000
where they would have to people would

739
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,440
attest that they were

740
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,279
press-ganged pirates they had not wanted

741
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,720
to be there and i do wonder when we're

742
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,480
going to have our first case of somebody

743
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
maybe being tried who didn't know that

744
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,159
they were working for a ransomware gang

745
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,559
but just to go back quickly i do believe

746
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,400
that this model might be useful perhaps

747
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
from a policy perspective in getting our

748
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,279
head around the the um problem might

749
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,720
help address the supply and the demand

750
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,240
in the future and uh kind of i've seen

751
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,679
some signs that people are thinking

752
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,120
along these lines already for example

753
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
the white house eod

754
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,240
and

755
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,400
how it's going after the safe harbors

756
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,240
and the sanctuaries which is exactly how

757
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,919
the barbary coast pirates were addressed

758
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,600
going after safe harbors and sanctuaries

759
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
on land making it politically

760
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
uncomfortable for them and actually i

761
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,480
believe

762
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,600
don't quiz me on this but one of the

763
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,919
ransomware gangs just got enough local

764
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,080
political law enforcement pressure that

765
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,279
they were taken down and there was a

766
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,799
good tweet that says something the

767
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,880
effect of oh it's jeff moss of defcon

768
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
and black hat he said this has always

769
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,799
been about 50 a political problem

770
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,240
because of these safe harbors because

771
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,960
they can operate with impunity uh from

772
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,799
from countries that will look the other

773
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,400
way as long as they act as privateers

774
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
instead of as pirates

775
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,279
um

776
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,960
so that's my little thing maybe it'll

777
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,039
stick out in mind if i've

778
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,720
if i've interested you i hope to give

779
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,400
that talk at the naval war college soon

780
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
i've been invited to so i just wanted to

781
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,279
give you a little preview thank you for

782
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,520
your patience on that

783
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,720
so um

784
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,679
now we're going to get into the

785
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,600
ransomware recovery and how to actually

786
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
survive once you've been hit

787
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,520
there are things like cyber insurance

788
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
data backups and the ability uh

789
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
the ability to completely recover if

790
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,360
you've been hit

791
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,520
but unfortunately as i mentioned with

792
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
for example data backups they've started

793
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
to poison data backups doesn't mean you

794
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,559
shouldn't do it but

795
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,159
make them work for it but that is no

796
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,520
longer foolproof another tempting

797
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,440
defense would be cyber insurance we've

798
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
seen a rise in cyber insurance

799
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,559
unfortunately we've also seen a rise in

800
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,240
cyber insurance payouts in fact i

801
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
believe ransomware was something like

802
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,760
some staggering number 40 is 40 70 i

803
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,919
think it was 70 of the cyber security

804
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,600
payouts by axa

805
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,640
was for

806
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,720
cyber insurance and i had heard a great

807
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
metaphor the other day that buying in

808
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
cyber insurance is like buying life

809
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,240
insurance instead of health insurance

810
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
um basically saying we're going to be

811
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
okay honey if we die we'll have a big

812
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
payout like well maybe we should just

813
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
not get sick

814
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,120
first that's a bit extreme

815
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,760
so

816
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,440
there's also some doubt about one

817
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
whether one or not can completely

818
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,159
recover

819
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,720
so what we did at cyber reasons we did a

820
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,880
survey report and it's called ransomware

821
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,240
the true cost of business it's actually

822
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
one of my favorite things that we've put

823
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,919
out it has some absolutely staggering

824
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,559
statistics uh in it from people who have

825
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,039
actually been impacted um for example

826
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,039
that sixty uh

827
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,120
sixty-six percent of course lost revenue

828
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,080
right because they'll go after your

829
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,400
payment systems they'll go after uh

830
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,360
that's what they did with cloning

831
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
pipeline right they they stopped their

832
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
ability to accept payments for the

833
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,640
length of time that they didn't pay the

834
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
ransom

835
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,760
but there was also brand reputational

836
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,240
damage there was 32 percent lost sea

837
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,200
level talent uh 29 reported employee

838
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
layoffs afterwards

839
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
so once you get hit it actually is

840
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,159
a domino effect that isn't just uh in

841
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,320
the security department or you know it's

842
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,679
not just the css head who's gonna roll

843
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,440
there's other places and departments

844
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,760
that are going to get hit

845
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,520
you get technic there's the locking out

846
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,279
of the system but there's a legal crisis

847
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,840
right if you've exposed customer data

848
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,520
there's the marketing crisis of brand

849
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,679
damage there's the boardroom crisis of

850
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,760
the liability for the breach there's

851
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,120
also um

852
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
morale damage you're going to lose

853
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
talent you're going to lose

854
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,039
sea level talent is actually one of the

855
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,960
more interesting ones that i saw was

856
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
lost as well

857
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
but also keep in mind and it's not on

858
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,159
here but that insurance thing if you

859
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,600
bought that life insurance instead of

860
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,120
that health insurance and then you just

861
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,200
got hit well your premiums are going to

862
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,039
go up if you get hit again and by the

863
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,279
way 80 of the people who paid were

864
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,520
attacked again sometimes within two

865
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,399
weeks

866
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,000
because it's no longer honor amongst

867
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,080
thieves they basically uh put you on a

868
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
list of people who are guaranteed to pay

869
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,600
and then they tell their friends go hit

870
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
this person

871
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,200
uh the best thing about that is they

872
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
were there was one ransomware gang who

873
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,039
was asked um why do you you know why do

874
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,480
you go after people who have insurance

875
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,200
and they said well you know they're

876
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,640
guaranteed to pay

877
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,000
they said how did you know who had

878
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
insurance they said well we hacked the

879
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,279
insurance company we got their list of

880
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,880
customers

881
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
i was like great love that love that um

882
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
so yeah um

883
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,159
well and by the way just a little

884
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,159
anecdote there um i think if you're in

885
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,520
the cyber security department you're

886
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
often on the defense side right you're

887
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
often the cost to your business and

888
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,760
sometimes you have to justify your

889
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
existence you have to explain that yes

890
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,120
all this money that stopped anything

891
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,720
from happening the fact that nothing

892
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,799
happened is means that i did very well

893
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,399
and they go well if you did very well

894
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,640
you don't need this much money um but

895
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,159
the problem is on the attack the the

896
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,480
attackers are on the on the profit side

897
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,760
they're the sales guys they're the guys

898
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
who go out and get a commission if they

899
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,200
do very well they get millions of

900
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
dollars they get ferraris and

901
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,720
lamborghinis so that's a little

902
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
aspect of the asynchronous warfare that

903
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,159
i think deserves some attention is the

904
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,600
fact that we are against the people who

905
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
are making the money for their companies

906
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,399
well we're always considered a cost

907
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,640
so you got it so

908
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,919
and and one that people think is like a

909
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:32,880
lightning strike it's not going to

910
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
happen except until you until it

911
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,039
actually does and that number is rising

912
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,000
so by the way again even if you do pay i

913
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,440
know i said earlier that we shouldn't

914
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
stop people from paying entirely mostly

915
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,880
because i don't want it to be used i

916
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,000
wouldn't want it to be used as a method

917
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,679
of extortion as a reason for people to

918
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,679
stay quiet about the fact they've been

919
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,840
hit but the fact is that even those who

920
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
paid didn't regain all the access to

921
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,880
their data and in fact a certain

922
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,440
percentage of it was corrupted uh 42

923
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
percent uh required said that their uh

924
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,360
cyber insurance policy didn't cover all

925
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,520
of their losses uh these are losses to

926
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,960
the data these are losses to morale

927
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
these are all those other unaccounted

928
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,720
for losses but

929
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
also the revenue and effect again those

930
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,039
premiums are going to go up

931
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,640
so

932
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,320
really and this is a terrible thing to

933
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,840
say to somebody who's already been hit

934
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
so this is not directed at anybody who's

935
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
suffered this already the best thing you

936
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,200
can do against ransomware is not get hit

937
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
in the first place um

938
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,760
because but of course to respond

939
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,360
effectively and to prepare to be hit so

940
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,279
that you can limit the damage if you are

941
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,840
unfortunately hit um

942
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
so many who were hit

943
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,520
reported having the right policies

944
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,679
believed they had the right people

945
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,679
less than 50 reported having antivirus

946
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,399
which was kind of shocking uh only 30

947
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,120
had an edr solution and only 44 invested

948
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,000
in epp or edr after a ransomware attack

949
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,679
which is a little surprising to me you'd

950
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,039
think that at least would have woken

951
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,399
them up a little bit

952
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,520
but no

953
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,320
um

954
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,559
i'll stay on that one for a second

955
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,200
so basically

956
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,640
yeah as i said the last thing you want

957
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,480
to do is get hit because the damage just

958
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,039
goes across the board and

959
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,399
this is the part where i have to pivot

960
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,840
and say nobody's going to stop

961
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
ransomware tomorrow but you still got to

962
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,440
run faster than the other guy but we can

963
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
help you run faster than the other guy

964
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
so

965
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,799
um so the one size fits all this is

966
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,240
where i get to talk about cyber reason

967
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,799
which you know i love but uh multi-layer

968
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,320
we offer multi-layered prevention

969
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,080
because the one size fits all does not

970
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,039
uh

971
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,200
uh fit uh ram

972
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,880
excuse me one size fits all approach to

973
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,240
ransomware will fall short against

974
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,799
modern threats uh we offer uh robust

975
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,559
prevention in the fight uh basically we

976
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,240
have the antivirus the next gen av the

977
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,880
behavioral document protection exploit

978
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
protection fileless malware protection

979
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
and anti-ransomware there's a couple of

980
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,679
things we're working on which i find

981
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,440
particularly interesting one is the

982
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,840
standard uh called indicators of

983
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,279
behavior which we're working on with the

984
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,760
oasis group it's basically a new version

985
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,279
of indicators of compromise but it's

986
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,440
more focused on joining behaviors

987
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,279
together to identify a threat for

988
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
example the example i like to give is

989
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,960
somebody getting into their car is not a

990
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,000
problem

991
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,159
somebody uh going for a drink at a bar

992
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,519
is not a problem somebody being out at

993
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,320
2am is not a problem uh or having their

994
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,159
keys out is not a problem but somebody

995
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,240
getting in a bar at 2 am having their

996
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,399
keys and getting their keys out going to

997
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,919
their car might be a problem you might

998
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,120
want to flag that

999
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,320
and so what we hope to do with

1000
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,080
indicators of behaviors begin to narrow

1001
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,880
down

1002
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,720
those joined behaviors those multiple

1003
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
behaviors again somebody failing to log

1004
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,080
in may have just forgotten their

1005
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,159
password somebody logging in at two in

1006
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,600
the morning might just be working late

1007
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
or in a different time zone somebody

1008
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,279
logging in 2 000 times in two minutes at

1009
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,440
two in the morning is probably a problem

1010
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
and that should be flagged and that's

1011
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,919
one of the things we're innovating on

1012
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,000
another is a cool thing which is not on

1013
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,519
this slide but it's canary files which

1014
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,760
is files that we put on the system that

1015
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,000
if they are if they're accessed will

1016
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,760
immediately start to send those flags up

1017
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,120
because they have tempting names

1018
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,440
tempting targets for ransomware gangs

1019
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,120
and they'll go for those types of files

1020
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,159
first

1021
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,760
um that if you want to hear more about

1022
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,120
that they should schedule a demo with

1023
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,559
our guys because they can really get

1024
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,080
into it um so we do operation centric uh

1025
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,519
versus alert centric we're not going to

1026
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,440
bombard you with alerts

1027
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,559
we have an aggressive focus on

1028
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,600
prevention of known threats

1029
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,880
sophisticated actors will be able to

1030
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
bypass prevention sooner or later so edr

1031
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
will be always be necessary to operate

1032
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,840
to interrupt operations and when a

1033
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
suspicious activity of attackers reach a

1034
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,240
certain threshold we convict that data

1035
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,519
we convict that data into what's called

1036
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,760
a mallop a you know malicious operation

1037
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,360
is our little coin term

1038
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,600
uh and we characterize and categorize

1039
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
these mallops uh

1040
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,399
to basically uh prevent other threats

1041
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,559
and to protect our customers so

1042
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,360
um we also try to prevent alert fatigue

1043
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,159
so a lot of entry level the the the

1044
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,760
bottom rung really enjoy us because we

1045
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,640
don't bombard them with notifications

1046
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,159
and we streamline it so there's not

1047
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,120
going to be

1048
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
somebody tried to log in

1049
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,080
freak out and like the problem just

1050
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,960
forgot their password

1051
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,200
so this is our analysis model sorry

1052
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
we're almost done i promise

1053
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,919
then we're going to jump to the q a so

1054
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,519
we collect raw data from the endpoints

1055
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,239
uh with near universal compatibility we

1056
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,520
correlate the data with other relevant

1057
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,199
events and artifacts ad hoc event

1058
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,359
management is an absolute nightmare so

1059
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,199
we analyze and enrich with intelligence

1060
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,040
to generate a detection

1061
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
the malwa is deconstructed via the

1062
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
attack the root cause scope process

1063
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,199
trees and guided remediation so for the

1064
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,040
cyber reason analysis model we don't do

1065
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,719
smart filtering like the competition

1066
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,040
does uh which is not as good we have

1067
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,800
layers in between where we correlate and

1068
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,639
analyze the operation centric view which

1069
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,639
is displayed in the mallop so we make

1070
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,480
sense of complex data relationships

1071
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,760
which is kind of where our name comes

1072
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
from in the first place cyber reason

1073
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
we reason through that

1074
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,560
so

1075
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,320
um oh i thought we were already done i'm

1076
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,199
sorry

1077
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,440
our confidence uh so basically i would

1078
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,879
say we um

1079
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,000
this is something we don't put on our

1080
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,280
marketing material too much because it's

1081
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,719
kind of like saying this titanic is

1082
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,639
unsinkable but we have an extremely good

1083
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,119
ransomware uh we have not had anybody

1084
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
severely impacted in fact one of the

1085
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
things we did was actually stop the

1086
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,920
solarwinds attack on all of our

1087
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,400
customers who we shared with them i

1088
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,839
think it was something like uh 70

1089
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,160
customers that we shared uh 40 of them

1090
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,040
had it killed uh months before it became

1091
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,640
anything we just saw some little file

1092
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,280
acting weird and nuked it about 30 of

1093
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,160
those uh it was 120 actually for uh 30

1094
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,119
of those

1095
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,000
um

1096
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,359
self-destructed when it saw that our

1097
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,760
program was in there and then uh the

1098
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,280
others were just caught a little further

1099
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,040
down line and when we were asked why

1100
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,560
didn't you like you know announce

1101
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,640
solarwinds before that attack before

1102
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,160
others did we say but we just didn't

1103
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,359
really actually know what it was it was

1104
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,560
just a little minor attack when we

1105
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,280
killed it you know months ago uh so it

1106
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,560
would have stayed in those systems it

1107
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,680
would have moved laterally and it would

1108
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,520
have exploded we saw it so early on we

1109
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,320
just

1110
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,440
you know just killed it like we would

1111
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,280
any other minor threat

1112
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
so um we have an excellent track record

1113
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
there that uh we just don't want to

1114
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
attempt fate and you know tempt our

1115
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
attempt attackers to go after our

1116
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
customers so we don't necessarily put

1117
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
that out there but we've basically never

1118
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,240
had a customer who fully implemented us

1119
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,440
suffer a serious ransomware event

1120
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,320
so

1121
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
now we can move to q a thank you for

1122
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
your patience and uh for sticking with

1123
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,359
me this long

1124
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,760
we have 10 minutes uh are there any

1125
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,720
questions hi there

1126
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,359
i don't actually so that was before i

1127
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,800
joined the company i joined in february

1128
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
i'm sorry to say um i think one of our

1129
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,760
sales guys can probably go into more

1130
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,599
detail but as i recall it just was

1131
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,040
basically it was just a little file

1132
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
acting suspiciously

1133
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,160
and so what we do is we isolate

1134
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,240
quarantine files when they act um when

1135
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,839
they act up and then

1136
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,440
they were addressed and killed so early

1137
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,359
on that i don't think they even had a

1138
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,720
chance to do much beyond that and i

1139
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,400
apologize i should have a more specific

1140
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
answer to you but it was i joined in

1141
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,839
february and i believe the attack was in

1142
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,480
january so i missed that

1143
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,960
sorry go on

1144
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,160
well that's a really interesting

1145
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,920
question i can say first of all there

1146
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,280
are things that i don't think are going

1147
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,839
to work um i don't think um you know

1148
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,359
kinetic action against these guys i

1149
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,640
don't think invading those countries is

1150
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,320
probably a good idea to hit these people

1151
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,599
i think because the supply is going to

1152
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,800
be endless the incentives are too high

1153
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,160
i think we've already started to see

1154
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
some action that has worked along those

1155
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,680
lines which is

1156
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,079
putting pressure to bear from the local

1157
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,280
law enforcement there i don't know what

1158
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
negotiations went on behind the scenes

1159
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,480
but we did have some ransomware gangs

1160
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,200
now facing uh some um issues on the

1161
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,320
ground

1162
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,800
i don't want to try to tell uh i'm just

1163
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,240
not a diplomat so i don't really know

1164
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
what diplomatic pressures they could

1165
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,920
build i would say that um just on an

1166
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
individual level the things that i would

1167
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
see as an example from the days of

1168
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,240
piracy might be making it harder for

1169
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,119
them to sell or you know uh to to

1170
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,800
distribute the loot to make money off of

1171
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,200
it so those claw backs we saw for the

1172
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,119
cryptocurrencies i might say things like

1173
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,880
amnesties if they're in countries that

1174
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,680
we access right saying like hey if you

1175
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,040
are you're really talented you're really

1176
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
good at what you do you probably can

1177
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,119
never leave russia now would you like to

1178
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,560
because we would like your help in going

1179
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,680
after your former colleagues and

1180
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,119
competitors and i know if you've been

1181
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,320
hit by ransomware the last thing you

1182
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,839
want is to give these guys a golden you

1183
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,680
know ticket out of there but uh that

1184
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
might that has been a tactic that worked

1185
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,520
in the past uh very effectively when the

1186
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
english went after piracy in the

1187
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,160
caribbean

1188
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,800
um in the 16 somethings with the the guy

1189
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,920
who wrote

1190
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,720
woods rogers uh offered amnesties

1191
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,119
um another tactic so basically make it

1192
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,040
so it's harder for them to pay to get

1193
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,280
their money out uh turn them against one

1194
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,520
another i would say i would say um

1195
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,119
make it much harder for these attacks to

1196
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,440
work so one of the hopes i have with

1197
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,560
cyber insurance i'm not going to tell

1198
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
people not to get it right it makes

1199
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,520
sense to me but what i hope cyber

1200
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,119
insurance companies will do and i

1201
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,240
believe they're going to start doing

1202
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,560
they don't need my urging is attaching

1203
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,640
more requirements to cyber insurance

1204
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,400
requiring edr if you're going to get our

1205
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,960
ransomware package requiring um that you

1206
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,480
have a certain investment in defense for

1207
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
your company cyber security defense for

1208
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,760
your company and hopefully that will

1209
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,200
help raise the floor again make

1210
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,240
ransomware attacks no longer the sexy

1211
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,680
quick money maker that they are right

1212
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
now and i think that's the only way

1213
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,640
we're going to start seeing that go down

1214
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
is if we reduce those incentives across

1215
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,680
the board but i wouldn't know what to

1216
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,520
say diplomatically because i think

1217
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,119
they're doing it i'm just not pervading

1218
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
those conversations

1219
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,359
yeah oh yeah i mean insurance tends to

1220
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,960
be on top of it in terms of keeping

1221
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,440
their money

1222
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,640
yes

1223
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
that seems like a risky endeavor for me

1224
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,760
because that target is hopefully

1225
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
engaging in some kind of network

1226
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,880
monitoring or something

1227
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,520
that might give away that ransomware is

1228
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,000
operating behind the scenes do you see

1229
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
um

1230
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,440
so i think your your line of thinking is

1231
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,480
why we saw that those those few but very

1232
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,280
big target attacks in 2017 right so they

1233
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,200
were assuming that everybody had very

1234
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,800
good defense so they were only picking

1235
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,560
their targets very carefully and then

1236
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
they were striking them in concerted

1237
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,119
method then the realization a lot of

1238
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,040
these gangs said in 2020 was wow this is

1239
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,599
a lot easier than we thought

1240
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,720
so

1241
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,400
they began to attack more often in

1242
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,480
earnest and they began to find that

1243
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,920
companies they had assumed had a lot of

1244
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,680
defense didn't

1245
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,400
um and so sitting on a

1246
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,680
i'm sure they're not just sitting on

1247
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,839
grandma's pc for six months so that she

1248
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,440
can't use backups but if they have a big

1249
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,960
target like a whale target like a

1250
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,040
colonial pipeline or similar they'll

1251
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,240
invest the time because they're going to

1252
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,000
hopefully make millions back it makes

1253
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
it's a good use of their time

1254
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,880
um

1255
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,960
to your other question well we saw with

1256
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
the ryuk one that they're they're

1257
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,560
evolving they're innovating they're liv

1258
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,319
they've now the new one is fileless

1259
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,880
malware malware that lives in the memory

1260
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,760
uh

1261
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,200
malware that doesn't have any files

1262
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,720
whatsoever uh and uh basically uh it's

1263
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,040
living off the land within the system

1264
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,240
so

1265
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,160
for current iocs again i would say come

1266
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,760
talk to our guys but

1267
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,480
that that's that that trend is i think

1268
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,800
what we went from you know

1269
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,560
surely everybody's got defense so we're

1270
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,599
only going to hit these guys if we

1271
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,200
really are ready to take them on to oh

1272
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,560
wow they really haven't invested we're

1273
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
just going to hit them

1274
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,799
sorry

1275
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,000
so we did a survey with cyber reason

1276
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,319
which is in a paper uh i'm sorry i do

1277
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,040
speak very fast i know uh it's called

1278
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,200
ransomware the true cost of business and

1279
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,359
it's available on our website it's uh

1280
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,359
it's a survey that we conducted uh

1281
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,640
across people who had been hit with

1282
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,560
ransomware it's a really good report and

1283
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,400
it will have the sources in there of

1284
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,520
where we got those numbers

1285
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,200
oh i'm sorry i didn't see you

1286
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,319
oh

1287
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,240
i mean absolutely i'm afraid that uh

1288
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,000
i'm going to say cyber reason we have uh

1289
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,440
solutions for small and medium

1290
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
businesses as well which should help

1291
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,000
small itc

1292
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,040
small ite offices uh manage that risk

1293
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,240
thank you for that setup though

1294
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,680
hi sir

1295
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,680
so as far as um what could solve the

1296
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,520
cryptocurrency issue this is the one

1297
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,280
where i'm afraid to say anything in case

1298
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,680
crypto people hate me afterwards but we

1299
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,319
should probably be get better at

1300
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,560
if it were easier to say track and claw

1301
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,920
back criminals who are using

1302
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,079
cryptocurrency to exchange

1303
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,560
that would be one method of driving them

1304
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
from these very easy green pastures of

1305
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
just you know picking up their money

1306
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,800
when they you know over cryptocurrency

1307
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,560
and drive them back into the more

1308
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
difficult uh ways of exchanging money

1309
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,240
internationally and untraceably all the

1310
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,160
shell i mean all the shell companies all

1311
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,079
of the offshore accounts all that stuff

1312
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,319
it's it takes effort and it's difficult

1313
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,040
so it does help reduce things uh down a

1314
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,160
little bit

1315
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,480
um what what i would say legally has to

1316
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
happen well

1317
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
this has been it is being looked at by

1318
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,240
people who are much more smarter and

1319
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,560
much more smarter and plugged in than me

1320
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,880
but we did see china just freaking ban

1321
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,599
it

1322
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,200
so i don't know i think people are

1323
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,560
thinking about it i don't i don't know

1324
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,760
if that's the solution uh but

1325
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,319
it's it's a problem and it's it's it's

1326
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,720
being thought about of how to address it

1327
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,160
but i wouldn't dare suggest we just get

1328
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,598
rid of cryptocurrency because i want to

1329
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,440
live uh in i'm sorry in the piracy

1330
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,560
analogy i would say you know it was

1331
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,079
often uh raw goods that were being

1332
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,240
exchanged those are very easy to mask as

1333
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,520
coming from one place you know

1334
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,119
making things more difficult raising the

1335
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,800
floor i think is always a good is always

1336
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
worthwhile but yes criminals have been

1337
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,319
known to lie so just expecting people to

1338
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,960
authenticate uh is you're gonna have to

1339
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,480
back it up of course and it sounds like

1340
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,000
they are i'm sure the currency exchanges

1341
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,200
are thinking about this too because they

1342
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,839
don't want to get shut down

1343
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,480
um i'm sorry i saw your sir

1344
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,240
oh ma'am i'm sorry

1345
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,839
it's this peripheral view i can't see

1346
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,040
oh thank you

1347
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,280
is

1348
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,240
is um are now

1349
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,440
i think going after i think it's

1350
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,200
interesting and i would need to think on

1351
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,240
this a bit more but i think it's smart

1352
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,000
to go after the saying the insurance

1353
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,280
can't pay out necessarily to the

1354
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,640
ransomware gangs because there's a lot

1355
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,319
of small businesses who will literally

1356
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,720
go under if they can't you know be back

1357
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,640
online within a few days and putting the

1358
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
onus on them not to pay is it seems like

1359
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,680
a good way to drive all of this

1360
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,520
underground if you work with the

1361
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,680
insurance companies to you know help

1362
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,599
them not you know suffer terribly from

1363
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,280
the loss you could probably work it's a

1364
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,880
smaller pool you could probably work

1365
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,560
with them better to prevent these these

1366
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,160
payments from going out or from tracking

1367
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,079
these or to track these payments when

1368
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,400
they go out so it sounds i i don't know

1369
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,160
enough about it to be authoritative but

1370
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,560
i did find it that is very interesting

1371
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,359
i think i'm being told to uh to hook off

1372
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,800
the stage the

1373
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,319
the the the

1374
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,400
academy award get over and get off the

1375
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,559

1376
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,240
