1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,279
all right so i'm caleb uh thank you all

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,439
for coming uh

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,600
they put me after lunch so if you guys

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
go into a food coma i understand

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,240
but i'm gonna be talking to you all

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
about baking security into your

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
infrastructure as code now

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,238
if you look at the title you're probably

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
going to think that this is primarily

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,079
for people that are already utilizing

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,840
infrastructure as code but we're going

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,280
to do a brief overview of what

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,440
infrastructure's code is and then how to

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,360
secure it

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,039
my goal with this is actually to reach

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,079
people

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,280
uh that are

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,719
in the cloud

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,480
using a hybrid cloud

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,079
or also on-prem

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,160
because ultimately everyone is moving

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,920
into the cloud

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,760
even highly regulated industries like

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,719
banks and

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
healthcare institutions

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,799
are already moving into a hybrid cloud

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,080
approach so

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,799
just keep that in mind as we go through

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
so a little bit about the chef going

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,200
along the lines of our

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
baking

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,560
topic

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,159
so i have a

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
degree in cyber security from liberty

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,360
university any liberty alum out there

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
all right

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
um yeah so i started out my uh career at

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,520
liberty uh in their it help desk uh

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
taught myself javascript worked my way

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,400
up through

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,799
um their it department into a quality

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,079
analyst role

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,079
uh got a couple cyber asserts and then

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,880
jumped into cyber security with the dod

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
most of my experience has been in the

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
dod and more recently getting into the

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,720
commercial industry

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
a lot of what i do is compliance

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
devsecops and cloud security uh and then

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,399
i started a cyber security consulting

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,840
company about six months ago called

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,920
secure cloud innovations and we're based

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,560
out of norfolk any hampton roads people

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
out there

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
all right sweet

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
a couple of my hobbies i like playing

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,360
guitar i do home brewing beer lovers

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
all right

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
and then i like to read

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
so our company is

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
currently looking for partnerships and

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,840
teammates and upcoming opportunities so

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
if you're interested feel free to reach

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,440
out these slides will be available later

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
so let's start talking about the recipe

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,519
requirements for

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,239
security and your infrastructures code

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,680
to start off with

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
you need one cup

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
of cloud infrastructure

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,200
it's kind of important that's the basis

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
that we are building the infrastructure

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,560
off of so you need a good cloud provider

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
now we need two fluid ounces of

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,840
infrastructure as code it'd be very

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,879
difficult

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,640
to secure your infrastructure's code

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,399
without infrastructure as code

79
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
then we need three tablespoons of cicd

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,239
we're going to get into what that means

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,800
and ultimately talk about a little bit

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,879
about pipelines

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,319
and then you fourth a couple of open

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
source tools

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
and hopefully we are already using some

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,519
open source tools if not uh

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,640
well hopefully this will get some

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,040
of the brain juices going

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
and then as we all know nit need one

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,319
gallon of coffee for anything

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
so uh cloud infrastructure options now

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,159
there's a lot of cloud infrastructure

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,200
providers out there uh aws leading the

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
market with 33 of all applications being

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,799
run there

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,920
followed by azure and then gcp

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
you know you have heroku alibaba ibm and

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
oracle there as well um a lot of those

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
are more niche cloud providers and

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
i think i'd be remiss if i jumped over

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,439
this and didn't talk about uh briefly

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,640
what

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,920
differentiates some of these cloud

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,519
providers so

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
aws in particular

106
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,200
definitely uh

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
well aws and azure

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,760
and 99 of cases are completely

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
comparable you know you're not gonna see

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,080
much of a difference right

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
however

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
if you're looking for just a straight

113
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,440
infrastructure as a service platform aws

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
is the one you want to go for

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
that has to do with dealing with runtime

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,639
middleware and operating systems on top

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,479
of building your applications

118
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
and managing the data

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
whereas azure would be better for just

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,080
platform as a service

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
when you're building applications or

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,800
managing data

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
or if you already have a windows

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
environment and you want to integrate

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
that into the cloud so if you're running

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,520
an active directory you know you have

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,040
your domain controllers and all that

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,199
azure makes it really easy for you to

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
move that up into the cloud

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
gcp

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
has better prices than the other two

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,840
however it does not have as much global

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
reach

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,680
so

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,240
you're giving to

136
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
so now we'll talk about infrastructure

137
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
as code the advent the options

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
and why

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,880
sticking with our analogy of

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
baking

141
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
i figured i'd talk about

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,960
the electric standing mixer which

143
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
i'm sure none of us really use that

144
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,680
often unless you actually bake i for one

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
have to admit that although i chose this

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
as the analogy i don't tend to bake very

147
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
often

148
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
so

149
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,280
if i make a social faux pas

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,800
when talking about this please bear with

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
me

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,199
um

153
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,000
but

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
i did take the time uh to try to make a

155
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,080
pie

156
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,639
uh prior to doing this and

157
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,919
in mixing i decided to do the manual

158
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,080
labor version of mixing is where you

159
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,759
grab your bowl and you grab your wooden

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,639
spoon

161
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,240
and you just

162
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
you know churn

163
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
and uh being an id and working in front

164
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,280
of a computer all day uh

165
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,199
i was worn out after about

166
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,560
five seconds

167
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
of training but uh

168
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
with electric standing mixers it

169
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
actually was able to solve two problems

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
when barbara johnson created this in

171
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,880
1908

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,160
uh one

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
it increased

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
the speed

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
that the ingredients could be mixed

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
right

177
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
it also

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,880
allowed people that were using that

179
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
to multitask

180
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,199
right

181
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,919
so you leave it there it's mixing itself

182
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,600
and you can go and

183
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
pour i guess milk into a bowl or chop up

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,039
tomatoes or whatever it is you do while

185
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,520
you're baking

186
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,479
but

187
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,840
this kind of comes down to the same

188
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
principles as to why

189
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
infrastructure's code was created and so

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
the first infrastructures code tool was

191
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
the cf engine

192
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
and that was created in 1993

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,919
by a man named mark burgess

194
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,120
he made the first automated

195
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
configuration tool for infrastructure

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
and the story with mark is pretty cool

197
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
he's actually a physics professor

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,759
studying to get his phd

199
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,840
and being one of the newbie uh

200
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,319
professors all the other uh professors

201
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,479
gave him the servers and computers that

202
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,080
the physics department had

203
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
uh to manage and and manage the

204
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
configurations of

205
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,960
and after doing that for a little bit

206
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,840
you know he got pretty tired and

207
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
you know i heard yesterday that like

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,960
the phrase i t people are lazy and you

209
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,319
know i was gonna say something about

210
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
that in my powerpoint but

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,919
but i i truly truly i don't think we're

212
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,080
lazy we just understand that there could

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,759
be a better way of doing things right

214
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,120
we're more innovative more creative and

215
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,759
ultimately uh we have the power to make

216
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,960
those changes

217
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,879
right here right right in front of us we

218
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,720
have all the tools that we need uh right

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,319
there and so

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
uh in a similar way mark decided that

221
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
you know he didn't want to go and make

222
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,879
the same configuration change on every

223
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,440
computer over and over and over again

224
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,599
and instead wanted to be able to have

225
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,160
all of it coagulated into

226
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
one tool one unified management service

227
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
for the servers and desktops

228
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,560
now cool story um

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
the cf engine is actually on its like

230
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,280
third version now so it's expanded and

231
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,960
is able to

232
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,000
handle consumer and industrial devices

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
embedded network devices mobile

234
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,880
smartphones and tablet computers

235
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,360
kind of neat

236
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,958
but along those lines we have a couple

237
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
of different infrastructures code tools

238
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,040
that you're able to utilize when

239
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,000
managing your cloud infrastructure

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
uh terraforms listed first because

241
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
that's my favorite not any other real

242
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,200
reason

243
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,680
aws cloud formation

244
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
is aws's proprietary cloud native tool

245
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,200
for um provisioning

246
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
azure resource manager azure's gc

247
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
deployment manager you guessed it google

248
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,720
cloud

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,200
uh terraform in particular i'll go back

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
real quick is one of my favorites

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,680
primarily because it is cloud agnostic

252
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
so you can deploy to multiple cloud

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,640
cloud providers at the same time

254
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
or transition you know your current

255
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,240
environment from aws to azure uh fairly

256
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
easily there's some configuration

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
changes that have to be made but

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,279
um

259
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
but ultimately it has that capability so

260
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,959
it's kind of cool

261
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,959
then you have chef puppet salt stack

262
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,599
couple others

263
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
but the question is why information is

264
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
code and we kind of answered part of

265
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,560
that

266
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
with the fact that speed and

267
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
multitasking right because this allows

268
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,440
you to go and do other things

269
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
but one of the big things that i would

270
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,800
be again remiss to glance over would be

271
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,040
state and in particular recoverable

272
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
state when dealing with infrastructure

273
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,279
is good so the term state refers to the

274
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,560
state of affairs

275
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
of the desired infrastructure resources

276
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,839
in a deployment

277
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,720
right

278
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,279
so there are at least three states at

279
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,440
any given time

280
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,880
there's the actual one that's in the

281
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
cloud right there's actually the

282
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
resources that have been provisioned in

283
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
whatever cloud

284
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
providers

285
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
environment that you're using

286
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
at that given time

287
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
there is the ideal state presented in

288
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
the code so what you've actually written

289
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,360
out

290
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
and is sitting there in your code

291
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,160
repository

292
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,839
and then there's the cache state that

293
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,760
the information or the

294
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,839
infrastructure as code tool maintains

295
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,160
which would be every time you deploy

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
that infrastructure as code

297
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
configuration

298
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,040
it keeps that state file

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
and there's also disaster recovery

300
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
infrastructures code's really important

301
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,839
because

302
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,839
as you all know at some point

303
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,360
everyone gets attacked

304
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
right everybody gets attacked

305
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
and

306
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
sometimes they get through and sometimes

307
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,959
your environment just gets wrecked and

308
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,760
so

309
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
it's really important to be able to have

310
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
a way to redeploy your environment

311
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
hopefully more securely this time

312
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,120
uh in a new area

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
so in particular this is incredibly

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
important given the fact that with

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,800
infrastructure as code you specify what

316
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
region

317
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
and i'm going to speak specifically from

318
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
aws right now but you

319
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,640
would specify which region

320
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,240
you deploy

321
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
your cloud configuration

322
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,839
and resources into

323
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,720
so let's say you're in us east right

324
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,399
and something happens

325
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
and you lose

326
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,040
the ability to use that environment

327
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,160
all you do is you go into your

328
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,680
infrastructure's code

329
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
you change the region from us east to

330
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
u.s west and you hit go

331
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
or type terraform apply in the terraform

332
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
case

333
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,399
and it builds the entire environment in

334
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,440
an entirely new region from scratch

335
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
i mean it's incredible for me this was a

336
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
game changer when i found out about

337
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,760
infrastructure as code

338
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
there's also auditability

339
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
so you're managing infrastructure using

340
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,279
source control

341
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,279
the same way that you handle managing

342
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,360
your actual code

343
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,839
or managing actual resources within the

344
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,800
cloud

345
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,240
which allows you to go back to the

346
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
previous commits that have happened and

347
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,600
see exactly the paper trail per se

348
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,880
of changes that were made to your

349
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,439
infrastructure

350
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
there's also repeatability now how many

351
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,279
of you out there are developers

352
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,639
okay i see a couple hands

353
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,320
one of the biggest challenges that i've

354
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
found

355
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
in consulting and also in all the

356
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
different it roles that i've had

357
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,079
is that

358
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
excuse me

359
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
is that uh the dev test stage

360
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
environments whatever you have right

361
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,519
before fraud

362
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
can sometimes

363
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,360
not accurately reflect

364
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,160
what

365
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
is in production and that presents a big

366
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,440
issue

367
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
um because of let's say you have a

368
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
dependency in production that you don't

369
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,320
have in dev or stage or test

370
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
and uh you create a new functionality

371
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
and you push that into production

372
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
and you've not tested it with that

373
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,000
dependency i mean that could break the

374
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
whole application or or

375
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,920
in this case environment

376
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,519
and that's a big deal

377
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,680
so

378
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
the repeatability of this is that you

379
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,959
take the same code that you wrote to

380
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,760
provision your production environment

381
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
and then you use that same code to

382
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,120
provision your dev

383
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
test stage environment

384
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,040
with a couple name changes here and

385
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,920
there

386
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,880
and you have the exact same environment

387
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
and so i think you guys get the

388
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,880
repeatability part of this

389
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
and i also think you get the speed part

390
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,279
of this um

391
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,639
how many of you have ever gone through

392
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
aws and provision one instance

393
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,519
okay uh

394
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,959
to all of you out there that have done

395
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,560
this was it accurate that i could say

396
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
that it takes probably about one to two

397
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,399
minutes to do that

398
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,920
okay for one instance and you know most

399
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,040
companies

400
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,800
most organizations are not running just

401
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
one instance they're running

402
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,920
i mean i've worked with a couple

403
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
companies they're running over a

404
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
thousand instances

405
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,760
and so that

406
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
that adds up right with time and

407
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,519
resources that go into provisioning this

408
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
so what this does is it allows you

409
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,399
to

410
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
speed up the process because

411
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,519
the tool itself can actually provision

412
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,279
way faster than any human could go

413
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
through and click next next next done

414
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,959
as

415
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,399
my other

416
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
colleague yesterday

417
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
spoke about infrastructure's code that

418
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,719
was the phrasing he used

419
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,079
it also reduces risk

420
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,120
now this is

421
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,240
really along the same lines of

422
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,519
repeatability

423
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,959
because the risk involved is that you

424
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
have state slippage

425
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
where the state

426
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
one of those three states is different

427
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,839
from the other two

428
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
and it's not actually known

429
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,959
and finally there's cost reduction

430
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,120
cost reduction is interesting because

431
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
there's obviously the um

432
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
manpower the labor that goes into

433
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
provisioning the resources right that we

434
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,639
just talked about

435
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,639
uh and that can be expensive for

436
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,920
companies and for people but

437
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,079
the really interesting thing is that if

438
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,519
you get into

439
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,199
environments that don't require high

440
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,720
availability

441
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,120
infrastructure as code allows you to

442
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,519
spin up or spin down resources anytime

443
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,199
you need them

444
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,880
but specifically emphasizing that you

445
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,279
can spend down resources when you don't

446
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
need them

447
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,920
so

448
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,519
uh one of the first

449
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
infrastructure teams that i was a part

450
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,480
of doing cloud infrastructure they

451
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
had a

452
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
again a not high availability

453
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,320
i guess low availability i've never

454
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
heard anybody use that before but low

455
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
availability um environment

456
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
and uh someone had mentioned to me you

457
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
know why don't you just spin down

458
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,199
instances in order to save money on the

459
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,959
weekends because nobody's using any of

460
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,680
them

461
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
and it was really interesting and i

462
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,680
thought about it and i came up with a

463
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
proof of concept and i brought that to

464
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
my program manager at the time

465
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,040
and

466
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,560
presented it to him and he

467
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,920
seemed a little skeptical at first but

468
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,519
we decided to try it so for a month we

469
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,600
did that every weekend we'd spend down

470
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,079
those instances that were running um

471
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,600
and you know you were able to leave up

472
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,120
vpcs and

473
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,040
security groups and all that stuff just

474
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
just the instances

475
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
and we were able to save 15

476
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
of costs by doing that i mean it was

477
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,880
incredible and if you show me a stock

478
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,920
right now that gives 15 returns i i will

479
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
go put all my money into that that'd be

480
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,040
awesome

481
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,199
but it was really cool because it was a

482
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,199
real life

483
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,799
thing that happened where we were able

484
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
to show that cost reduction is an actual

485
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,119
byproduct of utilizing infrastructure as

486
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,280
code now that's not applicable across

487
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,640
the board right like i'm sure some of

488
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,520
you

489
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,359
i'm sure a lot of you work in high

490
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,640
availability

491
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,799
environments but there are ways to

492
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,520
utilize it to bring about cost reduction

493
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,959
hopefully this gets kind of the ball

494
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,439
rolling for you guys similar to that

495
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,440
person that spoke with me and mentioned

496
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,840
the opt-in the option

497
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,919
to spin down instances on the weekend

498
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
but what's missing

499
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
so we just went through all those things

500
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
why infrastructures code but what is

501
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
missing

502
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
what's missing is verification and

503
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,480
validation of security

504
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,320
so how do we verify

505
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,080
and validate that the instruct the

506
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,360
infrastructure is actually secure

507
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,919
you can't just say it's secure

508
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,039
you have to have some kind of

509
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,960
third-party verify

510
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
that you are secure

511
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,600
um you know to those of you out there

512
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,799
that work on

513
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,679
uh application development teams or um

514
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,440
even infrastructure development teams

515
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
you know if one of your app admins or

516
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,760
systems admins came to you and told you

517
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
that they had fixed vulnerability that

518
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,000
you told them about

519
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,960
are you just going to take them for

520
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,559
their word and believe them and move on

521
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,160
and never look never look at that again

522
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,200
no

523
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
no that's silly because we know that

524
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,799
that people make mistakes i mean i don't

525
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,679
know about you guys i make mistakes but

526
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
but people make mistakes

527
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
so you have to verify that

528
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,799
so pop quiz just make sure you guys pay

529
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,120
attention did i mention security on the

530
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,840
last page

531
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,559
no and and it's interesting because you

532
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
know there's some articles online that

533
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,679
if you go and read them they say

534
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,520
infrastructure's code is

535
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,120
inherently

536
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,760
secure that from the get-go as soon as

537
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,039
you're using infrastructure as code

538
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,039
you're secure

539
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,960
that's not true right even even if you

540
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
code in security into your

541
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
infrastructure so you're building in

542
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
again i'll go back to aws you're voting

543
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,440
in watch cloudtrail alarms into your

544
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,280
infrastructure code that's great your

545
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
infrastructure when it is provisioned is

546
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
secure

547
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
but

548
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
how do you verify that

549
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,000
how do you know it's secure

550
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,799
how do you know what you coded was

551
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,200
correct

552
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
that brings us to the topic of pipelines

553
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,360
now i have to preface with something

554
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
the last time i spoke to somebody about

555
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
pipelines trying to describe what what

556
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
they were uh i thought it went really

557
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,880
well

558
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
it was with my with my neighbor

559
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,280
and i got through talking to them about

560
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
it and the next day i came outside and

561
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,200
on their lawn

562
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,559
i was really confused i didn't

563
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,080
understand

564
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,919
what i said or

565
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,799
yeah i know i don't

566
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
but we'll talk about ci cd

567
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
how many of you actually utilize cicd

568
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,039
and pipelines right now

569
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,000
hands up in the air please please okay

570
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,679
good good

571
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
so cicd continuous integration

572
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,320
continuous deployment

573
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
so what is cicd

574
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,679
ci cd is a method to frequently deliver

575
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,640
apps

576
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
or in this case infrastructure to

577
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,919
customers

578
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,240
by introducing automation into the

579
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,919
stages of app development

580
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,679
i mentioned pipelines

581
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,039
and

582
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,799
a pipeline in particular is a series of

583
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,720
steps that you take

584
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
that have to be performed in order to

585
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,400
deliver a new version of software

586
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,679
so right here

587
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,400
we have a chart it's a list of pipeline

588
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,360
products

589
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,159
um five of them it's not extensive by

590
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,679
any means

591
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,159
but they are fairly popular

592
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,520
and i'll admit i've only used three of

593
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,120
them so jenkins

594
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,039
bamboo and gitlab

595
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,080
i don't really know anything about

596
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,039
circle ci or team city but

597
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,720
if you're utilizing environments that

598
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
could utilize

599
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
or that could um use those two

600
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
particular feel free

601
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
uh i'm not advocating for one over the

602
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,559
other however i will say if you've never

603
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,760
done anything with ci cd pipelines uh

604
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,840
jenkins is free

605
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
so jenkins is a great way to kind of get

606
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
your feet wet

607
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,320
just see what it's all about

608
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,280
and

609
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,918
and play with it

610
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,360
so with pipelines you need steps for

611
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,679
stages that are used to move the code

612
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,520
through the quality analysis

613
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,000
and security process of development

614
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
right the goal is to automate as much as

615
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
possible so you get your code out fast

616
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,320
to your customer a more agile way

617
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,120
so

618
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
when security's left out of the devops

619
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,080
pipeline party

620
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
i can't take credit for this this was

621
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
beat chess lock's picture

622
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,240
that he put together at uh dev ops day

623
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
a presentation that he did previously

624
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,360
but it does say a lot

625
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,440
when security is left out it's uh it

626
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,799
becomes a big deal

627
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,120
mainly because no one's happy right

628
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,640
devops they

629
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,960
put out stuff

630
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
that

631
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
then has to be iterated through again

632
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,320
because security finds things

633
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,559
and um they want to be done you know you

634
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,919
want to move on to new projects when

635
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,000
you're a developer like get onto the

636
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,360
next thing

637
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,199
and security just wants to be secure

638
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,520
oh and then this has a link at the

639
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,679
bottom as well in case you want to go

640
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,720
and

641
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,480
pay respects to men that made this

642
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,919
but we'll talk about open source tools

643
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,520
because that's pretty important when it

644
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,918
comes to

645
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,919
infrastructure as code and in particular

646
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,559
it's becoming a more commonplace uh

647
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,679
practice in our industry

648
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,559
so to begin with terrascan

649
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,200
terrascan is cloud agnostic

650
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
and can run locally or in a cicd

651
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
pipeline

652
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
excuse me

653
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
and it stands for misconfigurations and

654
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
it's super super easy to integrate i'll

655
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,200
show you guys an example in a second

656
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
then you have check off

657
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
check off can be used in gcp

658
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,159
azure aws

659
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,960
and specifically scans terraform and

660
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,559
cloud formation and for those of you

661
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,679
that love it

662
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,960
uh it's python based

663
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,279
as someone who likes star trek and it's

664
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,559
hard for me not to like that one

665
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
you have tflam which this is an open

666
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,039
source tool it doesn't actually do the

667
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,760
scanning process of for security but

668
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
does check your code for common errors

669
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,000
and mistakes

670
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
if terra firma

671
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,799
cloud spoil

672
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,799
and hashicorp sentinel clownspoi is

673
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,159
interesting because

674
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,960
that is specific for aws and so it's

675
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
catered towards cloud formation

676
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
templates um it only does aws

677
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
and then hashicorp sentinel is also

678
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,880
cloud agnostic and works with all hash

679
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,279
core products

680
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,159
so here's that example i told you guys i

681
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,320
was going to have this is how easy it is

682
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,360
to integrate terascan into your ci cd

683
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,159
pipeline it is literally

684
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,760
what one two three four five six seven

685
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,440
lives or so

686
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,039
um

687
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,520
that you put in there all it requires is

688
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
a stage

689
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,440
which in this case is called scan

690
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
a job which in this case is called

691
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,130
terrascan

692
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,679
[Music]

693
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,679
your image

694
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,120
and script

695
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,440
it is written in go by the way

696
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,919
if you couldn't

697
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,360
and then

698
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
this is not exactly a terrorist game

699
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,840
example it is actually a gitlab cicd

700
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,480
pipeline example but i put it up here so

701
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,080
you can see at least what the goal would

702
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,919
be which is the three check marks right

703
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,279
here those are stages that you go

704
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,880
through as performing jobs

705
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,840
so we got about four primary concerns

706
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,520
right with security when dealing with

707
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,039
infrastructure is code

708
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,440
we've got misconfigurations but

709
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,799
we've kind of knocked that one out by

710
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,559
talking about the open source tools that

711
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,080
you can utilize to catch those

712
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,679
misconfigurations

713
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,799
we've got managing secrets you know like

714
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,480
in elementary school and

715
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
hey i like so and so yeah like

716
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,640
no no no it's passwords it's api keys

717
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,200
it's all that good good jazz

718
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
uh talk about government code security

719
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,000
code and csd integration

720
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,039
when managing secrets

721
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,360
i'd like to use the acronym bruce

722
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
start by building gates into the

723
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,240
pipeline

724
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,159
very important that as you have

725
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,919
pipelines

726
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,600
that's not just about the pipeline

727
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,360
itself right you can go up to something

728
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
and say hey we use cic pipelines that's

729
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,640
pretty cool

730
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,520
it just stands up the application

731
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
like that that's great and all but from

732
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,919
a security point of view we have to have

733
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,520
security gates built into that otherwise

734
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,679
it's just another means of deploying the

735
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,919
app right

736
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,240
then remove you want to remove existing

737
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,480
plain text passwords i mean that one

738
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,080
i know that one's difficult for all of

739
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,240
us to know but uh figured i'd put it out

740
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,279
there

741
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,279
then utilize you want to utilize secret

742
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,240
servers that's something that you can do

743
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,400
to manage your secrets there's plenty of

744
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,159
options out there i have a couple listed

745
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,159
there but ultimately these are servers

746
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
that you can house your secrets in and

747
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,039
then call on from you know your

748
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,840
pipelines and such

749
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,039
check

750
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,559
you want to check the commits the

751
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
previous commits for sensitive data as

752
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,960
well

753
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
because as i said before we all make

754
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,200
mistakes at least i do

755
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,919
and every once in a while something

756
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,520
could be found there

757
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
and then finally encrypt

758
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,360
we want to encrypt secrets and usually

759
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
tools have that built in

760
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,799
as a functionality i definitely

761
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,720
encourage all of you to look into that

762
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
as you are managing and building your

763
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,640
pipelines

764
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,480
now we get to govern encode secured in

765
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,799
code

766
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,440
it's kind of an interesting concept

767
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,679
but it's fairly simple

768
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,480
it's

769
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,240
don't perform

770
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,840
security changes

771
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
through manual configurations

772
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,919
as you're utilizing infrastructure's

773
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,120
code

774
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,840
that is really easy and it's probably

775
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,679
the uh worst thing that you could do

776
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,399
when utilizing infrastructure is code

777
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,919
um to

778
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,080
tell yourself i'm gonna go make this

779
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,159
change right now i'm gonna go fix this

780
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,799
this issue manually and i'll come back

781
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,159
to it later and i'll i'll have it

782
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,000
reflected in the code then this will be

783
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
fine uh i'll come back to it because you

784
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
know what will happen is you'll go do

785
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
that change and your boss is going to

786
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
come to you and be like hey i need you

787
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,279
to go through this and you'll be like

788
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,240
okay

789
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,760
i'll come back to that eventually and

790
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
then and then

791
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,720
another thing comes up and you go okay i

792
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
gotta fix that too and then eventually

793
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
you have state slippage like i mentioned

794
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,360
earlier

795
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
so it's government code you want to

796
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,080
secure it in the code right so you build

797
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,159
in as i mentioned earlier the alarms

798
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,880
that are there the security that needs

799
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,840
to be

800
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,159
implemented for each of your instances

801
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,679
and in your environment

802
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,919
you know don't stand up a laugh

803
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,360
and not have it reflected in your code

804
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,240
it's pretty simple right

805
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
there we go

806
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,200
government code security code apparently

807
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,279
that was backwards

808
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,480
i mention i make mistakes

809
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,799
but we got some concluding remarks so

810
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,240
first off you want to become familiar

811
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
with infrastructures code no matter what

812
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,440
environment you're working can i see a

813
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,559
raise of hands of people that have

814
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,080
actually dealt with infrastructure as

815
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,559
code before

816
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
okay

817
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,960
so for me personally and i don't know

818
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,200
what the case is for the rest of you but

819
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,279
i have grown the most in my life and in

820
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,480
my career

821
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
by actually testing things out on my own

822
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,279
for fun

823
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,799
just to see what could happen

824
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,559
and you have plenty of opportunity to do

825
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,039
that with aws and azure at least those

826
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,760
are the two that i've played with most

827
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,399
aws gives you a free tier account for

828
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,120
one year after signing up azure gives

829
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,039
you i think 200

830
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,760
250 worth for a month

831
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,799
for free

832
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,360
to just go and stand stuff up and mess

833
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,520
with it i would highly encourage those

834
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,799
of you

835
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,600
who

836
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
have not actually dealt with

837
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
infrastructures code yet to go and just

838
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
play with the tools

839
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
going to research

840
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,840
you know how to

841
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,320
create a cicd pipeline using jenkins if

842
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,159
it's free and it's there and that's what

843
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,760
we're moving towards as you know i.t

844
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,919
then

845
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,840
just for me to you i would suggest it

846
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,799
don't assume anything is secure but

847
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,159
specifically

848
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,559
don't assume that your infrastructure as

849
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,918
code is secure

850
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,799
and then uh utilize cicd pipelines for

851
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,880
securing your code right there's a lot

852
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,320
of ways that you can superior code you

853
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,440
can do

854
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,399
static analysis manual static analysis

855
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,039
if you really want to but

856
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,840
we're trying to cut down on time like

857
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,919
with doing this stuff right we want to

858
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,720
be

859
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,760
moving

860
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,120
on to and working on other things

861
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,000
so

862
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,200
the goal is to utilize automation as

863
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,840
much as possible

864
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,559
and then remember bruce

865
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,440
build

866
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,480
remove

867
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,919
utilize

868
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,120
check

869
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,200
and encrypt

870
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
and so you stick your cookies in the

871
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,640
oven and you get a cake

872
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,679
and that's all i got anybody have any

873
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,679
questions

874
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,320
yes

875
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,720
so artifact scanning

876
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,360
generally

877
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,360
can you be a little bit more specific

878
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,919
sure yeah um so the question is when

879
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,200
uh artifacts are created uh how can we

880
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,840
secure those artifacts as well um

881
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,200
utilizing

882
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
tools

883
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,799
i think that the best way to

884
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,039
answer that question is

885
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,480
one i think it depends on what the

886
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,120
artifact is

887
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,039
frankly i don't necessarily think in a

888
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,640
lot of this that there's a one size fits

889
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,679
all

890
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,200
but um

891
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,960
two

892
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,760
static code analysis is really important

893
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,120
and with artifact creation in particular

894
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,840
i mean you can build

895
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,720
you know i'll i'll do some research and

896
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
i'll get back on back to you on that

897
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,279
that'll be good

898
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,679
any other

899
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,199
questions right well thank you all for

900
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,740
[Applause]
