1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,519
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
thank you all for coming to rva sec hope

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,039
everybody's having a great time

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,439
uh we'll be talking about 5.4 million

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,439
vulnerabilities and counting

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,880
talking about vulnerability management

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
frameworks

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,279
this is also the slide is no longer

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,800
accurate that number is well over six

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
million now uh rolling up on seven

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,920
but i had to create the title

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,120
a ways back before all the

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
vulnerabilities finished rolling in

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
my name is john biehan i am

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
i've been spent 25 years in i.t

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,960
uh started

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
in education worked for community

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
college i've worked at the martin agency

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
here in richmond procter and gamble i

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,879
currently work for newport news

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,399
shipbuilding

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,399
down in newport news virginia

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,000
my first adventure with vulnerability

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
management was the summer of 2001

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,680
uh

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,438
sort of a surprise opportunity to jump

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
into vulnerability management with

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,840
surcam nimda and code red viruses all

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
over one summer it was a glorious time

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
for those who remember it

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,840
a little bit about my company

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,799
oh wow those aren't moving

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,759
we're not getting movement on the slides

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,799
they're moving here but not there

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
give us just a moment here

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,200
get these

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,799
[Laughter]

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,360
2 59 a.m i'm not going to be that guy

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,799
anyways i work for newport news

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,119
shipbuilding

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,479
we are the

42
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
only manufacturer of nuclear aircraft

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,520
carriers in the western hemisphere

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,360
we are also one of two companies that

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,479
makes nuclear submarines

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,560
we get some attention

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,079
we get just a little bit of attention

48
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,399
and vulnerabilities have a high risk

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
level for us we really would all prefer

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
north korea and not have a forward-class

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
submarine especially now that we've got

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
the issues worked out

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,760
my team is four people the vulnerability

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
management team is four people

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
uh and we have been 100 remote since

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
march 13th of 2020.

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,680
just to give you a little bit of

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
background on it

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,959
and i have one of my team members is

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,319
here joining me brian in the front row

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
here so he's going to keep me honest

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
or at least throw things at me later

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
[Music]

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,959
um we have about 70 to 80 000 devices in

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,640
our environment

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,120
about 27 000 direct employees

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,640
quite a few thousand more

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,120
contractors vendors on site

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,959
so it's a very large environment

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,560
talk a little bit about some of our

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
background some of the things that we've

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
dealt with

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
coming into this 2017 you're starting to

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,480
face a lot of increased regulation uh

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,879
contractual obligations with the navy

76
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,319
in addition to stocks compliance

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,000
deforest compliance we have a long stack

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
of them

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
that we have to deal with that certainly

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
became a part of it

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
we had a number of inefficient processes

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,440
our scans were by no means comprehensive

83
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
we also were running into issues of

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
patching vulnerabilities with secondary

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
to operational work that's a huge issue

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,159
i imagine all of you deal with it at

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,200
some point or another

88
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,959
also remediation was who was responsible

89
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
for it it also fell second place there's

90
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
a lot of things we didn't know who owned

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
a particular application as opposed to

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
who owned the device

93
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,239
these are challenges that we are running

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,599
into all over the place

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
so in 2017 the organization recognized

96
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,799
they had a problem and pulled together a

97
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,120
dedicated vulnerability management team

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
known that our company has the five guys

99
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,439
not the burger though i do agree five

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,280
guys is better than in and out

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
i will stand by that and die on this

102
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,040
hill

103
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,160
it's truth

104
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,839
when they pulled the team together they

105
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,959
pulled

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,600
a range of experience um some had app

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
admin experience some had exchange

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
experience

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
a lot of the team was fresh out of

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
college

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
didn't have a whole lot of the

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,199
experience they needed

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,560
in the environment

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
but this was the chance

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,759
at that time

116
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,840
just to put things in perspective we had

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,759
about 300 000 vulnerabilities in the

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
environment our remediation velocity was

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,880
around 60 to 65

120
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
so 2018 comes around

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
they recognize hey we should probably

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
start scanning workstations

123
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
uh

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,199
naturally

125
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
volume went up it happens when you start

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
scanning things you find more problems

127
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
our volume jumps to about 1.2 million

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,360
vulnerabilities

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
in 2018.

130
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
one of the things they did with the team

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
was time sharing

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
they took all of our five vulnerability

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
management

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,320
team

135
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
and they sent them out to work with

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,479
different teams like exchange

137
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,440
sharepoint working with app admins

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
to have some exposure to what the

139
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,199
operational environment looks like

140
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,919
great opportunity so they could see from

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,280
up close

142
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
the impact that vulnerability management

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
would have on operations

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,919
educate the team

145
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,800
fantastic idea in a perfect world

146
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
but as the last two years have shown us

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
there's nothing perfect about this world

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
in any way shape or form all five guys

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
immediately became additional admins and

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
got put on the on-call rotation

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,759
and vulnerability management became a

152
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
secondary priority to operations

153
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,000
i know none of you saw that coming right

154
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
so as we started to go into that time

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
sharing process we also started to

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
recognize something called the tail

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
scorpion's tail the tail whatever you

158
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,600
want to call it

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
if you have

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
100 000 vulnerabilities

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,880
and you resolve 65 percent of those

162
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
you now have 35 000 vulnerabilities that

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,039
are overdue

164
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,360
if you repeat the thing next month

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
now you've got 70 000 vulnerabilities

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
that are overdue

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
and there's this ever building stack

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
and it tends to come back and sting you

169
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
thus the name the scorpion's tale

170
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
that number was getting up around 40 to

171
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
50 000

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
at the time

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,479
that we decided we needed to restructure

174
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,600
the team

175
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,680
so we need to rethink how we manage

176
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,280
vulnerabilities

177
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,800
this was the opportunity i made the

178
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
mistake of raising my hand

179
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
i've been out of the air force long

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,520
enough that i forgot to not volunteer

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
and i was brought in

182
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
to sort of help restructure some of that

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
brian my colleague here in the front row

184
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,240
had the opportunity to

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
reach out to all the managers across the

186
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
company in it

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
and say any idea how we can fix this

188
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,520
my manager brought me in and said ask

189
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,759
him it's his problem

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,599
that was how i came in

191
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,120
so we finished up 2018

192
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,039
with about 1.2 million vulnerabilities

193
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,800
as i said and our remediation rate had

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,199
gotten to around 70 so we hadn't proven

195
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,199
it definitely seen improvement

196
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,280
over a much larger number of

197
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
vulnerabilities

198
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,880
65 percent over 300 000 to 70 over 1.2

199
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,840
million

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,119
is a significant improvement

201
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,880
then we're going to move into 2019

202
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,520
that's when we restructured the team

203
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
first thing we did was we reached out

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
got all the five guys and brought them

205
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,759
back home

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,120
time to come back home it's clearly not

207
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
working having everyone out there

208
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,520
no more on-call work that's not what we

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
have you structured for your life will

210
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,120
be miserable in other ways on-call is

211
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
not going to be part of it

212
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,319
when you're staying up late it's going

213
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,840
to because there's a really real threat

214
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,919
we need to patch 79 000 devices

215
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,840
that was where we went through we

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,759
started the restructure

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
first thing we did is recognize we have

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,240
40 000 vulnerabilities that are overdue

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
high and critical

220
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,479
serious issue

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
it doesn't matter how big our

222
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
environment is

223
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
40 000

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
exploitable vulnerable points on our

225
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,919
network

226
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
is still 40 000 different points

227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
it doesn't really matter how big your

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
network is because somebody's not going

229
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
to say oh they only have 5 out of a

230
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,400
thousand so

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,759
i'll leave them alone they did pretty

232
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,280
good this week

233
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,759
also incidentally

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,240
bad actors don't care what your holiday

235
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
schedule or shift rotation is

236
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,880
it's an important thing to remember

237
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
so we restructured it and pulled the

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
team together we put a big focus on

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
overdue vulnerabilities driving those

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,519
numbers down

241
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
and in the first

242
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
three months

243
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,399
we drove those numbers down by about 90

244
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
to two three months we drove those

245
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,000
numbers down about ninety percent we got

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
to under four thousand

247
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,360
was sort of the initial effort let's get

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
that big tail out of the way

249
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,839
uh get that number pushed down so that

250
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
we don't have those same kinds of issues

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
one of the next initiatives we put in

252
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,640
place and we had to design this for our

253
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
senior management

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
uh lay out how we thought we could

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
address this not only solve the problem

256
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
right now but more importantly keep it

257
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
from coming back it's one thing to put

258
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
the dumpster fire out it's another thing

259
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,000
to take the matches away from the person

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
who started in the first place

261
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
so one of the things we decided was a

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
knowledge base

263
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
we were running

264
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,519
2.4 hours per admin per week

265
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,760
we're being dedicated to

266
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
vulnerability management

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
across the company about 110 people at

268
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
the time

269
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,000
were contributing an average of 2.4

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
hours people who were successful

271
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
at managing their vulnerabilities were

272
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
spending twice that amount

273
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
we're spending almost five hours

274
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
per week

275
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,560
around vulnerability management to keep

276
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
everything on track

277
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
those are the people who are successful

278
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,880
successful is a relative phrase because

279
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,600
spending that portion of your time

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,519
doing vulnerability management is an

281
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
absolute nightmare

282
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,399
so one thing we put in place was the

283
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
knowledge base

284
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
we don't want every one of those admins

285
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,680
all 110 admins going out and researching

286
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,560
how do i fix this vulnerability

287
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
i don't want 110 people going out there

288
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,959
and downloading the same kb

289
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,240
i don't want them all developing their

290
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,079
own version of a registry

291
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
entry

292
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,360
i don't want to have all of them asking

293
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,519
for a ps exec or running their own

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,839
powershell scripts you just introduce a

295
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
number of problems

296
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,040
by having everything

297
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
autonomous and everybody can do their

298
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,279
own

299
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,560
so after we developed in the knowledge

300
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
base which reduced a lot of the research

301
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
component to this

302
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,519
we also brought in the knowledge base to

303
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
store known solutions

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
so my team took on the research

305
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,279
component role

306
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,040
so whenever someone had a vulnerability

307
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
if they had a question we're not sure

308
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,839
what to do

309
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
we would take over the role of doing

310
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
that research and chasing it for them

311
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,480
up to including contacting their vendors

312
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,399
and holding the vendors accountable the

313
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
nice thing was the vendors got to know

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,079
our team

315
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,560
and so those challenges sort of got

316
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
addressed through that this is a really

317
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,079
great presentation you all should see it

318
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
we also worked on centralization and

319
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,519
optimization

320
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,959
we do a lot of automation

321
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,920
we push i would say in a given month 90

322
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,240
to 95 percent of our patches at least

323
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
from the patch management perspective

324
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,760
are rolled out automated we have

325
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
different methods we do it all tearis

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
symantec

327
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,839
bigfix

328
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,200
ws so we have a number of methods by

329
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,959
which we handle it but it addresses 90

330
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,959
to 95

331
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,839
of our vulnerabilities

332
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,079
yes

333
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
we use them for different things

334
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
um bigfix handles some things that

335
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
alterations may not

336
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
um when we start looking at the linux

337
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
environments we have we have a heavy

338
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,160
linux environment as well as windows

339
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
um so bigfix gives us some other tools

340
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
we're also a big environment so

341
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,279
licensing wise alone bigfix comes into

342
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
play so

343
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,200
if we have bitfix please god let's use

344
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
it because it's expensive

345
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,279
right

346
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,519
what's that

347
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,360
four

348
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,320
four people on my team

349
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,079
so

350
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,120
i'll get into some of that when we'll

351
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,320
talk about it but when we're starting

352
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
this out we were at 2.4 hours per admin

353
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,040
per week across about 110 admins we're

354
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
dealing with vulnerability management

355
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,079
that number has come down drastically

356
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,600
um but we'll get into some of how that

357
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,560
happened

358
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
so through that automation process we

359
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,120
can get 90 to 95 of it handled the

360
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
problem is that still leaves that really

361
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
big chunk because that's a big number

362
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,279
whether it's 95 99 even one percent of

363
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
our network is a very very large chunk

364
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,920
it's about 800 devices

365
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,519
and 800 devices having all their

366
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,440
vulnerabilities still out there is not

367
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
something i want to explain to my board

368
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
so we started centralizing a lot of this

369
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
and my team took on a lot of the client

370
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
remediation role

371
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,120
and admins are responsible for

372
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,639
their processes

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,000
anyway so we started working on

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
centralization and optimization bringing

375
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
things into the team having centralized

376
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,320
answers

377
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,000
optimizing how we could do it best

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
what's the best method for pushing out

379
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,399
uh registry changes

380
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,880
gpos are fantastic unless you don't have

381
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,279
a really good gpo management process

382
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,959
anybody in here deal with gpos on a

383
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,279
regular basis

384
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,279
you understand the mess when there's a

385
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,760
whole bunch of little gpo changes and

386
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,839
then you look at what your entire

387
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,320
rsop is a very ugly process to look at

388
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
when you've got that many devices and

389
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
that much exception and change and

390
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,680
modification to it

391
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
so we started having a lot of success

392
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
we brought our

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
remediation

394
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
in 2019

395
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,199
was about 98.5

396
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,079
over 2.6 million devices there are 2.6

397
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,480
million vulnerabilities in 2019 by far

398
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,959
our biggest years so far

399
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
we firmly expect that to go up

400
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,399
uh yeah

401
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,600
2020.

402
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
yeah kobe did

403
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
that was fun

404
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
that was a lot of fun

405
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
we have 27 000 people in one location

406
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
one site

407
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
we are two and a half miles wide by or

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
two and a half miles long by a mile wide

409
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
physical location in newport news

410
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
we have our own police force we have our

411
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
own firefighters

412
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,959
we have all of it in one big place it's

413
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,440
one giant city

414
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
right there on the shore

415
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,360
and now we all need to be six feet apart

416
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,480
despite the fact that some of the

417
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
enclosed spaces that they weld in

418
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,519
are not six feet across

419
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,199
presents interesting challenges right

420
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
great opportunities for improvement

421
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,320
my team

422
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
recognizing that we did not contribute

423
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
anything by sitting in the office

424
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
immediately went remote my team has been

425
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,639
100 remote

426
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,440
since march 13th of 2020

427
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
and it was a fantastic test

428
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
of the systems that we had implemented

429
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
because if we can do it remote from a

430
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,120
living room

431
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
uh a few weeks ago brian actually was

432
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,560
working remote from mississippi

433
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
uh with no interruption

434
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
so it was a great test of the system we

435
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,440
put in place was this a fluke

436
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,639
where are we

437
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,000
we had

438
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,480
2.1 million vulnerabilities in 2020 it

439
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,399
was very nice because apparently the bad

440
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,240
actors were also

441
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,759
tapering off and separating from each

442
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
other nice reprieve

443
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,360
we have maintained a 98.53

444
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,279
vulnerability remediation rate

445
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,600
for the last two and a half years

446
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
just put it in perspective

447
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,279
so we're going to talk a little bit

448
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,399
about how

449
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,720
that was done

450
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,279
by the way this year we're still

451
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,839
maintaining a 98 greater than 98 and

452
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
we're on track for 2.3 million

453
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,279
vulnerabilities

454
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,560
this year

455
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,839
add all those up it's a lot more than

456
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,399
5.4 now but i swear that's what it was

457
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
inside

458
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,959
so let's talk a little bit about some of

459
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
the industry benchmarks come talk about

460
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,040
oh yes

461
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
that is within the sla our slas are for

462
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
critical vulnerabilities 21 days on

463
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
workstations 30 days on servers

464
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,160
highs are 30 days on both mediums are 60

465
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,800
lows are 120.

466
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,160
that'll help some we'll talk a little

467
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
bit about that as we get into here he

468
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,279
was asking

469
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,199
what the time cycles were what are your

470
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,920
slas that we're hitting because 98 in

471
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,040
six months isn't nearly as impressive

472
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,079
um

473
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,199
let's talk about some of the industry

474
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
benchmarks that we're trying to find

475
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,480
because we're struggling through this

476
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,039
trying to find out what we should target

477
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,599
this is not an area of cyber security

478
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,119
that people are really eager to talk

479
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,919
about

480
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
not many companies want to say

481
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,760
we patched 58 of the problems we had

482
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
particularly when you're a dod

483
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,679
contractor making things like planes and

484
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,280
ships you know

485
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,599
uh the navy there are people in the navy

486
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,200
who will tell you they have

487
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
zero vulnerabilities

488
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,559
true story

489
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,280
so

490
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
we finally got some data around 2019.

491
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,559
kenna was the first one that came out

492
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,760
with it

493
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,360
and i have to read this one here because

494
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
i'm not going to remember the exact clue

495
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
kenneth said investment transportation

496
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
and oil gas energy

497
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
were the best at remediation

498
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
that they led the way with the shortest

499
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
time to close 75

500
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,280
the big report was called prioritization

501
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,360
to remediation relief

502
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
uh you can look it up do cannot

503
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,600
prioritization you'll see it they said

504
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
at a benchmark of 75

505
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,240
of exploitable vulnerabilities oil gas

506
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,919
energy investment and transportation

507
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
were the best at it because they were

508
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,360
hitting 75 percent in as low as 112 days

509
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
stats since then edge scan has been

510
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
talking about it here and edge can did a

511
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
release a report earlier this year

512
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,840
and they said the average

513
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,360
time to remediate

514
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,640
is 60.3 days

515
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
and

516
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,200
you know

517
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
ntt data to all of their customers

518
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
reported that vulnerability remediation

519
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
this year and 2021 went down from

520
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,559
january to june originally at 49 within

521
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,280
the 30-day time frame it is as of june

522
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,039
it was at 38

523
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,120
of vulnerabilities across the industries

524
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,880
across cyber security to all of nct

525
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,320
data's customers

526
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,480
38 of critical vulnerable critical and

527
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
high vulnerabilities are remediated

528
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
within their sla

529
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,879
it's problematic

530
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,919
so we wanted to start talking about all

531
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,280
this is to tell you

532
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
we developed the framework

533
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
and it works

534
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
one of the big challenges you have is if

535
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,480
you look at the nist framework

536
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,960
or if you look at cobit or owasp or fill

537
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,120
in the blanks right they all have risk

538
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
management frameworks and talk a great

539
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
about how

540
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,400
to take care of your risk if you go and

541
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
look at those and dig really deep you

542
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
know you have to a word search

543
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
for vulnerability or remediation or

544
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,679
mitigation

545
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,280
what they tell you is make sure you

546
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
remediate or mitigate your

547
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
vulnerabilities

548
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,080
that is the official answer

549
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,039
make sure you take care of it

550
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,400
that wasn't quite enough of a framework

551
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
for actually figuring out how to do it

552
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,679
and if you're at a company trying to

553
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,919
implement vulnerability management how

554
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,080
do you do it how do you show your boss

555
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,919
this is the road map

556
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,039
for building a program that's

557
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,880
sustainable

558
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
so we took our framework started

559
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,559
polishing it

560
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,000
broke it into six domains

561
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
and it's my position that if you

562
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,039
address each of these six domains in a

563
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,120
way that is appropriate for the risk

564
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,080
that you are exposed to at your company

565
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,760
you will be taken care of and you will

566
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,440
have a good handle

567
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,679
on your vulnerability management

568
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,840
that comes with a caveat that

569
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,799
as you have a higher risk exposure

570
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,799
as you have a larger network larger

571
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,039
environment more unique settings that

572
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,960
complexity comes up

573
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
obviously i cannot get away with a

574
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,120
spreadsheet for managing vulnerabilities

575
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,760
but there are many companies who can

576
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,960
so the first domain is asset management

577
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,280
it is the number one most important

578
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,400
thing in cyber security hands down no

579
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
question if you don't know what devices

580
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
you have

581
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,159
you cannot secure them

582
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,840
if you cannot tell me this device

583
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,000
belongs on my network you cannot prove

584
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
that it's not a rogue device

585
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,799
so you must know what's on your network

586
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
if you don't have good asset management

587
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,480
stop go back figure that out

588
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,559
period it is the foundation for cyber

589
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,080
security period you don't know the

590
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,919
devices you have no luck

591
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,240
that includes in the cloud

592
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
if you don't know what devices have been

593
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,039
spun up if you've got something that

594
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
automatically pops instances up or pops

595
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
slices up because we've suddenly hit

596
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
this demand and you don't realize that

597
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,679
it's popped up that's important

598
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,120
also in the cloud if you're spinning

599
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,640
something up off of a golden image it

600
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,880
only has the updates that were in place

601
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,280
until that golden image was made

602
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,880
if you haven't upgraded your old golden

603
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
image from since six months ago

604
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,120
you're going to have a problem

605
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,559
all problems we've actually seen

606
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,600
there are three different types of asset

607
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
lists

608
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
you have your static one

609
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
which most people forget about

610
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
and the best or the best part of your

611
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,280
organization that knows what your static

612
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,480
asset list

613
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,400
is actually finance

614
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,760
no matter how it came about whether it

615
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
came out through shadow i.t somebody

616
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,880
doing it on an expense

617
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
on their own personal debit card whether

618
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,640
it came through a purchasing program

619
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
if money was spent for it finance knows

620
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400
about it has a record of it somewhere

621
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,080
and they've been doing asset management

622
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,480
for a very very long time

623
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
so we have our static one

624
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
the next step is our dynamic one dynamic

625
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,080
lists

626
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
you have asset management throughout

627
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,919
your organization

628
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,320
your antivirus has a list of devices you

629
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,159
have in your environment active

630
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,840
directory's got a list that it has in

631
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
your environment you have agents all

632
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
over the place reporting back home

633
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
saying here's all the assets i found

634
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,679
they're not all the same

635
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,880
so

636
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,320
how many people are dealing with asset

637
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,280
management

638
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
in here

639
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,679
same people keep your hands up

640
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320
how many of you reconcile your asset

641
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
lists

642
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,840
between all the different devices

643
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,520
like it's less

644
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,360
so once you reconcile across all of

645
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
those it helps operations too because

646
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,000
the person who's running macabee

647
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,679
or active directory it would be

648
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,120
beneficial for them to be able to go out

649
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,640
and troubleshoot

650
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,000
why they're not getting that agent

651
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
reporting why is it not showing up

652
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,919
and that's some of the challenges they

653
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,280
run into

654
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
that's a pretty important one

655
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
when you get all of that reconciled that

656
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,520
becomes your working

657
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,440
inventory you should be able to look at

658
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,120
all those dynamics to reconcile this

659
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,200
from all of your dynamic inventories

660
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,559
balance that against your static

661
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
inventory and you should be able to

662
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,039
account for it these 20 laptops we know

663
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,279
are in storage waiting for deployment

664
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,360
when we roll out

665
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,760
the next windows me

666
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,919
we know those are coming

667
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,000
so that becomes your working list

668
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,120
and it's important to know the

669
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
difference a list of assets is not

670
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,720
everything

671
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,840
it can be as simple as an excel

672
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,400
spreadsheet

673
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,880
if you have a company if you have

674
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
100 to 500 devices 500 devices is really

675
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
the top

676
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,960
of what you can effectively manage

677
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,559
through a spreadsheet

678
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,799
truthfully

679
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,360
but you absolutely can manage up to a

680
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
thousand devices that way there's a

681
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,159
point where it's just not efficient

682
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,520
anymore and you cost too much money

683
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,600
to be sorting to be hitting the page

684
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,480
down

685
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,679
going through a spreadsheet for that

686
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,200
much time

687
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
but if you're standing up a program and

688
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,720
you need to get that in place and you

689
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
didn't prove those numbers a spreadsheet

690
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,919
will work

691
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,760
at a minimum for vulnerability

692
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,520
management

693
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,039
you may need a lot of other information

694
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,120
on your assets for other reasons for

695
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
vulnerability management

696
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
these are the four things you need

697
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
what do we have

698
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,720
right what devices do we have

699
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,559
in our environment

700
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,640
what is installed on those devices

701
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
who owns what is installed in those

702
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,760
devices

703
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
because it's different the person who's

704
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
responsible for

705
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,799
the laptop

706
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,559
may not be the person who's responsible

707
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,799
for office

708
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,080
not to mention if they're using

709
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,880
something like visual studio nobody

710
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,080
probably has been assigned the

711
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,640
responsibility for the sql server that

712
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,240
visual studio installs without

713
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
mentioning it to itself

714
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,000
solves its own and it has patches that

715
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
are due too

716
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
so that's the important part is who owns

717
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,000
the device as well as who owns the stuff

718
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
installed on the device it's a

719
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,880
many-to-many relationship it's not an

720
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,320
easy one

721
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,000
but it's incredibly important

722
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,640
now we're going to talk about

723
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,200
administrative controls

724
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,799
core areas come from legal and

725
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,039
regulatory requirements

726
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,320
depending on what your industry is

727
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,520
it's him he's moving

728
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,039
you may have contractual obligations

729
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,880
with your customers

730
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,480
uh and you may have work and you should

731
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
have organizational policy that backs

732
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,480
some of that up

733
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,520
you want to set policies and procedures

734
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,400
that reflect operational reality

735
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,000
you may want

736
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,360
to have every device in your

737
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,360
organization patched within 48 hours

738
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
if you need to test patches for four

739
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,559
days it's not going to happen

740
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,720
that's reality

741
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,600
those goals should be a stretch

742
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,960
a little bit beyond what you currently

743
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,679
do

744
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,799
a little bit of stretch but they should

745
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,720
also be achievable because you'll be

746
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
able to get some optimization out of

747
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
this process

748
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,840
and you also are going to have more

749
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,159
complex requirements with more resources

750
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
more operating systems you have the more

751
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,320
flavors of operating systems you have

752
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,159
and variations in it all of that needs

753
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919
to become more complex speaks to the

754
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,919
conversation about bigfix

755
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,679
you know what our environmental needs

756
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,520
are we have everything

757
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,799
everything from

758
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,000
uh ultra spark stations sun os

759
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
linux windows you name it

760
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,440
it should also reflect the risk exposure

761
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,080
of your organization

762
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,200
if you

763
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,720
are a high profile target as we are

764
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,919
you need to have tighter slas

765
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,840
and you need to be hitting a higher goal

766
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
those slash

767
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,399
if you are a mom and pop shop

768
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,399
with 10 devices

769
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,520
that no one's heard of no web presence

770
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,200
maybe not the same kind of standard is

771
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,840
in place really should be driven

772
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,080
by a risk assessment and what your

773
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,439
threat profile looks like

774
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
so that's where we wrap around risk

775
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,919
exposure and doing that assessment it's

776
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,440
probably the most important thing you

777
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
can do in your organization

778
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
with the exception of asset management

779
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,960
that's more important

780
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
but really understanding your risk

781
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,039
here's the big one you should have a

782
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,279
process for accepting the risk

783
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,279
there may be systems

784
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,200
that you flat out can't patch or there's

785
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
a configuration which is considered

786
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,039
vulnerable but will fundamentally break

787
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,360
your business

788
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,880
you don't get extra points for shutting

789
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,960
the business down but being secure

790
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,520
being in business is itself a risk

791
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,440
you need to accept some of those facts

792
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,600
and you need to have a process for it

793
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
because

794
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,520
just because you are not willing to sign

795
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
off does not mean that you are not

796
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,039
accepting the risk

797
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,440
you accept risk by allowing it to exist

798
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,120
on your network

799
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,640
the second you're aware of it and you

800
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
allow it to remain whether someone

801
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
signed off on it

802
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,039
what i got really busy your company is

803
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,880
accepting the risk

804
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,279
whether they intended to or not

805
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,720
and that's important factor and it's a

806
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
big one that you have the conversations

807
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,559
with management with the c-suite is this

808
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,080
is a real risk

809
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,360
this is also a place where you can

810
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,200
leverage financing again because this is

811
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
a world they deal with all the time

812
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,559
let's talk a little about detection the

813
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,279
complexity of your detection scheme

814
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,120
should scope with your risk exposure

815
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,840
like everything else

816
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,240
if you are a small company and you don't

817
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
have an i.t staff it's one person who

818
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,240
also sweeps um it may be going to the 10

819
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,159
devices you have and looking at them are

820
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,279
you patched

821
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,360
right check and see if they're patched

822
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,919
it's fundamental it's basic it does work

823
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,520
it's not the fastest thing in the world

824
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,760
doesn't scale well but it will let you

825
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
know where you are

826
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,200
if you are a large organization you may

827
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
have multiple wsus servers in different

828
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
locations across the world

829
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,840
pushing those patches out

830
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,039
and we'll also talk about config

831
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,760
management a little bit

832
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,200
you should be at least as frequent as

833
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
your sla requirement i've seen this one

834
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,159
a lot

835
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,760
if you have a requirement that we have

836
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,880
to patch

837
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,360
within seven days

838
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
and you only check to see if it's

839
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,080
patched every 30.

840
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,960
either in amazing compliance

841
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,440
or not at all you have no idea

842
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
so whatever your detection scheme is

843
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,799
whether it's someone walking around and

844
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,080
looking at them all

845
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,679
or you have automated scanning happening

846
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,120
on a daily basis your detection scheme

847
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,320
has to be

848
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,559
at least as often as your slas require

849
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,039
the patches to be implemented

850
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,039
start with patching seriously

851
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,159
patching

852
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,679
takes care of so much of it there are

853
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,240
configuration problems that patching has

854
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
addressed it's not just software bugs or

855
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
vulnerabilities introduced in that

856
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,679
direction

857
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,320
patching is your most important point of

858
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,159
vulnerability management especially when

859
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,559
you're starting a system up

860
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,279
also this one's critical

861
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,360
just because you made the patch

862
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,880
available

863
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,440
or you pushed the patch

864
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,039
to devices

865
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,480
does not mean it's successfully

866
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,320
installed

867
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,000
you'd be amazed the number of times you

868
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,799
hear

869
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,399
we made that patch available a week ago

870
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,000
okay how many devices didn't have enough

871
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
hard drive space

872
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,360
how many devices got shut down and

873
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
haven't been turned on since

874
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
it's important to follow up caleb talked

875
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,360
about it in the last conversation in the

876
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,880
last presentation

877
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,440
verification matters validate

878
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,519
that what you tried to do had the

879
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,960
intended effect

880
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,799
um how many people dealt with hive

881
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,799
nightmare

882
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,120
here in the last couple months

883
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,600
hive nightmare perfect example microsoft

884
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,200
pushed i think three patches over the

885
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,600
course of a week

886
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,880
still not sure any of them actually

887
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
worked

888
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
it ended up being a registry entry you

889
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,799
had to do on your own on the back side

890
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,200
and cross your fingers and hope right

891
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,360
so verify that the patch fixed what you

892
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,440
was supposed to fix

893
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,039
patching is more than microsoft apple

894
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,559
google and adobe

895
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,000
you'd be amazed how many people have

896
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,399
bought something from a vendor or our

897
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,519
vendors out here they got this great

898
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,440
appliance not paying attention to the

899
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,360
fact that it's running apache

900
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,320
and now they need to make sure the

901
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,279
apache on the appliance underlying

902
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,960
the perfect system

903
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,120
also needs to be patched

904
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,880
anyone who dealt with java over the last

905
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,559
couple years

906
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,919
making sure you have a purchase process

907
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,480
for java

908
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
remember that asset list remember how to

909
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,159
have all the things that are installed

910
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,120
on it

911
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,640
that's how you know what

912
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,519
to

913
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,679
dispatch

914
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,279
it comes in handy

915
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,200
what's that

916
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
i understand but i'm nervous

917
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,000
prioritization and mitigation these two

918
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,519
swords go hand in hand

919
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,480
prioritization boils down really simply

920
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,360
fix whatever presents the most risk

921
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,320
first

922
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
it's a fundamental concept but it's

923
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,919
amazing how often it gets missed one of

924
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,919
the big challenges right now

925
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,880
is

926
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,399
vendors all over the place are talking

927
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,679
to the idea of prioritized only five

928
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,200
percent of these are actively being

929
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,840
exploited so focus on the top ten

930
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
percent

931
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,840
what they're missing in that

932
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,279
conversation there's a number of

933
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,880
vulnerabilities that started off as a

934
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
low or a medium

935
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,840
until someone figured out how to

936
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
weaponize it

937
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
you can be on the back side of that and

938
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,519
having to patch all of those devices now

939
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,519
that it's critical but if you patched it

940
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,360
when it was a medium priority

941
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,679
you wouldn't have that same issue

942
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,840
if that makes

943
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,480
sense

944
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,159
three components to evaluating risk when

945
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,360
you're looking at it trying to boil it

946
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,480
all down

947
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,679
the severity or threat of the

948
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,760
vulnerability itself this one's a very

949
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,679
mean vulnerability it likes to tear

950
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,880
things up

951
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,039
mitigation for the device

952
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,960
if the device has a windows xp box

953
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,279
sitting on the outside edge

954
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,200
and it's got a medium vulnerability on

955
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
it i'm much more concerned about that

956
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,279
one than the critical vulnerability it's

957
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,720
air gap sitting in a vault where no

958
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,559
person can get to

959
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,360
so

960
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,919
the device may have mitigation itself

961
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,000
and then the asset valuation how much

962
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,399
effort are you going to push into

963
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,320
fixing vulnerabilities on a system that

964
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,799
has no value to the organization it may

965
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,039
be better just to shut the device off

966
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,360
certainly a possibility

967
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
goes to that idea you may have

968
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
mitigations that are already present

969
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,039
when they push out a vulnerability

970
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,360
and they allow for different

971
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,679
ratings cvss ratings

972
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,440
they aren't taking your network into

973
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
account

974
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,639
they're not looking at whether you have

975
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
two-factor authentication how your

976
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,000
administrative accounts are structured

977
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,440
because you all have your privileged

978
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,320
accounts

979
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,639
separated used only for one specific

980
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,639
thing none of them are shared i'm sure

981
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,520
that's true right

982
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,000
so you may have mitigations that

983
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,760
block some of the threat of these and

984
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
they aren't as high a priority others

985
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,000
may be a higher priority

986
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,639
cbss is a great start

987
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,239
but it's not necessarily a complete view

988
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,079
for your team you really need to

989
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
understand your vulnerabilities that's

990
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,199
one of the things that we found with

991
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,599
that centralization is that our team's

992
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,560
job

993
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,399
is to know understand and love the

994
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
vulnerabilities themselves understand

995
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,399
how they work what makes them tick

996
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,359
and how to stop them

997
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,119
don't rush to prioritize away the risk

998
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,639
it's really easy to get caught in that

999
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,839
loop of

1000
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,599
we only have five percent that are being

1001
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,520
actively exploited we only have 10

1002
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,880
percent that are really considered

1003
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,040
critical

1004
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,480
those prioritization schemes are

1005
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,320
fantastic for helping you decide what to

1006
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
go after and if you absolutely

1007
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,800
positively can't go after everything and

1008
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,040
there's no chance or even half of it it

1009
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
helps you get the most important ones

1010
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,359
first

1011
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,440
the goal is still to remediate all the

1012
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,720
vulnerabilities

1013
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,160
you can't lose sight of that and that's

1014
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,079
a big challenge in the industry right

1015
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,359
now

1016
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,000
so let's talk about remediation

1017
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,839
know your operational model

1018
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,280
our operational model is app-centric

1019
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,720
the app admin

1020
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,560
is the top of the stack they own the

1021
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,000
application and they're responsible for

1022
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
everything under it

1023
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,960
responsible for the server architecture

1024
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
they're responsible for the supporting

1025
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
software

1026
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,760
our

1027
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
our

1028
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,480
distribution team will make sure that

1029
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,400
they have access to the patch through

1030
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,720
wsus but making sure it gets installed

1031
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,960
on that system is the app admins job

1032
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,280
that's their role

1033
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,480
but that may not be true in your

1034
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,400
organization so it's important to know

1035
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,599
who is responsible for pushing patches

1036
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,680
to your devices

1037
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,760
then you get into gpos who's responsible

1038
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,839
for pushing your

1039
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,119
gpos it's probably not the app admin who

1040
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,960
owns this particular server

1041
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,640
so what's that process look like what's

1042
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,560
that coordination look at all those

1043
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
kinds of variations how about device or

1044
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,880
registry configurations

1045
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
could have a different touch a few linux

1046
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
devices app admin may not have it

1047
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,240
because app admin doesn't necessarily

1048
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,320
need to have root access

1049
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
you may have a linux team as we do who

1050
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,520
handles root access and they handle that

1051
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
job

1052
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,560
so know what your operational model

1053
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
looks like

1054
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,119
automation fender foe

1055
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,079
erase sailboats for fun one of my that's

1056
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,320
what i do for entertainment because i'm

1057
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,400
a masochist

1058
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,599
one of the things you learn in there the

1059
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,000
only thing the only thing worse than

1060
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,079
sailing in the wrong direction on a race

1061
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,079
course just sailing in the wrong

1062
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,040
direction

1063
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,680
really fast

1064
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,240
it's true here too

1065
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,839
we have to be care automation is an

1066
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,359
amazing tool

1067
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,960
it's an amazing knife you can use it for

1068
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,119
anything it can also cut you badly

1069
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,040
so be careful before you jump all the

1070
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,720
way on the bandwagon

1071
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,160
we had an incident where we had an

1072
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,560
intern or sorry co-op

1073
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,920
who was amazing

1074
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
fantastic loved him

1075
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,680
and he developed a script

1076
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,240
that would push patches

1077
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,240
didn't have any error handling in it

1078
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,320
it was a fun conversation

1079
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,520
with our

1080
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,240
sock guys it was not fun

1081
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,720
in your environment where are the warts

1082
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,040
you've got that legacy application that

1083
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
you know

1084
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
is a nightmare

1085
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,760
you can't patch it no one wants to touch

1086
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,800
it because they're afraid if they turn

1087
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,119
that device off it might not turn on

1088
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,960
again it's also the one that the entire

1089
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,280
company's business model is based on

1090
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
right entire business model the

1091
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,200
company's built on that one rubber band

1092
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,720
and we can't stop it long enough to put

1093
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,320
a new one on so we've got this running

1094
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,640
process that happens

1095
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,839
legacy systems are often the most

1096
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,920
critical to your business

1097
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,760
and are also the most vulnerable

1098
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,920
just because they no longer release

1099
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,480
patches for it does not mean

1100
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,640
it's now secure

1101
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,440
quite the opposite

1102
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,599
and then one of the big questions that's

1103
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,280
going on right now

1104
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,640
you've optimized this you've got it

1105
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,200
perfect you've got a 14 day sla in place

1106
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,720
you've built your team out for it we can

1107
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
get everything rolled out

1108
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,079
it's a stretch but we can do it and

1109
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,079
we've really built it

1110
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,760
now a patch comes out out of band and

1111
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,880
has to be installed within 48 hours

1112
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,720
your team probably cannot do that

1113
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,880
effectively certainly not multiple times

1114
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
as we've seen in the last few months

1115
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,200
in the course of a month it was august

1116
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,880
we had three

1117
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
three out of bands or three emergency

1118
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
patches that came out

1119
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,599
in the same month

1120
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,760
your team can't turn around like that if

1121
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,800
they are dedicating that much effort

1122
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,119
to pushing an emergency

1123
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,440
they are not doing other operational

1124
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,800
work

1125
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,720
this goes into our risk profile right

1126
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,480
know what that risk is

1127
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,000
i'm suggesting that you treat it as

1128
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,160
incident response

1129
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,640
right here's a threat to our environment

1130
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,000
treat it through incident response

1131
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,680
triage it the same as incident response

1132
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,599
run it through that same process you're

1133
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,000
gonna get more buy-in for management

1134
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,880
you're going to have people who

1135
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,720
understand the severity of it better

1136
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
this is not just your normal monthly

1137
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,560
patch this is an issue that needs to be

1138
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,000
dealt with something to consider

1139
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,359
last we're talking about metrics and

1140
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,560
reporting

1141
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,400
here's a very basic metrics of what you

1142
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,280
need

1143
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,160
what did you find how many

1144
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,839
how many of those were due

1145
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,680
within this month just because you found

1146
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,839
them last month does not mean that

1147
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,000
they're due in the same month depending

1148
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
on when they were found

1149
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
how many of the ones that were due

1150
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,079
actually got done

1151
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,920
don't hit that remediation velocity and

1152
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,160
most importantly what's left because we

1153
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
don't want to get that big stack again

1154
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,480
we don't want the tail to show up

1155
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
different audiences have different

1156
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,079
interests

1157
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,079
give them different metrics

1158
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,240
senior management is concerned about

1159
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,960
risk what is our risk exposure how much

1160
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,280
residual risk do we have what kind of

1161
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,200
risk are we facing you'll hear the same

1162
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,880
thing repeated in all kinds of different

1163
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,920
sentences

1164
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,520
that's what senior management cares

1165
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,640
about

1166
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,400
that's it

1167
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,079
middle management is concerned about

1168
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,000
efficiency

1169
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,359
how long did it take us to do this

1170
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,680
how many hours did i spend i need more

1171
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
resources can you make this take less

1172
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,800
time

1173
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,640
those are critical role critical pieces

1174
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,040
of information for middle management

1175
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,359
the person who's patching does not give

1176
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,280
a about either one of them

1177
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
the person patching is what do i have to

1178
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,640
do next

1179
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
what's my list what are the 10 items so

1180
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,480
i can prioritize them get them done and

1181
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,000
not talk about these for another week

1182
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,440
so give those people the metrics they

1183
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,400
need it's important to separate those

1184
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,240
remember we created all those slas back

1185
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,119
when we're doing administrative controls

1186
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,800
report on those

1187
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,480
those are the ones that your company

1188
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,160
found to be important

1189
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
make sure you're doing those and when

1190
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,280
you have that last stack for us you know

1191
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,119
0.68 last month we had 99.32

1192
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,800
in october

1193
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,520
0.68 first email i got this morning was

1194
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,880
asked me what was the residual

1195
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,280
what was in that stack that was left

1196
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,960
uh and being able to speak to those know

1197
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,560
what it is don't have to go into depth

1198
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,760
the people who are asking won't

1199
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,440
understand what you're saying

1200
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,960
but be able to speak to it at least the

1201
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,280
surface level

1202
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,319
so this is where we are we constantly

1203
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,800
are looking through the six domains

1204
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,880
constantly reviewing them

1205
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,319
we are at 98.52 since we implemented

1206
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,880
this at the end of 2018.

1207
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,640
all team members have been remote since

1208
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,040
march 13th 2020.

1209
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,920
i think the model speaks for itself

1210
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,160
we've been successful with it

1211
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
and invite others to look at it

1212
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,240
the slides including the first half has

1213
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
amazing slides in it so please go

1214
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,720
download it

1215
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,760
open it up for questions

1216
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,079
yes

1217
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,640
this question was what would it take to

1218
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,160
get from 98.52 to 99

1219
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,400
a time machine

1220
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,480
we had an incident in

1221
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,880
july with a period in july where there

1222
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,000
were some exceptions it didn't happen

1223
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,319
that we dropped to

1224
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:45,839
89.68 in july

1225
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,560
so

1226
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,480
you know averages

1227
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,599
are brutal

1228
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,480
um we've been maintaining over 98 for a

1229
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,760
long time

1230
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,839
part of the challenges is what gets left

1231
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,160
over as a residual

1232
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,640
who owns it and how much of a threat is

1233
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,319
it

1234
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,720
msxml

1235
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,319
it's out there it's not supported

1236
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,440
anymore

1237
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,200
how much exposure is there's not an

1238
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,319
explodable exploit to it

1239
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,160
how much threat does it present and so

1240
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,760
chasing some of those

1241
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,800
that last two percent gets very very

1242
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,640
very expensive

1243
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,800
i keep referring to finance

1244
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,720
finance will absolutely tell you you

1245
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,400
don't spend a thousand dollars chasing a

1246
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,160
missing 50.

1247
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,560
so but it depends on your organization's

1248
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,920
risk perspective

1249
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,640
that same conversation can happen at 80

1250
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,280
how worth it is to chase the last 20

1251
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,880
and depending on your organization it

1252
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,839
might not be worth it

1253
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,760
so we tend to continue remediating we

1254
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,680
actually track for that

1255
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,880
we actually track of what's overdue

1256
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,319
what do we do so my team actually

1257
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,599
focuses not only on what's due this

1258
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,839
month but also lowering the overdue rate

1259
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,599
so we continue to track those to closure

1260
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,040
we don't just leave them hanging out

1261
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,640
forever it just it didn't get done in

1262
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,359
the 30 days

1263
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,640
yes

1264
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
no i would say that we're a lot faster

1265
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,880
than that some of them are 33 days

1266
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
there are very few things that we have

1267
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,720
hanging out i would say we probably have

1268
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,119
less than 100 that hang out

1269
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,720
that kind of duration and those

1270
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,079
typically

1271
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,920
go towards we're constantly doing

1272
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,800
discovery you know on our network here's

1273
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,480
this little enclave or shadow i.t that

1274
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,040
we just discovered identifying who owns

1275
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,400
the device

1276
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,280
um

1277
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,599
ot you know ics and ot

1278
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,440
this area that how do we want to address

1279
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,599
this we don't want to rush

1280
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,119
to fix it because sometimes the

1281
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,480
medicine's worse than the disease

1282
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
but yeah not a whole lot

1283
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,440
that with 2.3 million i would say we're

1284
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,800
less than 100

1285
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,480
that actually have any kind of duration

1286
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,200
and we have a story on all of them

1287
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,919
yes yes

1288
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,160
never is

1289
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,079
the best funded cyber security program

1290
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,280
starts the day after the breach

1291
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,920
one of the best ways i've found to drive

1292
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,319
it is find other people who it values if

1293
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,200
you can sell the value to other people

1294
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,760
you can build that sort of inertia

1295
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,440
right ops is going to have a lot of

1296
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,200
opportunity for it

1297
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,240
again

1298
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,800
finance is your best friend

1299
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,400
if you can help finance figure out what

1300
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
that leasing process is so since we have

1301
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,920
asset management we know where

1302
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,440
everything is who owns it where it's

1303
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
sitting i can now turn my lease stuff in

1304
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,200
faster and we can get a bigger it's not

1305
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,880
going to cost us that extra six months

1306
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,720
of overage costs which is always more

1307
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,440
expensive than the actual leases

1308
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,040
but that's key to it is to actually

1309
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,960
identify other people who would benefit

1310
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,800
from it

1311
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,040
and build that ground swell up

1312
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,520
but honestly if you don't have that

1313
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,839
buy-in or can't get that buy-in

1314
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,359
it's going to be a struggle

1315
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,119
but that's what i'm saying suggest tying

1316
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,640
in with finance because they do risk

1317
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,760
management

1318
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,920
and the cfo gets listened to even if the

1319
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,680
cso doesn't

1320
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,680
yes

1321
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,079
so the question was when working with

1322
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,839
other departments

1323
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,440
who does the heavy lifting how much of a

1324
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,560
partnership is it is 82 80 20 you 2080

1325
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,079
you

1326
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,880
do not let them see your secret sauce

1327
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,319
i find that it is huge i want to make

1328
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,400
that as open a partnership as possible i

1329
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,640
want them to look at me as an ally

1330
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,160
but i'm also a big fan i want to make

1331
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,480
sure that what i'm doing

1332
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,280
is not making their job harder

1333
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,119
that's the key towards working better

1334
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,880
with them

1335
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,160
has been my experience

1336
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,920
so hope that helps

1337
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,319
yes sir

1338
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,520
hold on hold on

1339
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,119
yes

1340
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,960
question is you mentioned legacy in the

1341
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,640
slides how do you deal with proprietary

1342
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,240
software that's end of life

1343
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,200
easy answer get rid of it um

1344
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,440
it depends on what it is so the question

1345
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,880
is is how critical is this to the

1346
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,440
business right

1347
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,280
and you get interesting arguments on

1348
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,079
that

1349
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,960
we can't get rid of this it is the most

1350
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,839
important piece of software we have

1351
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,000
right okay what happens when it crashes

1352
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,440
what happens when the code gets corrupt

1353
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,559
can't get the installer any more

1354
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,319
companies to close

1355
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,200
you know um tabletop exercises are a

1356
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
great opportunity for that

1357
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,960
document things have happened do

1358
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,800
different kinds of testing different

1359
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
kinds of use cases do tabletops around

1360
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,559
it this has now gone down what is your

1361
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,319
process for fixing it

1362
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,040
um virtualization comes in handy

1363
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,160
you know actually having an image of the

1364
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,319
system the last known good state

1365
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,160
if it's that critical i'd be doing it

1366
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,480
almost hourly

1367
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,160
right because i need to know how much am

1368
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,599
i going to lose when this system goes

1369
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,920
down is no longer workable

1370
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,440
so i think it really depends on what the

1371
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,480
application is in your

1372
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,160
environment yes

1373
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,920
okay this last question here i will stay

1374
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,680
after if anybody has questions i'll step

1375
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,680
outside but

1376
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,000
okay yes

1377
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,040
question is what ratio is authenticated

1378
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,960
scans and how is it possible to reduce

1379
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,640
your qa cycle

1380
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,000
qa cycle comes down to repeatability

1381
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,839
having a process for it

1382
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,520
to actually lay it out

1383
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,680
there is a point where there's no fast

1384
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,119
answer

1385
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,760
to getting there

1386
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,079
put it in perspective we scan

1387
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,680
every device

1388
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,200
every port

1389
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,400
every plug-in

1390
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,359
so we say 65 000 ports on every single

1391
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,559
device we have

1392
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,000
across the board

1393
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,079
so it's very comprehensive

1394
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,880
um the qa cycle

1395
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,240
i'm sorry i was just gonna go 20 minutes

1396
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,599
thank you all i apologize if you have

1397
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,240
questions i'll be outside
