thankful for that

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,560
um we're gonna do a discussion around

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,360
cmmc and i'm not gonna put myself out as

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
a cmmc

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
expert right

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,320
i

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
my background

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
operations management

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
in the early days of iso 9000

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,399
worked with that and with manufacturers

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,960
and later as a technology leader

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,799
i did a little bit of investigation iso

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,520
27000. one of the things about those

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,560
standards

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
that um i

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
first of all they're global so the power

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,479
of them is is tremendous but

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,758
we were early in in iso 9000 let's say

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,080
and the early standard

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
was was here and then over the years

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
they raised

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
everybody up over time

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,879
and one of the things that really i

59
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,520
thought was interesting with cmmc is

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,959
wherever you are in your journey i mean

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
if well back to iso i mean if

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,879
if

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,840
i had waited 10 years to jump in

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
you know the standard was up here it's

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
already a much higher bar it was harder

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
right

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
whereas with cmmc

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
that um it's wherever you are in your

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,400
journey you kind of map a course and and

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
you you know progress over time so that

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
was one of the things i'm saying wow

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,720
that's great you know so i was excited

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,319
about it and like i wanna i wanna share

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
that with others um and so we're gonna

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
be talking a little bit about in order

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
to um kind of paint that picture i'm

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,239
gonna have to get a little bit into the

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,720
the details of the standard and and i

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
hope that's okay with everybody but

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
anyway that's um a little bit about our

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
our conversation and and how it became

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,519
to be so

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,760
um

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,239
and with that introduction you get my

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,360
point about

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,959
so cmsc is a requirement coming from the

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,440
department of defense and um

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,200
and so i wanted to make this

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
conversation applicable to everybody and

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,560
and so it's that whole maturity model

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
concept that is what is intriguing about

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,159
it and that's why you should care

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,480
so um a little bit of background i mean

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
i i i work for cherry becker cherry

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
beckert is a public accounting company

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
and if you'd asked me 20 years ago if i

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,519
was going to be working with a bunch of

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,120
accountants

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,239
i would have said

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,400
no i don't think so but

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
what is really great about working at

102
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
trey bakker is and i'm not trying to you

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
know this is not a sales stage at all

104
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
but um

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,640
there's an intense passion for for

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
people's businesses and and helping

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,239
people's businesses and helping to

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,760
manage risk and um and so terry beckert

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
um if i weren't in the richmond

110
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,640
community i probably wouldn't have heard

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,879
of them but um they are the 25th largest

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,799
uh public accounting company in in the

113
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
country

114
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,320
let's see

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,798
two that's 25

116
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,079
yeah so

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,199
southeast u.s mostly but we're growing

118
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,720
where we've just

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
bought businesses in in california so

120
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,520
we're kind of spreading out and

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
there's three primary sections in any

122
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,759
public accounting company you typically

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,800
have tax you have audit and assurance

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
and then you have advisory and so um

125
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,320
i'm part of the advisory business

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
and

127
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,520
while i don't

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
go out and and do cyber specifically

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
i have that background

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
i'm in cio advisory service that's my

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
role is is to come in and help companies

132
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,840
with uh with information technology

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,479
strategy and and moving moving them

134
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,520
forward

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,080
we're organized around verticals

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,120
so

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
where i like to spend a lot of my time

138
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
is is industrial given my background so

139
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
a little bit about me

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,520
that mbb it just it's master black belt

141
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,800
i spent quite a lot of my career in

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
process improvement you know it's not

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
the karate type i used to get that joke

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,320
a lot you know it's like you're a black

145
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
belt

146
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,440
but

147
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
it just means that i spent a lot of time

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,520
helping companies with process

149
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,479
improvement

150
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,000
and

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,960
so the cism that's why i'm up here

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
because i've i'm earning

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
i'm earning cpes i've got requirements

154
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,199
around that but

155
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,240
in my past over 20 years of industrial

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
experience

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,440
16 years at ge tredegger is a richmond

158
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,919
company i spent 10 years there

159
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,319
six years in financial services

160
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,400
and also a couple years in wholesale

161
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
distribution so i've

162
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,000
moved around in different industries and

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,919
it was always that process improvement

164
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,319
uh element that helped me do that so you

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,639
know you go in you ask questions and and

166
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
there's a method of helping companies

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
understand the processes and and

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
opportunities for improvement and that's

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000

place aren't we um

231
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,000
you're in a technology business

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,519

233
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,000
real estate or construction

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
all right okay and so

235
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
what did i miss education

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
okay we got education what else

237
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
i'm just trying to get a sense you know

238
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
a perspective so i can i can help

239
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
steer this discussion a little bit um

240
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
and so background are we mostly

241
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
information technology

242
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,120
security

243
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
information technology

244
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
okay

245
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
information security

246
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
okay all right we found

247
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,399
that makes sense because we're at a

248
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,640
security conference so but i've already

249
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
admitted that i'm not information

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
security but you know this is a business

251
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
presentation um so uh

252
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
it's not going to be as technical i

253
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,480
think but um

254
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,000
any anybody

255
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,399
in a risk management function

256
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
we do have some risk management three

257
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,720
okay

258
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
so

259
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,560
does anybody

260
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,640
is anybody currently under the

261
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,839
requirements of cmmc

262
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,480
so

263
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,279
i know you too

264
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
all right

265
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,120
okay so

266
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
before this presentation who has heard

267
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
of cmmc

268
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
all right all right so okay thank you

269
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
for enduring that um i just

270
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,839
and then a predecessor of cmmc was nist

271
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,480
800-171 so if i said that

272
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
how many hands go up

273
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
all right cool

274
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
and again thank you for enduring that it

275
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,440
just helps me um so as i'm going into

276
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
the details you know where i can move a

277
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
little faster and such um so background

278
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,920
the cmmc is stands for the cyber

279
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
maturity model certification

280
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,959
and so it's this is right out of i think

281
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,959
wiki a training certification third

282
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,640
party assessment program of cyber

283
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
security in the united states government

284
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,040
and

285
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
defense space aimed at measuring

286
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
maturity of an organization's cyber

287
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
security processes toward demonstrating

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
compliance with protection of federal

289
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,680
contract information and controlled

290
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,920
unclassified information i've heard some

291
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,399
people call it cui i call it cui i don't

292
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,839
know but

293
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,360
anyway those are the two

294
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,959
big elements that

295
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,279
you've been entrusted as an organization

296
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,800
with information from the federal

297
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
government could be contract information

298
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
it could be that confidential

299
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
unclassified information and so the

300
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,519
standard is is really built around what

301
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,480
are the things that you're doing to

302
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
protect it and i think the the parallel

303
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
that i would draw

304
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,399
to any organization you know what is

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
your cui

306
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,320
every organization has information that

307
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
it that it needs to protect not all

308
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,200
information is equal right there's some

309
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
information that you don't care if it

310
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
gets out in the public and in fact

311
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
there's public classified information

312
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
there's press releases and things like

313
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,640
that

314
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,519
but what is the information that that is

315
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,760
valuable to others that are outside of

316
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,200
your organization

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,000
and

318
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
and how what are you doing to help

319
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,519
safeguard it

320
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
so a little bit of background i guess

321
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
now right now i got an email

322
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
um yes again i'm i'm not a cmmc

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,920
practitioner

324
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,440
i i help

325
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
companies

326
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
to

327
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,279
implement

328
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,360
technical solutions

329
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,079
that

330
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,639
will help them better comply

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
with the cmc standard that's that's

332
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,120
where my role is

333
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
and a lot of that also means that well

334
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,399
gee i have to read it i have to

335
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,079
understand it

336
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
and so i've done that and

337
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,399
and there's there's a couple of

338
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,240
different ways you can meet the elements

339
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,519
of the center you can implement

340
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,120
technical controls

341
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,600
which um which are fixed pretty much

342
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
right you you've locked something down

343
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
so that it can't be done you know you

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,320
can't um deviate from a particular

345
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,720
control or there are procedural controls

346
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
and procedural controls are manual and

347
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
they tend to break down and so companies

348
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
a lot of times want to go after the

349
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,240
those technical controls and um and we

350
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,760
achieve those through the use of

351
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,720
information technology

352
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,600
in this

353
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
cmc

354
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,959
timeline here

355
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,800
the point all i want to make here is

356
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,680
it's fairly new

357
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,399
and the standard itself is evolving

358
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
there's a version 2.0

359
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,279
but the version 1.0 is what i'm going to

360
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,560
talk about

361
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,880
that's the latest information

362
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
at least at the time i was repairing the

363
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
presentation but

364
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
it is um broadening and so the the

365
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
defense department is pushing it uh

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
deeper through the supply base um you

367
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,120
know and and i i've read

368
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
where hey maybe uh this could be a good

369
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,959
reference model for other

370
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,480
entities that are doing business with

371
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
the federal government so it's starting

372
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,079
in the defense supply chain

373
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,959
maybe it has implications more broadly

374
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
so i would keep an eye on that but

375
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,560
in essence you know this timeline is is

376
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,920
giving companies time to to

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
begin

378
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
their compliance journeys

379
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,240
and to push it deeper into their supply

380
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,639
bases

381
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,440
so um

382
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
the the standard is made up of

383
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,000
essentially you've got the model right

384
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,720
and um then you have domains and so

385
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,199
there are 17 domains

386
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
in cmmc

387
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,560
and then

388
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
connected to the domains you've got

389
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,639
processes and so you've got a set of

390
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,360
processes there are five of them

391
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
that cut across all domains

392
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,560
and then as you come down the the ladder

393
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,120
here you get to capabilities

394
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,199
so there are

395
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,360
there are 43 capabilities that are

396
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
broken up across the 17 domains

397
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,720
um and i'll give you a flavor for i'm

398
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,160
not gonna you know this isn't a

399
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
presentation on all uh 17 by 43 by you

400
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,279
know

401
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,920
i'll choose samples right so you get a

402
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,839
flavor for what i'm talking about that's

403
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,360
all i need to do in order to make my

404
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,880
point but um so you've got capabilities

405
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,959
and then nestled up under capabilities

406
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,360
are practices and so it's actually at

407
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,760
the practice level that um that the

408
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,279
assessment happens

409
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,120
and and there are some good documents

410
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,320
that are out on the internet um nist

411
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
publishes a document on cmmc

412
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,279
that

413
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,360
goes through all the detail and provides

414
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,800
all the control points so there's 706

415
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
control points in total

416
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,760
when you look at this and so

417
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,519
that's what an auditor is going to come

418
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,759
in and evaluate and say are you doing

419
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,959
this show me um and so it's it's down at

420
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,959
that practice level that that's that's

421
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,279
where the rubber hits the road

422
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,600
so that's that's the structure

423
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
and

424
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,839
this

425
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,199
and i'm not going to go through all of

426
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,600
these but these are the 17 domains on

427
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
things like access control

428
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,519
how are users

429
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,440
being authenticated and allowed into the

430
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,959
environment

431
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
asset management

432
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
it could be both the information it

433
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,040
could also be the assets that you're

434
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,360
managing to allow access to that

435
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
information awareness and training and

436
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,920
so forth so you get a sense of of the

437
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
different um domains here

438
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
and then on the right hand side you've

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,519
got an idea of the levels right and and

440
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
so on the process side you've got okay

441
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,079
at level one this is what's

442
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,399
performed and then at level two the

443
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
expectation is it's documented what you

444
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
have is documented and then at level

445
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
three it's a little bit more mature it's

446
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
not only document but you're managing to

447
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,920
it

448
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
and then at level four that you've

449
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
started a feedback loop there's a review

450
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,320
process that's happening and you're in

451
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
you know some form of continuous

452
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,519
improvement

453
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,920
and then you know in level five is

454
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,160
optimizing and if anyone's familiar with

455
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,120
maturity models this is a very common

456
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,440
you know framework of uh i say crawl

457
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,639
walk run right and so you're running

458
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
then when you're up at that that top

459
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,439
tier and and you've built the the system

460
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,599
of continuous improvement and that's if

461
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,280
you that's the other way reason i'm

462
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,199
really excited about the cmmc i mean

463
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,559
it's

464
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,520
really you know it's a standard man but

465
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,199
um you know the idea that um

466
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,439
it's a journey right you're never done

467
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
and that's what i believe about security

468
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,559
that's what kind of probably drew me and

469
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
gave me a lot of energy around security

470
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
is it's it's always evolving and you

471
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,679
always have to progress and you always

472
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,280
have to gather feedback and and navigate

473
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
so on the right hand side you've got the

474
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
practices and so

475
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
at the lowest level you know it's basic

476
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
cyber hygiene

477
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,280
you know things like uh you know

478
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,799
computer access do you have screen

479
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,039
savers on on your computers and it's

480
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,640
really basic

481
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,200
you know that time out so that

482
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,120
you know a computer workstation is not

483
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,880
left wide open

484
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,039
do users have unique

485
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,880
login ids right

486
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,520
are they shared ids and

487
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,120
then you get into

488
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,039
intermediate cyber hygiene

489
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,000
good cyber hygiene where maybe at level

490
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
four you're being a little bit more

491
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,799
proactive

492
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,320
and then at five you're advanced and

493
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
progressive so what does that mean

494
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,960
proactive may mean that you know hey

495
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,760
we're

496
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,400
we're seeing things happening and we're

497
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,280
anticipating right um

498
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,240
and and we're taking steps around things

499
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
before you know we really need to

500
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
um and then the advanced progressive

501
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,640
you're looking down the road right you

502
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
maybe you're you're looking at threats

503
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
that are on the horizon you're bringing

504
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,559
those back into your environment

505
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,880
and you really

506
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,559
you understand the assets that are in

507
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,600
your environment and the use context

508
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
and how those threats may

509
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
play on the different assets in your

510
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,600
environment so

511
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,039
again just it gives you a an idea about

512
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,320
progression

513
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
in maturity

514
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
this um

515
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
i think i've got pretty well covered

516
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
this right where um

517
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
you know it's um level one it's

518
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
performed it's documented managed

519
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,160
reviewed and optimized uh but along the

520
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
bottom you know it's it's

521
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
this is the important part of that of

522
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,880
this slide is your basic safeguarding of

523
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,200
fci federal contract information and

524
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
when the government

525
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
issues contracts with you they want to

526
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
know

527
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
is the information that i'm giving you

528
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
how are you protecting it and how are

529
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,919
you keeping it safe

530
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:34,960
now

531
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,799
a federal contract isn't going to have

532
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,720
the same kind of information as you know

533
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
drawings of

534
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,679
might be a

535
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,440
navy vessel um you know where um

536
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,160
you've got layouts uh

537
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,440
that

538
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,520
maybe there's nothing that's that's

539
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
a top secret clearance but it's still

540
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
it's not information that we want to

541
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,960
fall into the hands of our enemies

542
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
and then

543
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,799
you

544
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,720
in level two you're you're you're

545
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
beginning to focus then on the cui

546
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,880
and then increasing levels of protection

547
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,159
over the cui until finally you're

548
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
looking at reducing the risk of apts

549
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,240
advanced persistent threats

550
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,120
so flip one oops wrong way

551
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,400
this um will give you a little bit of

552
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,120
understanding to okay when i talk about

553
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,880
the five processes

554
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
what are they and so

555
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
there are no processes

556
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
at level one but when you move to level

557
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,039
two they're looking for documentation so

558
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
each practice is documented including

559
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,000
your your level one practices and then

560
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,400
also a policy exists that includes all

561
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
activities

562
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,880
and and so this moves across all 17

563
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
domains so

564
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,559
at level 2 you're beginning

565
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,440
the documentation of your system and i

566
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,600
i'm just a quick aside i may work with a

567
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
number of companies in the small to

568
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
medium business space

569
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,159
and

570
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,679
documentation yeah how many people uh

571
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
because when you're trying to run your

572
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
business and you're running on a slim

573
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,919
margin um there is so often times that

574
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,960
documentation just doesn't exist and so

575
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,080
getting this process started um

576
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
hopefully that's not the case for bigger

577
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,760
companies but um anyway just just

578
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,480
getting documentation started and and

579
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,400
some entrepreneurs would say why do i

580
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
need documentation because it's about

581
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,200
you know saying what it is you're going

582
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,080
to do

583
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,919
and then letting everybody know and then

584
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,440
managing yourself and holding yourself

585
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,960
accountable to it

586
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,360
as you move to level three you obviously

587
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,960
you've got the first two but then it

588
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,640
adds a plan a plan exists is maintained

589
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,440
and

590
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
resourced that includes all activities

591
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,880
all activities being the all domains

592
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,440
so you're actually planning you're

593
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
you're

594
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,400
you've got an idea of the things that

595
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,280
you need to implement so maybe costs

596
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,320
resourcing schedules right

597
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,400
in terms of implementation

598
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
that's that's what's meant by by

599
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,520
planning then

600
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
as you move into level four you add to

601
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,360
the bottom activities are reviewed and

602
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
measured for effectiveness and the

603
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
results of the review is shared with

604
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
higher level management that's like

605
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,159
right out of iso 9000 that it was a

606
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,080
quality management review

607
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
that you provide

608
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
feedback to management because at the

609
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,159
end of the day they're accountable well

610
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,000
same thing with information security and

611
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,799
any executive who doesn't say i own

612
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,960
information security let me talk to them

613
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
because you know you're the verse you're

614
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,159
responsible for your organization's risk

615
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,440
and the the risk decisions um that your

616
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
organization is making

617
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,640
and so

618
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,919
you need to be a part of the

619
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,600
understanding what is going on and the

620
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
progress that you're making

621
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,360
and so that's then this review process

622
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,799
and then finally

623
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,960
if i look at level five the additional

624
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200
process there is standardized document

625
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,120
approach across all applicable

626
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
organizational units so you've taken

627
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
this system maybe it was a little

628
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,200
enclave at first now you're spreading it

629
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,799
out across the entire organization so

630
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
you can see my point i mean in terms of

631
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
progression right uh

632
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
one of the reasons i've got a lot of

633
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
energy around this

634
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
all right and so then if we move to

635
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,280
practices

636
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,320
um you get a sense that okay there there

637
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
wasn't one

638
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
standard that was used that had all of

639
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,360
this

640
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,360
the the

641
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,000
capabilities that were needed

642
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
by this organization there was a group

643
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,039
that

644
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,600
drafted this and that got this put into

645
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,880
place

646
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,919
and so

647
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,799
essentially in my eyes from here but but

648
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,000
far

649
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
there's some

650
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,600
policies government policies that define

651
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,120
the control of federal contract

652
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,880
information and that's what's in level

653
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
one and then as you get into level two

654
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,919
or you're looking at uh intermediate

655
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,080
cyber hygiene then

656
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,559
you're compliant with all the far

657
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,679
requirements but then you add a portion

658
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,720
of mist 800 171

659
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,840
and then

660
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,080
it also includes an additional seven

661
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
practices to support intermediate cyber

662
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,120
hygiene so

663
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,279
that is one of those okay it's outside

664
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,200
of a

665
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,240
of this standard right but um the group

666
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
looked across to different international

667
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,360
standards and requirements of other i

668
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
guess nato or uh you know

669
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,760
friendly governments and and kind of

670
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,559
looked for the the cyber best practices

671
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
and this they did they crafted this as

672
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,679
you move into level three it encompasses

673
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,279
all practices of the nist 800

674
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,760
and includes an additional 20 practices

675
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,320
that support good cyber hygiene so again

676
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,039
you know you're you're moving to levels

677
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,400
of of higher um higher control and then

678
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,480
there is um some revisions that are

679
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,520
happening to nist 800 171 and that's

680
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
what you're looking at in in four and

681
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,320
five so

682
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,919
the

683
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,000
primary thing i was trying to get across

684
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,679
here and i

685
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,400
think

686
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,919
is the a screens i'm trying to

687
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,360
understand why i'm spending so much time

688
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,200
on this side i guess i can come over

689
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
here um

690
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
the uh the primary thing i was trying to

691
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,919
get across from here is that um if you

692
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,919
look at the color coding you know you've

693
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
got a kind of a white that's a level one

694
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
you've got maybe a gray or a light

695
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
purple that's level two right and then

696
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,279
the the shades of purple then um

697
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,400
show the

698
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,039
level three level four level five and

699
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,039
that um you know

700
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,880
pretty well they're they're they're

701
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,840
mixed across all 17 domains right

702
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,120
there's there's one that um

703
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,159
uh

704
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,200
see look at situational awareness right

705
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,520
it doesn't it's not anything in level

706
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,279
one or two it's pretty much starts at

707
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,720
level three

708
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,360
but um most everything else there it's

709
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,159
spread across the different

710
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,760
different levels

711
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,240
so if you're again i'm going to make

712
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,520
this point again

713
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,679
you know if you're just getting out

714
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,600
then and you're looking for a way to

715
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
move forward you know

716
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
do you jump right into the deep end or

717
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,520
do you kind of you know you dip your toe

718
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
in the water and you start working on

719
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
some easier things and you move forward

720
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
and you move forward

721
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,400
you know and if you

722
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,080
don't have perimeter security and you

723
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
don't have a lot of technology that

724
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,679
would otherwise keep you safe you might

725
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,039
want to think about doing those things

726
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,400
too but

727
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
you know endpoint protection and and

728
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,000
such but um

729
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,279
you know if you're looking at your

730
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,400
system

731
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,760
this is what this is this is a

732
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,720
management system for cyber security

733
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
and what are the things that i need to

734
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
start on now and move forward to

735
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,520
progress to additional levels of

736
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,158
difficulty

737
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
what

738
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
which if you look at these

739
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
any thoughts on what's what's the most

740
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,600
extensive

741
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,679
which which ones i mean

742
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,480
and

743
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
i guess i i can kind of start to answer

744
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,000
the question and additional questions

745
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
but um

746
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,840
when you look at these uh i think of

747
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,600
extensive being hey you know there's a

748
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,440
lot of requirements there

749
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,480
right so

750
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,279
um

751
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,000
you know

752
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,760
there are two areas that jump out you

753
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,320
know access control is one of them right

754
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
and then system and communication

755
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
protection

756
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,799
you've got 26 and 27

757
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,960
total requirements under under each of

758
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,480
those right and and a good blend of you

759
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
know all the different levels

760
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,360
now that little green arrow is i tried

761
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
to pick one of the easier ones you have

762
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,640
to dive deep

763
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,840
so media protection to me was was

764
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,480
there's only eight total requirements so

765
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,559
going into the details so this is an

766
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,399
example of what you would see

767
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,679
then if you

768
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,840
then were to dive into the details now

769
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,520
first of all

770
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,799
it kind of took me a little while to

771
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,159
figure this out

772
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:20,880
so

773
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,679
you know

774
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,279
time for confession here for a second

775
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,039
but when you look at the numbering

776
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,399
that little so

777
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,279
mp media protection right so those if we

778
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
went back to that pyramid chart every

779
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
one of those domains had a two letter

780
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,120
acronym and so mp media protection so

781
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,559
that's not the part that took me a while

782
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,480
to figure out but the part that took me

783
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,399
a while to figure out was that the

784
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,880
number right after the dot one well

785
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,279
that's level one right and it seems

786
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,760
pretty elementary but um i guess it was

787
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
lost on me for a little while um and so

788
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
you know with level one here

789
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,039
you've got

790
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,520
sanitizer destroy information system

791
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,360
media containing federal contract

792
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,840
information before disposal or release

793
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,039
for reuse

794
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,120
that's basic

795
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
then you move to two

796
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
that you've got to protect

797
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,279
system media containing cui both paper

798
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,200
and digital

799
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,240
limit access to cui on system media to

800
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,840
authorize users

801
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,720
control the use of removable media on

802
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,679
system components so that's level two

803
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,000
right so how many companies have locked

804
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,720
down so you can't put usbs into those

805
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,919
usb ports the the memory sticks right

806
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,720
it's

807
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,399
that's level two

808
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,480
or or if you allow it what are the

809
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
controls around it right maybe there's a

810
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,559
um

811
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,480
an encryption requirement

812
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,080
and that um

813
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,000
that usb will only work in a

814
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,640
company computer for example or if it's

815
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,559
used outside it needs some kind of a

816
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,399
login and password

817
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,080
that's the way we would protect the

818
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,840
mobile media and and of course it's

819
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,760
encrypted

820
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
then the

821
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,240
so

822
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,760
see the the 998 999 those are the

823
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
process that took me a while to figure

824
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,039
out too

825
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,039
it's like i i should have i should have

826
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,520
started with all the documentation that

827
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,840
i that i i'm sharing here

828
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,679
um you know i was i jumped right into

829
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,760
the details and then kind of brought

830
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
myself back up it's like hold on is

831
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,919
there any kind of an overview document

832
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,080
that would help as a roadmap so that

833
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,919
would be a recommendation uh for

834
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,440
everybody

835
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,559
and um

836
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
and so 998 document the cmmc practices

837
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,480
to implement media protection policy and

838
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,279
then a 999 establish a policy that

839
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,200
includes media protection

840
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,080
right

841
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
and now we move into

842
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,320
level three level three would be you

843
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,520
mark media with necessary cui markings

844
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,919
and distribution limitations

845
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,519
so what does that mean if you're a

846
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,840
company that's been entrusted with cui

847
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,200
then

848
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,960
if you've got some kind of a document

849
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,039
labeling classification capability

850
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,880
electronically you're classifying

851
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
documents so that you can control it

852
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,200
using dlp tools

853
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
or if you're

854
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,440
able to make prints or somehow check out

855
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,000
media that you maintain logs right who

856
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,480
took it and then that you record it back

857
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
in that's that's the control

858
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,600
um

859
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,360
and then the next prohibit the use of

860
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,200
portable storage devices when such

861
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,399
devices have no identifiable owner seems

862
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,320
pretty basic

863
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,360
124 control access to media containing

864
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,840
cui and maintain accountability for

865
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,559
media during transport outside of

866
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,880
controlled areas again that that could

867
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,360
be electronic that could be you know hey

868
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,720
i had to make a paper print out and you

869
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
know what are the controls that you you

870
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,360
put around the protection of that

871
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,799
then

872
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,960
implement cryptographic mechanisms this

873
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,320
is still level three to protect the

874
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,840
confidential out

875
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,720
of cui stored or on digital media during

876
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,799
transport unless otherwise protected by

877
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,000
alternative physical safeguards so

878
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,240
encryption right

879
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,120
and then

880
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,640
997 996 995 now we're back to the

881
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
process uh requirements and so the

882
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
process requirements and so for media

883
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
protection there is no level four

884
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,679
um uh

885
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,720
practice area a practice requirement

886
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,240
there is no level five practice

887
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,120
requirement but there is level four and

888
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,919
five process requirements then which if

889
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,919
you are trying to

890
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,039
certify

891
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,720
if your company you're trying to certify

892
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,440
to level three well you can put put

893
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
aside all the level four and five

894
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,840
requirements because they're outside of

895
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,640
what's going to be audited right

896
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,399
and so

897
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,399
but i'm sharing them because you know

898
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,200
we're talking about the maturity model

899
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,399
and so

900
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,039
level four then is to review and measure

901
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,480
media protection activities for

902
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
effectiveness and to standardize and

903
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,640
optimize a documented approach for media

904
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,559
protection across all political

905
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,000
organization

906
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,880
units

907
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,519
so anyway does that does that makes

908
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,360
sense then in terms of the structure

909
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,279
right um and so um so it's not uncommon

910
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,559
and this is what's good about the

911
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,840
maturity model is that um the the type

912
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,000
of business that you're doing uh will

913
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
will define

914
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,600
the level of that you need to comply

915
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,799
with

916
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,120
for some uh we're just handling federal

917
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
contract information right i need to be

918
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,760
a level one or a level two and it's

919
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,200
supposed to be the government's going to

920
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
tell you you know in the contracts you

921
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
know you need to be compliant with level

922
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,480
one or level three and you know the the

923
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,679
stick is that at some point no orders

924
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,559
will be placed on companies that are not

925
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,799
compliant with those levels right so

926
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,039
that's in incentive

927
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,799
for companies to go out and and to

928
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,039
comply but um

929
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,880
and generally i think the biggest

930
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,559
majority of companies in the defense

931
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,880
supply chain are going to be around a

932
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,000
level three

933
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
and that's why i use that as an example

934
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
if you're level three then four and five

935
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,480
really don't apply i mean you can go and

936
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,719
do them because they're good things to

937
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,639
be working on but you're not going to be

938
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,480
held accountable for it

939
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,839
yeah

940
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,879
oh go ahead yes

941
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,079
um

942
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,960
so

943
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,040
if you go back to that one chart that

944
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,440
said level four or five that's where

945
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,879
we're starting to put practice and

946
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,199
discipline in place around apts

947
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,000
right and so um inasmuch as that's into

948
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,199
the weeds yeah but um no

949
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,359
i chose this one because it was short

950
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,280
and i could get through it in in a short

951
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
amount of time but if i went back um you

952
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,520
know to this page

953
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,560
that um

954
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,280
you can see where you know you do have

955
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,119
like incident response

956
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,560
um you know heavily four and five

957
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,000
um or in system communication

958
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
anyway just there are some that have

959
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,920
higher level requirements because

960
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,440
there's more advanced things that you

961
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,720
can be doing

962
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,959
in them

963
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,599
okay

964
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,560
all right i think we got that

965
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,800
all right

966
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,000
so i guess i i kind of wanted to just

967
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
shout out you know what is there

968
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
anything where is your organization on

969
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,000
its cyber uh

970
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,520
maturity

971
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,720
cyber security journey i guess um

972
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,440
there's we

973
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,960
for some organizations they've been at

974
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,800
it a while um

975
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
maybe you know you you've got good

976
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,839
systems and structures um for others

977
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,320
maybe you're you're more in the beginner

978
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,119
mode

979
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,720
in the small and medium

980
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,000
market space which i play a lot in

981
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,359
you know we find companies that

982
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,680
i'd say kind of level one you know

983
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,160
they've got some basic hygiene but but

984
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,960
need need help and especially um you

985
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,040
know when we start thinking about

986
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,680
their intellectual property or

987
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
information that um you know that

988
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,079
they're they're trying to protect right

989
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,680
and the controls that they have around

990
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,880
that

991
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,560
and that's where we spend a lot of our

992
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
time

993
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,440
then i guess um does your organization

994
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,320
use a cyber maturity model and and

995
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,200
um

996
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,240
you know if you

997
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,079
that's kind of a loaded question because

998
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,680
i'm not does anybody else aware of a

999
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,599
cyber maturity model

1000
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,640
that

1001
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,160
goes we have standards right the

1002
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
standards basically say

1003
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,520
here's what you need to do

1004
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,000
but it doesn't lay it out in a way that

1005
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,160
helps organizations move in a you know

1006
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,920
bite-sized approach

1007
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,680
again that's that was really the point i

1008
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,520
wanted to make here

1009
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,760
but um

1010
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,079
if anybody knows a one i'm i'm i'm game

1011
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,400
you know it's like which one i'll go out

1012
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,560
and

1013
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,319
software assurance okay great

1014
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,079
gotcha no i think um

1015
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,240
so definitely uh

1016
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,359
sitting through the presentations

1017
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,359
yesterday i

1018
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,280
you know i don't spend a lot of time in

1019
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,839
in the coding space now i do some um

1020
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,920
due diligence and companies and we we

1021
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
kind of scratch the surface where we're

1022
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,800
working uh due diligence on software

1023
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,520
kinds of companies uh we'll look at um

1024
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,359
you know the the basic practices

1025
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,400
controls um and such but um you know in

1026
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,640
terms of of a maturity model around

1027
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,800
software then then that sounds like yeah

1028
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,839
it's it's that's very important no no

1029
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,320
question um you know this system is

1030
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,960
intended the entire security

1031
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,079
management

1032
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,760
system right so um yeah i know i i

1033
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,880
like i said

1034
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,599
you know i don't i don't pretend to

1035
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,599
know everything

1036
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,200
i definitely say you know i'm always

1037
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,960
learning and

1038
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
so there may be things that that i

1039
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,040
haven't come across

1040
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,359
and again what made this unique to me

1041
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,160
was

1042
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,960
that that model that helped with um

1043
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,160
advancement

1044
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,040
um so

1045
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,839
set aside kind of the defense department

1046
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,720
um requirements but you know

1047
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,960
what do you see the relevance of a model

1048
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
like this um you know is is this make a

1049
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
useful roadmap

1050
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,079
um you know as you think about what to

1051
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,400
go back and and to take on

1052
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,520
right and so it paints all of the areas

1053
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,160
that are underneath that cyber umbrella

1054
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,000
and it also

1055
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,280
again it just it lays out a pathway and

1056
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,079
i think

1057
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,680
i would say

1058
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,680
you know the system is kind of the

1059
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,359
documented side

1060
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,320
um you know if you've got gaps in in

1061
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,800
basic cyber capabilities you know i'd

1062
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,640
emphasize

1063
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,720
i've been there right i was i was in a

1064
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,880
company that um

1065
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,000
you know

1066
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,880
we had

1067
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,440
some level of documentation and there

1068
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
was a lot of focus being put on the

1069
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
documentation and i said wait a second

1070
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,839
it's like my front door's open

1071
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,640
it wasn't really i'm exaggerating but um

1072
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,520
you know that we've got technical gaps

1073
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,280
that that need to be filled and so you

1074
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,640
want me to take care of that or do you

1075
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
want me documented policies

1076
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,800
and in some cases the policies are going

1077
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
to be important right but for the most

1078
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,440
part i'd rather make sure that my

1079
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,400
security services my firewalls my

1080
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,440
endpoint protection um you know and such

1081
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,440
is is locked down um and and secure um

1082
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,760
and i'll be working policy documentation

1083
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
right alongside or right after that but

1084
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,640
um anyway that's um

1085
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,599
the

1086
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,720
i and and just anybody who wants to to

1087
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,480
shout out it's like

1088
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,480
yes

1089
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,720
is that okay i'm going to show my

1090
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,880
ignorance is is it nist 800

1091
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,040
okay 53 right it's the controls right

1092
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,440
right and so 53 there are elements of 53

1093
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,079
that are rolled up under um cmmz

1094
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,079
um

1095
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,280
not that i'm aware of i mean so as you

1096
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,359
can see cmmc was was kind of pieced

1097
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,079
together from multiple standards right

1098
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,599
and then they they put that maturity

1099
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,720
model together in question

1100
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
right

1101
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,319
so that that's the that's the

1102
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,400
million-dollar question right there um

1103
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,280
is

1104
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,000
so let's say i'm a defense contractor

1105
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,240
and i'm i'm outsourcing

1106
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,680
elements of

1107
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,040
my compliance meaning maybe i bring in

1108
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,680
an msp to manage my help desk i've got

1109
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,200
an mssp

1110
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,520
um and that mssp

1111
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,800
may have um outside relationships maybe

1112
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,599
they've got a sim that's in the cloud

1113
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,839
they've got an endpoint protection

1114
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,160
that um

1115
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,480
is uh in the cloud as well um and so

1116
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,359
are are those products that they have to

1117
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,319
be cmmc certified and i think the purist

1118
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,200
would say yes absolutely but it's not

1119
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,480
gonna

1120
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,119
that is the big debate right now and and

1121
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,760
so right now the focus is on that

1122
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,000
defense contractor

1123
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,839
and at some point it may

1124
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,359
you know

1125
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,280
broaden into

1126
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,119
the services that they're receiving so

1127
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,880
if you are an msp or an mssp that are

1128
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,240
providing

1129
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,440
services to defense related companies

1130
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,280
you want to look at you know your supply

1131
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,160
chain

1132
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,599
and you want to look at what they're

1133
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
doing to comply with the the elements of

1134
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,400
the standard um you know i've done a lot

1135
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
a fair amount of work research around

1136
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,599
here and i'm not plugging you know one

1137
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,240
company or the other um you know aws has

1138
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,960
a gov cloud uh microsoft has the

1139
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
govcloud and in microsoft there's

1140
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
different levels and you've got the

1141
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,319
gcc gcc high and then dod

1142
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,520
and the gcc high is you know for level

1143
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,560
three

1144
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,000
uh maybe four right dod is the top

1145
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,640
secret type of requirements and

1146
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,520
the environments get more locked down

1147
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,280
and the more you can build on that kind

1148
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,960
of infrastructure

1149
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,839
you know the less

1150
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,640
control audit you have on premise

1151
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,240
and so

1152
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,160
where i'm going with that is what i've

1153
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,800
seen companies do is they build the full

1154
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,760
security environment on on that

1155
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,119
environment that stack gcc high so e5

1156
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,200
with microsoft then this is going to be

1157
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,599
their mechanism to comply with the

1158
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,720
government requirements and again

1159
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
they're not trying to make this a plug

1160
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,440
of any product or service um you know

1161
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,200
i'm just sharing what i've what i've

1162
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,079
read and what i've learned here so

1163
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,599
good question that's and if i had the

1164
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,200
answer to it i'd you know

1165
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,000
be a crystal ball frankly

1166
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
yes

1167
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,919
there you go

1168
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,560
yeah and so um the things i learned

1169
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
doing research was if you're on

1170
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,800
operating on office 365 commercial for

1171
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,040
example um that doesn't comply and

1172
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,200
there's a couple of things and one is

1173
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,560
the um

1174
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,520
the the

1175
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,839
audit the forensics right the the

1176
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,839
ability to to comply with some of the

1177
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,160
forensic requirements isn't robust

1178
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,359
enough there

1179
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,280
whereas in the gov

1180
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,079
and gcc high office 365 environments

1181
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,040
they are um and and so

1182
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
you you really have to understand and i

1183
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,319
think that's the point of the question

1184
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,040
or the statement really it was a hey aws

1185
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,280
has the gov cloud

1186
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,440
and you know there are certain things

1187
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,280
that get you part of the way there but

1188
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,839
the onus is really still on you

1189
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,079
to make sure that you're you're able to

1190
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,119
comply

1191
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,280
um and and so

1192
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
it's important to understand what is the

1193
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,359
government looking for in a data center

1194
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,680
right um and and

1195
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,400
or cloud software right

1196
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,280
and so that answer is they're looking

1197
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,640
for the ability to to do forensics right

1198
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,880
so if you can't do forensics then that's

1199
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,640
a big red flag

1200
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,520
and then the other is that

1201
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,119
they're looking for where's the data

1202
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,079
center located the data is it resident

1203
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,160
in the u.s all the time who are the

1204
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,560
hands that are touching that data center

1205
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,359
right so are they us citizens

1206
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,359
um and so

1207
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,000
all of that comes into play in terms of

1208
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,640
you know determining the level uh that

1209
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,240
the data center operates on and i guess

1210
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,560
the point with all of that is

1211
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,280
in any cloud system any vendor that

1212
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,760
you're procuring services and support

1213
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,960
for and you're

1214
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,280
under a requirement for cmmc

1215
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
level three then at some point

1216
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,400
you know conceivably you have to do your

1217
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,240
due diligence across your supply base

1218
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,480
right

1219
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,079
any other questions let me wrap it up

1220
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,079
yes

1221
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,680
what i've uh three years so you it's um

1222
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,560
kind of

1223
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,240
you're you're reassessed every three

1224
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,079
years and and your obligation um

1225
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,480
typically the result of a cmmc

1226
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,440
assessment is something called the poem

1227
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,160
poem sometimes it's all run together and

1228
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
that's that's your action plan

1229
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,480
and so your assessor lays out here are

1230
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,119
the gaps and you as the organization are

1231
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,720
identifying okay here's what we're going

1232
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,359
to do with that and here's the time

1233
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,720
we're going to have those issues

1234
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,640
resolved that's the initial you know

1235
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,240
certification

1236
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,400
and then it's reassessed every three

1237
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,560
years is my my understanding right now

1238
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,079
but but none of this is you know it's

1239
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,800
good it kind of got pushed out because

1240
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,760
of you know our covet environment yes

1241
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,760
questions

1242
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,559
um

1243
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,119
right

1244
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,760
right right

1245
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,880
yeah

1246
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,640
that's that's like the million dollar

1247
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
question for sure um

1248
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,760
so when i advise companies on strategy

1249
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,880
i'm i'm

1250
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,680
i'm looking to create a simple

1251
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,280
environment um

1252
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,960
i i'm a big believer in in i.t debt

1253
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,599
you know not expanding i.t debt and i.t

1254
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,680
debt comes from a lot of different

1255
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,440
factors one is how many different

1256
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,760
solutions am i trying to manage in my

1257
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,640
environment right and keeping that a

1258
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,880
smaller number rather than bigger number

1259
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,119
um itd is uh

1260
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,720
the development work how many different

1261
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,559
applications how many different i mean

1262
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,000
it's just

1263
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,760
it's it's the

1264
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,280
it's the hidden uh cost in some ways

1265
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,119
the organization may not necessarily see

1266
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,960
it but it it takes takes

1267
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,040
resources and spreads them out and

1268
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,960
spreads them thin and what i try to do

1269
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,640
is you know help to to create that focus

1270
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,559
where there's fewer tools or you can

1271
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,880
become experts on a platform you know

1272
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,680
i'm a big believer in and that kind of

1273
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,960
decision making

1274
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,040
but in terms of what do i look for i

1275
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,839
mean

1276
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,359
it's different right it's gonna be

1277
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,200
different by by organization in terms of

1278
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,119
what are they what's their current

1279
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,440
footprint um where are they now and

1280
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,680
where do we need to move them

1281
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
um and and so

1282
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,040
there is no prescription a set

1283
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,839
prescription from my perspective

1284
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,960
yeah just what helps simplify you i'm

1285
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,079
huge

1286
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,280
anything else

1287
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,880
is there anything i didn't cover up here

1288
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,440
yeah so i think i'm not going to go back

1289
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,359
over my main points because i

1290
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,680
emphasize them throughout the entire

1291
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,599
conversation but

1292
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,599
i do have time if there's any other

1293
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,359
questions

1294
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,960
all right well i thank you everybody

1295
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,440
appreciate the engagement
