1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,120
so

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,279
so my name is uh carl jankowski and this

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,600
is network assessments cyber security

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,519
quackery and fraud

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,960
and let me just start off by saying i'm

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
absolutely humbled to be in front of all

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,400
of you guys did i just see a blink i

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,519
think it's up like

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,640
i'm absolutely humble to be in front of

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,479
all of you guys i've met some of you at

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,440
rva at the thursday nights and i'm just

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
i'm wowed by the amount of

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
perspective and insight that you all

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,879
bring so just thank you for giving me

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,719
this opportunity to talk to you

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
and thank you to chris and jake and the

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,840
whole

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
team because you guys are awesome

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,319
so

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
in the interest of really just keeping

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,199
everyone's time

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,600
respected this is primarily focused on

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,440
small business

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
owners executives and those who work in

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,239
i.t

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
my perspective though is from a managed

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,799
service provider standpoint so it's it's

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
also maybe for msps it's a little angled

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
and primarily for information technology

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920
governance enthusiasts is there anyone

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,880
here that identifies themselves as such

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
all right we got two right on okay three

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
awesome so i i consider myself an

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,439
information technology governance

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,479
enthusiast i got here by ways of uh 21

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,960
years working software development

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,759
i

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
began my career sort of as a lowly help

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,360
desk technician and worked through

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,799
system administration and engineering

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,240
and so on so forth

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,479
and i got to some of the more important

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,640
strategic parts of business and

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
i found that

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
governance linked some of the things i

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,920
learned early on the basics the

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,280
fundamentals

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
with doing the right thing

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,839
i also

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,560
i'm trying to think where i want to go

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
with this for a second oh yeah so so the

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,680
other thing is um

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
governance for me uh has led me to a

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,719
path where i was able to develop and

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
build a successful stock 2 program in a

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,000
relatively short period of time and

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
that's probably one of my bigger

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
achievements for the past year very

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
proud of it i think that's a that's

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,599
something that

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
brought value to where i'm at and

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
obviously kind of formed the basis of

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,280
this talk

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,200
the journey here we're going to be on is

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
going to be uh it's really two acts it

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
looks like three but it's really two

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,480
there's a setup and the setup is

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,720
essentially me talking about an email

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
that kind of got me thinking into this

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
rabbit hole and then the performance the

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
performance is sort of how

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
we can go on and do something

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
do something that's better than what the

74
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,640
setup brings forth so that's sort of the

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,359
approach we're going to take here

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,519
so for some context

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,040
as i shed some pages

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
pages and pages of notes uh some context

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
uh what i want to first of all say is

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
what are network assessments and they

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
that's a uni sort of a unicorn term i

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,400
think it's very much like saying cloud

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
it doesn't really mean much um what are

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
the useful and

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
when are they useful and how are they

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
applied so a little bit of backstory a

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
little bit of history here

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
number one

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
i think technology assessment started in

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,480
1960s when technology became a thing and

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,680
they were really

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
done

93
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
they were designed to figure out how

94
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,239
technology could be misused and sort of

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
when it didn't work right what could you

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
do

97
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,799
the rest of it really didn't matter to

98
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,720
me because i wasn't there for it but we

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,319
eventually reached the point where the

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
microsoft security baseline baseline

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
security analyzer made its first

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,879
appearance and that was sort of a

103
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,720
pivotal moment for me personally along

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
my path it was in 2004 and at that point

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
in time there was a shift i think from a

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,879
situation where

107
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,400
systems were open if you

108
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
deployed a windows server for example it

109
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,519
had sort of no permission sets and

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,200
everything was available to a least

111
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,720
privileged type of concept so i think

112
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
that was a material point and the

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
baseline security analyzer was sort of

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,439
the first tool that i've personally come

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,480
in contact with that ran against a

116
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
configuration and it told you the things

117
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,159
that were potentially wrong and the

118
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,680
things that you need to do to fix it so

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
it was in context it ran on a system

120
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,959
that you cared about and it did

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,640
something very specific and it gave you

122
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
actionable results

123
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,320
uh then time facebook phones smartphones

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
and all that stuff happened and we

125
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,798
arrived at the beginnings of zta and

126
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,240
what i think was a

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
despite the fact that i do not disagree

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
with all the stuff said about beyondcorp

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
i think the pivotal moment was 2019 um

130
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
when the when this published their zta

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,639
architecture papers i think at that

132
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,240
point in time it just sort of turned a

133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,960
trickle to a fire hose and we

134
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,639
sort of really quickly steamrolled into

135
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,520
the situation we're in today which is uh

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
the push for

137
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
zta compliance and zta

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
implementation across enterprise and

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
small business

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
so i think that's where we are today

141
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
and

142
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
as i said this is really about small

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,199
business right so

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,639
the reason small business excites me is

145
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,080
small businesses are like frustrated

146
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,039
puzzles

147
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,800
uh you you sort of if you were to thrift

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
store pick something up you may not know

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
what it is but you want to put it

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,240
together and they you don't really have

151
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
they don't really have all the resources

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
all of the

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
all of the time all of the knowledge to

154
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
actually do cyber security well but some

155
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
of them try and my favorite example is

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
my long company their job is primarily

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,919
to spray toxic things on my grass

158
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,880
and

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
and they have

160
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
they use a portal now granted the portal

161
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,360
is not theirs the portal is from a

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
vendor they chose but their vendor

163
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,919
displays their sock seal proudly and and

164
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,120
sox feels meaningless that's not the

165
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,880
point the point is that they've built

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
they felt it was so important to show

167
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
that they're doing the right thing

168
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
that they went out and and plastered

169
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
that on every single page that's inside

170
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
their application which is something i

171
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
don't think i ever see anywhere else

172
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
so somewhere someone out there decided

173
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
that this was important and they wanted

174
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,080
to share that not only with the with

175
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
their customer who is in fact the long

176
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
company that does all this but also the

177
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,560
end user which happens to be me

178
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
and

179
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
doing the right thing is going to be a

180
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,599
big premise here

181
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
all right so now the setup

182
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,240
so i think we can all agree that we're

183
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
at a juncture at this point uh where

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
where everyone is trying to do something

185
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
enterprises are scrambling and

186
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,400
and

187
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,919
i would say small companies more so than

188
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,479
anybody else

189
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
small companies but anybody else wants

190
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
to

191
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
wan they want a magic pill small

192
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
companies often aren't really willing or

193
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,199
often aren't

194
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,039
able to just say we're going to do all

195
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
of these things properly what they want

196
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
is they want to go to somebody and say

197
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,919
hey fix our problems

198
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,280
and then take a pill and then know

199
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
everything's okay

200
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
and my argument is that that's not

201
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,639
really possible that you have to do some

202
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,840
of the work you have to do the

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,680
groundwork and whether you are a manager

204
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
who thinks this is not my area it is if

205
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
you're if you're a business owner it's

206
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
definitely your area you have a lot to

207
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,720
lose if you're smoking how many of you

208
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
work for small companies here

209
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
all right okay small small part well

210
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,919
uh how many of you are affected by small

211
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
companies in your day-to-day

212
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,240
okay that list is a little bit bigger so

213
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
uh doing the right thing cyber security

214
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
isn't always often about doing the right

215
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,880
thing for your business it's really

216
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
doing something right for your customers

217
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
or your customers customers right so

218
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
hey

219
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,000
and if you're a small business owner if

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
you make a mistake there is no like file

221
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
for bankruptcy check a box and then

222
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,639
restart you lose everything

223
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,400
so i think they're more likely to fall

224
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,400
for

225
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,160
uh snake oil

226
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
so this is how all this started um i got

227
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,560
a vendor email

228
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
this when i say this all started i mean

229
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,840
this this talk the premise for this talk

230
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
and sort of everything that i wanted to

231
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,360
cover today

232
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,680
um

233
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,919
i received an email from a vendor

234
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,759
who

235
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,720
prayed and sprayed

236
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
an advertising campaign inviting me to a

237
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,560
webinar we some of you may have even

238
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,680
seen this

239
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
and what that email said was msps who

240
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,120
use

241
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,319
said product

242
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
close seven out of ten new business

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
opportunities and i saw it i had to

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,199
archive it i had to touch it that was my

245
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,319
mistake filters were not set up

246
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,440
correctly um so i did and it just stuck

247
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,199
and i have like some serious cases of

248
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,919
adhd so that really stuck and it

249
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,199
bothered me and i kept going back to it

250
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
i kept rereading this message going why

251
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,879
why like oh why is this a thing and

252
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
i thought i could just forget about it

253
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
but i couldn't so i decided to dig

254
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,799
deeper

255
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
and there were really two things about

256
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
that email that bothered me one is the

257
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,679
claim of seven to ten new business

258
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,279
opportunities i really didn't know what

259
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,040
those could be um

260
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
part of me believed that the business

261
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
opportunities were essentially like i go

262
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
to prospect

263
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
and talk to them and now i have a sale

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,240
the other part was like well maybe it's

265
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
not maybe something simpler maybe it's

266
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
uh you know like run a scan and

267
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
open up some tickets and build for that

268
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,279
so i really didn't know what it was i

269
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,959
thought it was kind of dubious

270
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,160
i also was kind of bothered by um

271
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,320
by the fact that it was seven out of ten

272
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,519
right like it was there's a really high

273
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,560
percentage so i thought maybe a little

274
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
bit puffery and like and remind you this

275
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
is just an advertisement email that's in

276
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
an inbox that's like flooded with things

277
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
all the time but this one stuck out so i

278
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
decided i was going to approach it

279
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
methodically and and i was going to

280
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
follow a process to try to understand

281
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
what the claim was and then maybe come

282
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
up with an alternative for it so i set

283
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,040
up for biases and they were biases later

284
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,320
they might have been something else but

285
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
at that point i was really kind of jaded

286
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,680
about the whole thing so i said all

287
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
right well i think there's some

288
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
buffering deception happening there

289
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
so that's the claim

290
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
um

291
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,000
i think it might be a little

292
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,519
self-serving and i really believe in

293
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,959
being fiduciary when you're uh when

294
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,240
you're in it i think that if you're

295
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
providing a service to customers it

296
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
should be a fiduciary responsibility i

297
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,720
think you should always work in the

298
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,760
interest of the client whoever the

299
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,600
client might be so if you're working for

300
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
a company your client is potentially

301
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,399
your employer in some respect um and i

302
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,839
think you should do your issue

303
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,959
i think you should do your job well come

304
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,439
back there we go

305
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
i also kind of postulated that there's

306
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,320
really unlikely to be any material

307
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
benefit uh to the customer's customer in

308
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
this case msb

309
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,279
chain is

310
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,680
the customer's right right below it

311
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
and perhaps you should avoid it

312
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,959
and maybe because there's a claim

313
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,240
somewhere along the way that i

314
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,279
discovered that they were like the

315
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,120
number one tool for this particular

316
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
thing so maybe there's a popularity that

317
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,839
was there rather than usefulness

318
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,360
and i set out to

319
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,839
create a process for myself that would

320
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
allow me to kind of shed these biases

321
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,800
because i figured if i can prove one of

322
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
these wrong i'm done and i can forget

323
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,079
about this and move on with my day and

324
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,600
everything else that i happen to need to

325
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
do

326
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
so i looked at the supply chain um and

327
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
looking at supply chains and cyber

328
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,519
security is very important

329
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,240
and i kind of try to place where

330
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
the email came from

331
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,040
and

332
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,959
where it was in relation to my customers

333
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,079
or

334
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,279
to customers

335
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,680
and where it came uh and how how it sort

336
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
of flowed from all the way to the top as

337
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
you can see and uh and all the way down

338
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
and what i would have come to realize it

339
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
was really top-heavy there was a lot

340
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,920
going on there's a lot of money moving

341
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,720
upstream so like everyone was taking a a

342
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,959
dime and i sort of felt like okay well

343
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,760
this isn't really helping so i moved on

344
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
to the next item google searching

345
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
i really really like image searches in

346
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,880
google um it's it's it's one of those

347
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,959
things that i that helps me stay sane

348
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,279
again adhd

349
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
and i did some stats and i did something

350
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
very basic i figured network assessment

351
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,399
for them really meant i.t assessments i

352
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
went ahead and ran that and about

353
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,279
quarter of the results i thought were

354
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,720
useful and what that meant for me

355
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,800
was um

356
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
that

357
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,480
there was a lot of canned stock photos a

358
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,839
lot a lot of imagery that was sort of

359
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,959
useless

360
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,880
and but there were some some items that

361
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
in my search either had a figure a

362
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,639
flowchart or something that i could grab

363
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
onto something that was informative so i

364
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
thought to myself okay cool um i'm going

365
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
to go ahead and use that as a guide and

366
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,880
then i plugged in some other terms

367
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,600
and i found that interestingly about 60

368
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,639
of the results were informative i didn't

369
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,160
know what that meant at the time but

370
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,519
again i was just trying to convince

371
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
myself that i didn't have to do this

372
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,120
and i

373
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
also did network assessment which turned

374
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
out there was zero information it was it

375
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
was all canned images all stock photos

376
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,880
just you know people doing this or

377
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,839
whatever

378
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,639
so

379
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
that was kind of a flop again it was not

380
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
helping prove anything it was just kind

381
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,959
of reaffirming that i was

382
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,240
chasing something that i really could

383
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
do away with but here it was

384
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
then i asked myself what is network

385
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,240
assessment and

386
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,000
as because there wasn't really anything

387
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
useful for uh for network assessment

388
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,320
itself i went through and i figured i t

389
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,519
strategic assessment was probably the

390
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,600
best option found this image um i'm

391
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,160
sorry i forgot to attribute it uh but

392
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,920
it's i think the lesson learned there in

393
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,279
this particular figure was that man it's

394
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,440
a lot of things it really covers a broad

395
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
scope of

396
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
and imagine that somebody coming in

397
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,720
saying that we're going to do all of

398
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
this thing for these things for you at

399
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
the beginning

400
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,639
i thought that was

401
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,800
again not really going to be the right

402
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,560
path so it just again reaffirmed the

403
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,040
biases

404
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,920
i didn't stop there because i was really

405
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,440
in this hole so i went ahead and joined

406
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
the webinar got the demo and everything

407
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
else and got the software got the user

408
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,519
guide decided was going to run it and

409
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,120
see what it looked like and of course

410
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,800
right out of the gate it said that you

411
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
know you'll need admin credentials from

412
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
your prospective client to scan the

413
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,519
network using their data collector

414
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,440
at this point i was fairly certain from

415
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
this user guide that told me how to sell

416
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,240
this product that this was meant to

417
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,560
go to a new customer a prospect a small

418
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,519
business

419
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,199
and do all of this

420
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,320
run it

421
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
and collect data

422
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,639
and i thought it was a bit scary

423
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,000
in fact i thought that every single one

424
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
of those 7 out of 10 or 10 out of 10 may

425
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,519
have experienced a security incident in

426
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,160
that process because uh how else would

427
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
you define this you just let a stranger

428
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
in and

429
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
gave up your everything

430
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,639
so i thought that was a bit foolish

431
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
and again it you know it wasn't really

432
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
helping

433
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,199
and and that thought really really stuck

434
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,320
because i'm going all right seven out of

435
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
ten at least those guys went in and

436
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,440
let's just assume for a second that the

437
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
claim is in fact what it is and we i

438
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
think we all agree it's puffery but

439
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
let's just say take it at face value

440
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,399
um

441
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,600
the seven out of ten these became

442
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
customers and they eventually they would

443
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
have handled handed over that

444
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,240
information anyways

445
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
but what about the other three those

446
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,199
just walked away and potentially left

447
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
all those holes open so that was

448
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,480
again not not working well for me and

449
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
for the way i like to think

450
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
i ran the tool

451
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
um

452
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,040
it did exactly what it was what i said

453
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,639
was going to do scanned and it collected

454
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,920
a whole lot of information about

455
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,199
everything

456
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,760
and again just reminding you all that

457
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,760
this is in fact happening at a prospect

458
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,040
and it generated a report

459
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,399
uh the report

460
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,760
it was one of those christmas tree

461
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
reports where you had red yellows and

462
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
greens and there was a lot of reds in my

463
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
lab environment intentionally so and i

464
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,599
scored a 97

465
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,279
97 risk units

466
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
it also gave me an over overall weighted

467
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,160
issue score

468
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
didn't really have anything on the graph

469
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
and now this is a bit disingenuous

470
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,199
there's there's more information there

471
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,600
obviously there's many many things but

472
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
but this was the the whole thing i was

473
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
doing here was just trying to say all

474
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,760
right this is fine this is fine my

475
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,959
customers

476
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,839
if they're out there and they're going

477
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,839
to do this whatever you know it's not

478
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,040
going to be that bad and all this is

479
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
just refirming this is not fine this is

480
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,720
bad and specifically that because i

481
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
figured that this was actually

482
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,079
really

483
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,440
what it was really doing is causing me

484
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,120
to have emotions

485
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
it was it was getting me angry and it

486
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
was getting me curious and that was

487
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,519
frustrating

488
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,639
so

489
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,480
i was chasing it right and it was

490
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,839
probably trying to listen fear and i

491
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,839
think fear came in two stages fear is

492
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,680
ooh things are really really bad there's

493
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
ransomware there's identity that you got

494
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,279
to do something about it

495
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,279
and there was urgency in it oh sorry i

496
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
said two stages and the other one was

497
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,639
obviously the report scary scary result

498
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,079
scary findings

499
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,279
urgency you got to do something about it

500
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,800
right away right a lot of there was a

501
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,399
lot of phrases in the and the outcome

502
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,920
that said hey you gotta immediately

503
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,839
remediate this and that and the other

504
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,240
and of course it's all right we'll take

505
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
care of it all for you

506
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
helpfulness

507
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
um

508
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
i

509
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,720
have a little bit of background in

510
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,440
social engineering and i knew that at

511
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,519
least four out of five were essentially

512
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,720
the same traits you do to socially

513
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,639
engineer an organization

514
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
so i again felt like maybe

515
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,920
this was just reaffirming my biases

516
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,959
so the lesson i had at that point was

517
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,240
that

518
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
this idea of coming in and scanning an

519
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
environment and getting results back and

520
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,120
learning something about it is good

521
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,519
as long as it's applied properly

522
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,040
but i felt like someone here went in and

523
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,399
deconstructed something that was very

524
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,680
useful

525
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,519
packaged it in another way and then sold

526
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
it as a complete solution

527
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
and what i was most concerned about and

528
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,079
what i am most concerned about today

529
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,240
is that this is potentially happening to

530
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
small company after small company who

531
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
are looking for this quick fix that are

532
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
looking to solve a series of really

533
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
complex problems and they don't know

534
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
where to begin

535
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
and my

536
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
overall view of this is that those

537
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,160
companies that don't do the legwork and

538
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,359
try to learn a little bit about cyber

539
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
security will end up in a situation

540
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,880
where they'll just be

541
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
uh taken advantage of

542
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
that they will in fact be exploited

543
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
because they will feel like something

544
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,080
was accomplished you'll run the report

545
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,679
you generate a whole bunch of red flags

546
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,039
you fix red flags you run the report you

547
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,280
get green flags and everything's fine

548
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
and i think all of you guys can agree

549
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
here that is not what cyber security

550
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,880
actually is

551
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,320
mainly

552
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,919
just in case the point is missed isn't

553
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,760
that you can't you have to fix those

554
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
it's just you may not have to fix the

555
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,799
things that it brings up because you

556
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,120
have to have a strategy behind selecting

557
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,080
what is it that you're going to be

558
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,120
fixing

559
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
those red things might be fine it is

560
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,840
your

561
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,440
choice so

562
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
in act 2

563
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
i want to see i want to sort of

564
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,000
place network assessments and whatever

565
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,960
else you want to call vulnerability

566
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
scans and everything else in their

567
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
context

568
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
and hopefully take you through a crash

569
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,559
course in it governance

570
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,640
my intent behind this is for anyone and

571
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
your audience the audience here is

572
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
really small for this anyone who is

573
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
interested in building a cyber security

574
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
program can maybe come out come up come

575
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
away with this with some bullet points

576
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,400
that they can hit to do this themselves

577
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
i don't know i keep looking at that to

578
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
read my own slides they're right in

579
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,719
front of me but i keep doing it

580
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,160
so

581
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
when you are starting cyber security or

582
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
if you're you're in a point where you're

583
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,799
trying to tackle this

584
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,240
mess that we're in right now trying

585
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,840
trying to implement zta or whatever

586
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,280
you're trying to do the first question

587
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
to ask yourselves is what is a good

588
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,640
level of cyber security and the answer

589
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
is that it varies and it depends

590
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
entirely on your business

591
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,760
that

592
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,880
answer

593
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
despite all the standards despite

594
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
everything else out there is completely

595
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
contingent upon the people that run your

596
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,880
business

597
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
if you don't care that's fine that is a

598
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,360
good level of cyber security it is your

599
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
choice

600
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,039
once you figure that out you can decide

601
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,480
you can start prioritizing important

602
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,600
projects

603
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,559
and you can figure out what you're going

604
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,160
to tackle so really the lesson here is

605
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
that you need to break down this complex

606
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
problem in a series of small ones

607
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,320
and the third one is really kind of out

608
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,600
of place but i do find it really

609
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,559
important and that is where do

610
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
certifications fit in and specifically i

611
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
want to circle back to that stock to

612
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
certification that's that's not the

613
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
point that one isn't important what is

614
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
important though is that it makes you

615
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,360
think about what the companies are doing

616
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
and it gives you a perspective that you

617
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
can use to then evaluate your vendors

618
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,080
the companies you work with or even

619
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
yourself

620
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,360
the actual it's all rubbish

621
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
because it's custom to whatever it is

622
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
that you wanted to do so your your sock

623
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
seal simply

624
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
displays the fact that you did things

625
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
you said you were going to do

626
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
they may not mean anything but it also

627
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,520
means you give it give it a shot and you

628
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,640
did something important in small

629
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,919
companies that's the best you can hope

630
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,919
for

631
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,559
so

632
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,840
i want to move away from using the word

633
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
risk assessment network assessment sorry

634
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,440
network assessment and i.t assessment

635
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,880
because like i said i don't think they

636
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
mean anything but i like using cyber

637
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,720
security evaluation that's sort of my my

638
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
go-to word for this and and that is

639
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
because it is mofo it is more focused it

640
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
it focuses the information security

641
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
problem not the whole hr and everything

642
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
else that you guys saw on the on the

643
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,799
previous uh on one of the earlier slides

644
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
and it's really three objectives right

645
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,159
it's to evaluate

646
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720
guide and provide evaluate your existing

647
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,760
environment

648
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
and potentially re-evaluate it later to

649
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
see if it's working as expected

650
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,760
guide give some answers give some

651
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,679
remediations and some actions that you

652
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,000
can do that will help

653
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
and then provide some sort of a report

654
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,559
that you can give to people that maybe

655
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
don't understand the technical stuff so

656
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,480
the point is that everything that i

657
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
showed you initially in that network

658
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,799
assessment those are all

659
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
pieces that were in there but they're

660
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,679
just misused

661
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,159
to set up any kind of cyber security

662
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,440
small company or large you need a

663
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,280
framework you need to pick something

664
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,960
and that was covered by the previous

665
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,480
presentation um

666
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,559
i've at this point developed my own but

667
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,320
it's built on this and you don't really

668
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
need to know much

669
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
in terms of doing this a framework is

670
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
simply a collection of best practices

671
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,000
and you got to pick one that will work

672
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
finra has one that's incredibly simple

673
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,240
to understand plain english written outs

674
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,960
you can implement it at any level finra

675
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,240
handles financial services but their

676
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
actual framework is relatively simple

677
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,919
and this obviously has far more complex

678
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,360
and as the gentleman before me talked

679
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
about there's others

680
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
this is this should really be a cycle

681
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
that really didn't look great on this

682
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,480
powerpoint so i kind of left it as a

683
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,360
stack but the purpose of a framework is

684
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,559
to give you the collection of best

685
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,480
practices and then to help you

686
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,919
understand a problem whatever that

687
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,600
problem might be whether it be one item

688
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
one small item or something very big

689
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,679
develop some sort of approach to dealing

690
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,039
with it

691
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,840
give you a blank screen

692
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
show you a way to safeguard in this case

693
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
because we're focusing on focusing on

694
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,400
information security the system that

695
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
you're trying to protect uh confirm that

696
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,080
it works and ultimately learn from and

697
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,559
do it again

698
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,280
you will need some policies and policies

699
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
are

700
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,480
they sound boring

701
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,559
i don't think they are you how many of

702
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,280
you have had to agree to i.t policies as

703
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
part of your job

704
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
like pretty much everybody

705
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
joel read them who read them

706
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,919
that's nice okay

707
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
um

708
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,440
well

709
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
reading is is i unfortunately we track

710
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
so in my world we track the

711
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,440
time people spend on the document and

712
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,919
how quickly they hit accept

713
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,159
those numbers are not good uh there's a

714
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,200
lot of

715
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,280
this and part of the problem is we're

716
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
dishing out 22 now so you know there's

717
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
quite a bit in there but but the point

718
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,480
is you need something and for small

719
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,320
companies policies don't have to be

720
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,240
complicated

721
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
the point is they have to be written so

722
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,679
they're easy to understand and they have

723
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,840
to convey something meaningful and you

724
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
have to agree as a business to stick to

725
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
them

726
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,880
most importantly

727
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,320
i would say information security is your

728
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
general approach if your general

729
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,840
approach is call steve and have him help

730
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,919
us write it down and let that be your

731
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,240
information secure policy

732
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,600
if you want to be more developed please

733
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,559
do

734
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,159
my point is is commit to something

735
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
commit to doing a risk assessment

736
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,159
and that risk assessment uh can be

737
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,440
something that you studied for and went

738
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,520
to school for or in my case one of my

739
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
favorite risk assessments has been um a

740
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,880
risk assessment jenga we write a bunch

741
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,240
of words that we think are meaningful to

742
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
our business on a jenga and whoever

743
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,520
whoever loses that game is writing up

744
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,000
the report

745
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,679
and then in process as we pull blocks we

746
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,919
talk about them and we we talk about the

747
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,080
scenarios inventory the things that

748
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
might actually influence uh influence

749
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,720
our our operations and what it might do

750
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,679
to our business or to our customers

751
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,640
and i'm not going to go through all of

752
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,520
these but i'll touch on incident

753
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,480
management you should always have an

754
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,159
intimate incident management plan even

755
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,159
if again it's calling steve have

756
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,760
something

757
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
hopefully a lot better than that with

758
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
call trees and procedures and things

759
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,919
like that but

760
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,520
but have something written down and you

761
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,279
will find that most small companies out

762
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,320
there

763
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,799
and i'm talking like 50 users and less

764
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,159
they even just nothing they don't know

765
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,679
what to do they'll get an email a

766
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,360
phishing email and they're they're stuck

767
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
in their tracks they just don't know how

768
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
to respond to it

769
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,279
um the list here is what i think is most

770
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,760
important um and it's what i would start

771
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,360
with if i was ever building a cyber

772
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,840
security program for a small company

773
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,320
the way you get those are the way you

774
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,919
can get started with those doesn't have

775
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,919
to be costly or cumbersome if you were

776
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,360
to google any one of those you will find

777
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,880
and you can pirate tons of tons of

778
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
copies they're everywhere but you can

779
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
also go to sans and they have great

780
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,120
templates you can begin with

781
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,360
sans institute is is i would say one of

782
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,400
the authorities on this or you can go to

783
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,520
a commercial company that's gonna write

784
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
them for you uh the problem with that is

785
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,640
that i think they should be homegrown i

786
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,840
think that you should whatever it is you

787
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,080
should work on it yourself

788
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,000
so this is a good starting point

789
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,960
you're going to need controls

790
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,880
controls

791
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,039
in a cyber security program inform how

792
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,480
to do something but they don't

793
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
necessarily write the specifics

794
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,960
these are my most important ones i think

795
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,360
there's a lot more um in my current uh

796
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,679
current place we uh we have 80 controls

797
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,000
that define everything else that we do

798
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,520
i think it's uh

799
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,279
typically from my understanding it's

800
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,720
sort of working in my world it's

801
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
anywhere between 60 and 120

802
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,640
but you don't need that many

803
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
sometimes it's just the the ones that

804
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
really matter the most like mfa today i

805
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,080
think is is accepted across across the

806
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,240
board as a thing uh that we all we all

807
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,840
should be doing

808
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
uh interestingly though your control

809
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,799
should at least define how it's going to

810
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,400
be implemented and

811
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,159
if any of you guys are using microsoft

812
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,760
365 and this was brought up many times

813
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,200
before

814
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,000
it's it's voluntary compliance for mfa

815
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
until you can implement conditional

816
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,279
access

817
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,279
so maybe as a policy to your business

818
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,880
you'll say like look we're not going to

819
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,200
just volunteer people to do this we're

820
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
going to buy and implement every single

821
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
thing that will let us to enforce it so

822
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,960
that it's on

823
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,240
and then if we work with vendors that

824
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,919
may not have support for it or doesn't

825
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,840
work the way we want to we will explore

826
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,120
that and document that or maybe choose

827
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,960
different vendors or just just make sure

828
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,880
we have compensating procedures for it

829
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
that one the first one

830
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
that's like 90 of all all breaches that

831
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,679
microsoft 365 has

832
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,960
and i

833
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,400
would be willing to believe it's because

834
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
no one ever at the business said just do

835
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,760
this

836
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,360
research it and do it

837
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,200
use your access reviews

838
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,799
one of the ways i found them to be

839
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,840
useful

840
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
isn't because you go and check what

841
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,320
privileges people have

842
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,120
but software changes security security

843
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
options and software changes have

844
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
someone look at it once in a while be it

845
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,760
once a year or whatever but take the

846
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
moment dedicate time dedicate the

847
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,760
resources

848
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
to have someone review the mission

849
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
critical stuff and see if there's new

850
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,120
technologies that were built into it

851
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,039
that are important if you did that going

852
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,120
back to microsoft 365 you'd probably

853
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,640
realize that you had to shift plans to

854
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,159
get some of the additional benefits that

855
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,679
microsoft offers

856
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,200
that's only done if somebody's actually

857
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,840
paying attention

858
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,600
and i'm only going to talk about three

859
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,840
like before the other one i think is

860
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,000
most obvious data backup

861
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,480
i follow the 321 rule two on premise one

862
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,679
on site for every single mission

863
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,600
critical piece of data that's out there

864
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,039
now that sounds pretty obvious to some

865
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,159
but again when you're dealing with small

866
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,000
business and you say hey listen um i

867
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,960
don't think you're following the three

868
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,919
to one rule when it comes to your

869
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,559
exchange mailboxes or um or your

870
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,520
or your

871
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,559
sharepoint data they're like what are

872
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,678
you talking about it's in the cloud

873
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
microsoft doesn't cover you for your own

874
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,000
stupidity

875
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
you're not covered for the mistakes your

876
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,039
employees are going to make they cover

877
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,320
you in case their data centers blow up

878
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,399
you need something else so if you simply

879
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,919
say we're going to do three two one on

880
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,919
every single

881
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,080
mission critical

882
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,520
piece of data and then you look to make

883
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,840
sure you're doing it you're you now have

884
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
a control and then how you implement it

885
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,960
is going to depend on whatever stack

886
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
you're running

887
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,480
the other ones i don't think are any

888
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,679
less important but i don't want to spend

889
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,200
time covering them

890
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,360
because i tend to run long although i am

891
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,240
talking fast

892
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,080
if you need to know what controls to

893
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,840
implement once again you can go to

894
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,679
someone out there that sells them or

895
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,919
preps them for you but you don't have to

896
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,840
uh one of my favorite and business small

897
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
business friendly options is the adobe

898
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
common controls framework who's heard of

899
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,720
it

900
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,600
nobody it is an excel file and a pdf

901
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,799
they publish

902
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,720
that has a long stock of things your

903
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
business can do that you can simply

904
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
extract out of and even if you don't

905
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,240
understand what they mean

906
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,760
you guys do but perhaps your bosses

907
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,760
don't

908
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,720
it is something that you can absolutely

909
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,919
work with it it digests complex problems

910
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,880
into simpler things that are are sorry

911
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,399
it breaks down complex problems simple

912
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,320
things that are digestible

913
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,640
and it is available to anybody

914
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,679
although i think you might have to

915
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,720
provide your

916
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,559
name and email address to adobe in order

917
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,600
to get them

918
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,039
well if you download from this site oh

919
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,000
no no do not do that

920
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,399
oh yeah sorry so uh what's really cool

921
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,440
about the common controls i didn't want

922
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,799
to touch that because i don't think it

923
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
applies to small business uh what they

924
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,320
actually do is they map them uh to not

925
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,600
just i cut it off there when i took the

926
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,039
screenshot they map them across the

927
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,320
board to like every single framework out

928
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,799
there uh so so they they break down

929
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,880
break them down and distribute them in

930
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,399
ways that i think are like management

931
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,360
friendly

932
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,559
a small business friendly people that

933
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,679
don't have time friendly people who are

934
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,360
non-techies friendly

935
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,679
but they map it to legit stuff that that

936
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
is published by by the big guys

937
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,679
that's you know value-added probably not

938
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,679
that important

939
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
you will need some tools

940
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,039
there's only two tools that i think are

941
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
really important

942
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,880
you need something to document and i

943
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
when i say document you need something

944
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
that will do volume and velocity

945
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,200
and that's hard

946
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,440
and i don't necessarily mean like oh

947
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960
that's really nice

948
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
i don't really mean anything that is

949
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,000
mission specific the more flexible and

950
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,679
the more open it can be i think the

951
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,600
better off you will be because sometimes

952
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
your documentation is a screenshot

953
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,039
other times your documentation is a

954
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,120
procedure you want to sometimes a table

955
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,480
or an attachment

956
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,159
a have a place where you can dump all of

957
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,760
that in

958
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,080
you will need a relational database this

959
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,159
is a hard one it took me a long time to

960
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,039
struggle with this idea because

961
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,320
if you go to a commercial company that

962
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
does all of this for you

963
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
they will tell you you're done with

964
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,960
spreadsheets and of course you're done

965
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
spreadsheets they don't work for this

966
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,039
they this is too complex of an issue to

967
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,080
track in a spreadsheet you will

968
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,760
eventually exhaust yourself and you'll

969
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,840
regret it you need some form of database

970
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,679
it doesn't have to be complex but it

971
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,960
needs to be something that you can draw

972
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
relationships between records so if you

973
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
if you have a person in your firm and

974
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,559
your business whatever that can

975
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,000
potentially work with something like

976
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,440
that you're in good shape if you don't

977
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,279
you're in a little bit of trouble

978
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,080
but

979
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,519
uh the world's making that a little bit

980
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,600
easier

981
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,840
the third is i do think that you need to

982
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,200
pick one tool

983
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,159
something that you're gonna pay for and

984
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,480
use and that's up to you

985
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,320
i have my own favorites uh but i do

986
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,600
think that at the end of the day small

987
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,720
business is gonna spend some money

988
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
that's gonna sort of help the compliance

989
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,519
process run through

990
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,880
the tools that i personally prefer are

991
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,559
confluence and airtable

992
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,360
uh for documentation and uh and database

993
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,399
stuff

994
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,919
sans institute obviously as i mentioned

995
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,080
for templates cset is a cyber security

996
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,120
evaluation tool which i'll touch in a

997
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,799
minute that does all the stuff that you

998
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,480
can pay for in a beautiful little

999
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,559
package that runs in a micro iis

1000
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,440
instance it handles compliance for you

1001
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,799
incredibly well and if you're starting

1002
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,480
off with absolutely nothing it is a

1003
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,159
great way to learn

1004
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,279
and then there's a commercial stuff

1005
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
um those are all different vendors terra

1006
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,440
nova is bonded very close to microsoft

1007
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,919
they do a security awareness training uh

1008
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,559
fugue fugu as i like to call it fugue

1009
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,159
does

1010
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,840
compliance scans against cis sock and

1011
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,000
others of your aws environments talk

1012
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
about logic um

1013
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,120
everything i'm talking about they can

1014
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,159
kind of

1015
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,799
for for monies they can make make happen

1016
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,720
blissfully does vendor management really

1017
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,480
well tell them who your vendors are they

1018
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,720
collect all information for you um the

1019
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,840
vanta has another compliance student

1020
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,799
service driver there's a lot of them

1021
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,320
they're emerging and they're funded

1022
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,840
really really crazy drata just like

1023
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,600
raised like it feels like 25 million

1024
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,080
dollars it's crazy fanta got about 13

1025
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,000
million this year

1026
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,760
um but it doesn't you don't need any of

1027
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,279
that you can you can work with just a

1028
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,600
simple documentation system um and one

1029
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
example of that is uh one of the things

1030
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,640
i like to do is to battle cards for all

1031
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,159
of my inventory every single mission

1032
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,919
critical asset and for scenarios that

1033
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,679
might affect them confluence is great

1034
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,960
for that or wiki

1035
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,559
it's not even about the product though

1036
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,640
it's just a wiki that lets me do that

1037
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
create a battle card that works for you

1038
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,880
for me inventory is write down all the

1039
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,640
things that are material to a specific

1040
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,480
piece a specific asset and that could be

1041
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,279
an app it could be a a server it could

1042
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,519
be obviously an entire environment and

1043
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,360
then start brainstorming things that

1044
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,440
could go wrong

1045
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,120
if you're one of your critical assets

1046
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,240
your money

1047
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,360
perhaps you will think about what

1048
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,640
happens if your cfo is eaten by a snake

1049
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,080
write it down work it through it

1050
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,678
obviously metaphor but you get my point

1051
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,760
vendor management does not have to be

1052
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,679
hard i've learned this i've learned this

1053
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,279
the hard way i try to make it hard and

1054
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,519
it doesn't work um sometimes the easiest

1055
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
path the path of least resistance is

1056
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
absolutely wonderful

1057
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,159
when it comes to vendor management

1058
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,360
management you just really have to

1059
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
understand where they are relative to

1060
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,200
your business and if they have a bad

1061
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,960
moment how bad of a moment it is for you

1062
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,399
this is straight out of one of my vendor

1063
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,600
management databases plug in their names

1064
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,519
i risk them on three things i rate them

1065
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,720
on three things

1066
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,799
i kind of make sure i know what data

1067
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,240
they have and this is all relational so

1068
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,679
i can run reports and build things with

1069
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,720
them

1070
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,000
i put out the risks that they might have

1071
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,399
and then i for me security objective is

1072
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,760
is basically how important they are to

1073
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
me

1074
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,679
you can do that on your own

1075
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,560
anybody can do that

1076
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,320
and this is sort of where it all comes

1077
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,199
together

1078
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,399
if you're building a cyber security

1079
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,440
program

1080
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,480
if you can figure out how you're going

1081
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,679
to run it

1082
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,520
if you can design some of it

1083
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,119
you can figure out how you're going to

1084
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,119
do the nitty-gritty of it

1085
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,040
and you figure out sort of the tooling

1086
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,399
at that point in time an assessment

1087
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,159
makes sense at that point in time a

1088
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,079
vulnerability scan

1089
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,960
a full-fledged business i it assessment

1090
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,760
or

1091
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,440
or anything else in between a threat a

1092
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,719
threat scan or anything like that makes

1093
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,079
sense because at this point you know

1094
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,119
what you're looking for and you know

1095
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,159
what to focus on now it's in context

1096
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,918
of a real problem

1097
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,520
prior to that it's just noise

1098
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,480
and then you can use that to make

1099
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,200
improvements to your systems

1100
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
i thought i would show you some examples

1101
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
said i like working with simple

1102
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
databases

1103
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,200
i like building reports that i can give

1104
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,599
to people that are not technical that

1105
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,839
give them an

1106
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,280
idea of what their business posture

1107
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,839
might be like

1108
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,839
often it's just a blank screen

1109
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,560
sometimes it isn't

1110
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
this is a very simple self-assessment

1111
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,040
none of this has to be

1112
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,880
you don't have to begin at the missed

1113
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
level you can start simple and just

1114
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,079
focus on the things that you think are

1115
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,160
important

1116
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,599
or

1117
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,440
if you really want to go all in like i

1118
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
said cset

1119
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,599
it's on github it's awesome

1120
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,960
uh it a lot who's who's heard of csat

1121
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,599
so see who who is who here would be

1122
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,119
interested in knowing

1123
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,280
um how do you evaluate a business or

1124
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,800
your business

1125
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
all right so the list is pretty short

1126
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,520
all right cool

1127
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,280
what c-set lets you do

1128
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,560
is installs like in seconds again free

1129
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,160
allows you to pick a framework and it

1130
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
has a lot of choices and allows you to

1131
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
select how much time you want to spend

1132
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,640
on it whether it's one or two hours or

1133
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,440
your entire lifetime

1134
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
and then just presents you with

1135
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,119
questions that are understandable in

1136
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,880
plain language you answer yes and no to

1137
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,320
almost all of them but what's really

1138
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,160
neat about it is allows you then to it

1139
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,839
actually has explanations for what it's

1140
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,040
asking

1141
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,280
and it shows you how to deal with it

1142
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,800
so if you're a business manager that's

1143
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,960
not technical you can use this and then

1144
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,480
what's awesome is you can then collect

1145
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,320
some information and attach it to all

1146
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
these questions so you actually have a

1147
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,800
full compliance piece of software

1148
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,640
running in one spot

1149
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,400
would i do this long term no but i would

1150
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
absolutely do it as a starting point

1151
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
before before before anyone else comes

1152
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,320
in and asks three admin credentials

1153
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,640
you can do vulnerability scans

1154
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,520
built into a tool called nmap is a scan

1155
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,960
that will tell you

1156
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,359
all the cves that it can see on a

1157
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,000
particular system really useful

1158
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,200
uh one of my

1159
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,400
my biggest pain points in september

1160
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,880
was confluence

1161
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,480
on-prem cv 9.8 critical rating

1162
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,000
um

1163
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,680
botched cve

1164
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,000
i should say uh it allowed an attacker

1165
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,480
to exploit a system and take over uh

1166
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,240
anything is running

1167
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,760
cvu was published late and inaccurately

1168
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,599
uh sixty thousand potential uh

1169
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,960
confluence installations were affected

1170
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,800
um the

1171
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,760
the attackers before the before it was

1172
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,320
syndicated uh already had control over

1173
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,839
many

1174
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,200
many systems that were just sitting out

1175
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,079
there

1176
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,400
and they were mining monero

1177
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,160
i'm assuming some transfer data and

1178
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,839
potentially we'll be doing random stuff

1179
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,359
later

1180
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,599
cves are important they do inform you

1181
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
but they are only important in context

1182
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,440
of what you're trying to look at

1183
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,280
you can't read all of that stuff

1184
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
microsoft makes it a little easier uh

1185
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
microsoft has a has a defender tool like

1186
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,920
it um who uses defender

1187
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,160
yeah it's really neat it tells you your

1188
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
threat threat landscape again built into

1189
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,119
your subscriptions if you're a small

1190
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,240
company you're probably you probably

1191
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,119
have it available you just need to

1192
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,160
deploy it

1193
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,480
or it's like a click to get it on and it

1194
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,800
sort of uh simplifies

1195
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,240
that approach and

1196
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,400
shows you other things that matter

1197
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,520
in context to your devices

1198
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,240
and then there's also the compliance

1199
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
scans you get more advanced you can you

1200
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,079
can go ahead and buy some tools that uh

1201
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,160
that will actually go through and and

1202
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,599
take in my case 2650 controls for my aws

1203
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,440
department and tell me that i'm going to

1204
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,200
rate and draw

1205
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,640
and at that point the christmas tree

1206
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
makes sense

1207
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,200
you're good on time we're doing it on

1208
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,160
time

1209
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,160
so

1210
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,720
there is no grand reveal here

1211
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
focus on fundamentals keep it simple

1212
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,280
do the basics did it work

1213
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,040
it takes grunt work

1214
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,560
to learn how to build a build a

1215
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,400
successful cyber security strategy

1216
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
everyone needs to be involved

1217
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
we all heard that

1218
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
management needs to be involved

1219
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,280
obviously

1220
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,720
small businesses have a lot to lose

1221
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,280
it's really anticlimactic

1222
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,040
but if you want some snake oil i can

1223
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,520
give you some

1224
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,680
if you're going to do nothing you can do

1225
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,480
three things and still do something

1226
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
this is my homeopathic remedy to cyber

1227
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,720
security

1228
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,520
be curious ask questions poke prod if

1229
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,880
you get a stupid email from a vendor

1230
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,400
that makes a claim

1231
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
spend some time on it you'll learn

1232
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
something

1233
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,760
be mindful your actions impact others if

1234
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
you're a small company you can have

1235
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
really big consequences on people if

1236
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,359
you're a small business

1237
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,920
and your employees

1238
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
suddenly have no jobs

1239
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,800
their livelihoods are at stake right

1240
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,960
so

1241
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,040
your your actions really do matter

1242
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
be methodical if you're going to agree

1243
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,920
to a process stick to it um it's much

1244
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,000
harder much i think much much harder to

1245
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,240
do a larger organization than to create

1246
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,920
exceptions than it is a small one small

1247
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,119
companies will make exceptions for

1248
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,640
absolutely everything

1249
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,079
and

1250
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
sticking to the process is the only way

1251
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,640
that you're going to ensure that you're

1252
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,880
doing the right thing

1253
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,119
and because i wanted to kind of

1254
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,040
run this more or less like

1255
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,880
magic show that i'm not really skilled

1256
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,839
at

1257
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,920
i do have one bit of smoke and mirrors

1258
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,000
and that is

1259
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,880
for all of you that are

1260
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,240
information technology governance

1261
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,440
enthusiasts

1262
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,119
maybe you found something to learn from

1263
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
here but for for those of you have that

1264
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,920
haven't you technically participated in

1265
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,359
a cybersecurity incident training

1266
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,720
exercise

1267
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,079
because you see we had an event

1268
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,280
that appeared in this case an email but

1269
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,880
it could have been anything

1270
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
we confirmed it as a problem

1271
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
we validated it

1272
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,720
and we decided it was going to be an

1273
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,079
incident

1274
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,079
researched it further

1275
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,920
we presented some biases or in this case

1276
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,000
hypotheses

1277
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,839
of what it could be or it couldn't be we

1278
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,839
tested them

1279
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,359
we then focused on what the critical

1280
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,960
functionality the system was going to be

1281
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,240
and hopefully i got some point across

1282
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,040
we initiated recovery recovery stage

1283
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,839
being an alternative process for i.t

1284
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,040
governance

1285
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,599
we isolated the root cause

1286
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,000
scam resource cam

1287
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,280
and i even provided you guys with a

1288
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,520
presentation that is a debrief

1289
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,839
thank you

1290
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,920
i got time for questions

1291
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,599
i hope there aren't any i told somebody

1292
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,880
that i would probably implode if

1293
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,440
somebody asked a question so

1294
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,560
all right i'll take one tom

1295
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,880
yes

1296
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,280
generic recommendations

1297
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
i i really dislike this company they

1298
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,520
don't do any of that this tool is

1299
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,119
written in like the early 2000s and they

1300
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,800
just keep selling it this is this is

1301
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
this is to push for cash it is so

1302
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,319
frustrating and it is you i think the

1303
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,680
claim is it's got to be ridiculous like

1304
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,520
there's no way that's actually true but

1305
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,880
no there's this is like one of those

1306
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,839
things where i just keep seeing i'm

1307
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,280
going i know people are falling for it

1308
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,560
and i reason i probably should point

1309
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,839
this out um

1310
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,079
so one of the things that i looked at

1311
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,480
was uh the engagement platform it's on

1312
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,200
here uh i studied very much how they

1313
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,119
were processing those emails and how man

1314
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,200
somebody had a quota to fill uh and they

1315
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,800
this the whole thing is someone had like

1316
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,880
30 000 licenses that they have to sell

1317
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
and they were hit they were hitting with

1318
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,359
everything they weren't just blasting an

1319
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,200
email out of mailchimp this is they had

1320
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,800
the whole machinery behind it about

1321
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,319
tracking every single they knew how many

1322
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,680
times they viewed that email they knew

1323
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,560
uh i dug deep guys i really like i go

1324
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,000
down these rabbit holes all the time

1325
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,520
this isn't this isn't like oh email and

1326
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,160
then

1327
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,560
i spent hours just trying to figure out

1328
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,000
exactly who was seeing me open that

1329
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,880
email

1330
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,960
and uh yeah it's a lot these guys were

1331
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,839
this was this was this was um this was a

1332
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,839
blitzkrieg to sell

1333
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,119
software that didn't cost him anything

1334
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,880
to make

1335
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,680
yeah this is why it bothered me so much

1336
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,200
yeah there's no control

1337
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,800
this is just them

1338
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,400
i mean they probably stole on something

1339
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,280
just doesn't make sense to do it upfront

1340
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,880
well maybe i mean some cases might but

1341
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,000
most of the time

1342
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,200
the way the the way this is being

1343
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,399
presented the way it is being offered

1344
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,200
anything else

1345
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,450
thank you

1346
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:15,009
