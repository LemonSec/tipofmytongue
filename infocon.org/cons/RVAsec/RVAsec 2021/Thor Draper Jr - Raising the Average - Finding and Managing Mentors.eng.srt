i've actually got some things to talk

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,960
about

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
we're going to be serious for a little

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
bit

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
i call this talk raising the average

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,360
finding and managing mentors

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,159
so who out here has a mentor if you can

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,960
just show a hands

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,280
oh that's good who thinks mentorship's

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
important

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
and you know what that is actually

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,360
pretty statistically accurate 76 percent

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
of people think that a mentor is

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,960
something that's important to your

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
development something important to

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,759
to have to to grow

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,880
and 37 of people say they actually are

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,960
engaged with a mentor in some capacity

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
now

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
one of the things

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,000
that we've probably all heard of is you

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
are the average of the five people you

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
spend the most time with that's

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
attributed to

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,320
jim rohn

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,079
now whether or not he said it first or

45
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,560
maybe he said it the loudest

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,640
he gets the credit for it maybe he

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
trademarked it he was uh born in 1930.

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
we've gone through a time where

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
everything went extremely virtual

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
extremely quick

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
and

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
i don't know if you know this about

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
cyber security there's this this rumor

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,319
going around

55
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,680
that there are more opportunities than

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
there are professionals to fill the

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
positions in cyber security

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
what a slogan for a profession because

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
you're like i i'll do that i'll go i'll

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
go work somewhere and there's tons of

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
money in cyber security sweet i'll also

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
do that and then the moment that you get

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,599
motivated and you're like i'm ready i'm

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,840
a volunteer but i'd like to get paid i'm

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
a mercenary

66
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,800
then you hit this immediate roadblock

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
i don't have any experience

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
people want experience but you said

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,680
you needed people

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
so

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,720
how do you do it

72
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,200
my name is thor draper jr

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,280
i put an emphasis on the junior because

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
thor draper is my dad

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,519
he's over there he's sitting

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
i work for microsoft as a azure rapid

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,319
response network engineer it's a very

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,800
long title or escalation engineer on the

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
networking team

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
i'm an instructor

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,319
with

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,360
trilogy education out of the university

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
of richmond it's the cohort that i'm

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,239
currently teaching

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,560
and i'm a career changer

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
and one of the things that

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
was tough for me to overcome early on

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,879
was

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
i felt like a career changer was a piece

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
of something that i i had to own like i

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
had to tell people like hey i had a

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,040
career before

93
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,400
i.t

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,319
let's talk about it let's

95
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,720
let's get that awkwardness out of the

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,319
way

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,920
um

98
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
and what i started realizing

99
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,599
was that

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
my experiences before

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
my life in i.t

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,439
were some of the things that were making

103
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,799
me a better and better candidate

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,879
but i can tell you i still felt that

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,560
that insecurity because i would say hey

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
i was in sales i was in management i was

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
a people person

108
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
and what's weird

109
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,798
is that they don't necessarily associate

110
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,560
people people with i.t people

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
have you heard that

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
i think

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
that's crazy

114
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
and so i would talk about things like i

115
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,560
like

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
communicating

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,560
i like talking to people

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
and

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,040
i went on interviews and legitimately

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,240
heard

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
that this might not be a good fit

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
because because you don't necessarily

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
get to talk to people all the time

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
okay

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
and

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,440
the thing that sales

127
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
forces you to do

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
if you want to be a good sales person

129
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,919
the the formula is pretty simple you

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,120
just have to create a really big

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,759
pipeline like constantly ask people for

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,600
business and and

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,320
and talk to them and you know you're not

134
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
so much as selling them something you're

135
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
becoming a trusted partner we've all

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
heard the

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
the jargon but i did know how to put

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,039
myself out there go to meetings uh go to

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,160
meetups

140
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
uh and network and

141
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
when i made the transition we didn't

142
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,199
have a thing where

143
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,199
i wasn't allowed to see people face to

144
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,400
face

145
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
i was i was able to go to i.t meetups

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,039
funny enough you guys claim and you

147
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,600
laughed at not being people people

148
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,919
but the i.t community you are some of

149
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,680
the most helpful

150
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,479
individuals i've ever met

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
but the amount of times i get told just

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,160
put some time on my calendar i've never

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,080
never heard that phrase in my life

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,919
before but everyone's calendar's open

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,440
and i can reserve a half hour from

156
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,880
anybody and for some reason you don't

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
care it's cool

158
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
it's very cool

159
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,680
so

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
after i had a couple of

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
conversations i realized

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,880
there's no such thing as wasted

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,120
experience this is not

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,319
a quote

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
from jimron

166
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,479
i don't know who it is

167
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
i could have made it up

168
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,680
so i want to talk about a couple of

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,840
things today

170
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,600
mainly the types of mentors

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
virtual networking or virtually

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
networking

173
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
and then the meaning of life time

174
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,319
permitting

175
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,919
so if we get through the required

176
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,080
material we will get deep all right

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
i was fortunate enough to

178
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,199
get inspired to make the transition from

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,199
sales into i.t i was i was doing pretty

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
well in sales

181
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,800
what

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
i had an opportunity to

183
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,000
purchase a gym out in my hometown

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
and i'm like all right let's let's get

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
fired up let's do that

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
and when i first came back i still had

187
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,800
rent to pay in in california so i was

188
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
sitting around

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
i was not going to play double rent so i

190
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
moved in back home with the folks

191
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,919
and i got to see

192
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
my first like my

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,000
lifelong mentor my dad

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,199
and he's a

195
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,360
enterprise security architect he's done

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
things all

197
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,680
the he he was working in i.t before dns

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
was a thing so

199
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
i feel like

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
that's a long time for another

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,520
it's a long time so my first tip is if

202
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
you want to find a mentor

203
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,479
just be related to my dad

204
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
we're taking applications i have an

205
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
older sister she's lame

206
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,120
she doesn't do it

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,039
um

208
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,000
but i i had him as

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
this kind of

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
arrow one he could tell me what he

211
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,479
really saw the marketplace doing what he

212
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,000
saw

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
where the opportunity was going to be

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,919
not just today but in a couple of years

215
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,800
and

216
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,440
i could just kind of

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,039
attack all of his friends and ask them

218
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,599
for advice unsolicited

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,319
so

220
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,599
i had a one resource that was kind of my

221
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
my foothold and man did i try to make

222
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
the most of it

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
what i realized as i started talking to

224
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
him and some of his peers

225
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
is that i had a

226
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,520
career strategy

227
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,759
so there were things i knew i wanted to

228
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,360
do

229
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
and then the amount of things that i

230
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
knew how to do

231
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,839
was smaller

232
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
that's a very good buy chart

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
so there

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
i started realizing that there's a

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
couple of mentors

236
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,640
that

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
you can identify

238
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
three main categories

239
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,519
subject matter experts

240
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
attesters accountability partners

241
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,839
those

242
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,519
three stood out to me because you would

243
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,399
find

244
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,279
either

245
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,959
we'll define them here in a moment but

246
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,640
you would see people in different career

247
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
stages

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,920
whether or not they're experts in their

249
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
field their leading talks their lead

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,160
their thought leaders

251
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,519
the attesters these people are just

252
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,880
going to have your back

253
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,040
accountability partners

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,120
your mentor doesn't have to be years

255
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,320
ahead of you

256
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
when it comes to

257
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,800
being a part of the five people that

258
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,600
you're hanging out with most frequently

259
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
i mean

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,240
somebody who is either slightly ahead or

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
started at the same time you can learn

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
from everybody

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
but i noticed that there's three types

264
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,880
of people

265
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,440
that would consistently

266
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,240
stand out to me

267
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
experience

268
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
is the best teacher

269
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,040
this is still not jim rohn but nobody

270
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
said it had to be your experience

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
so when it comes to

272
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
subject matter experts

273
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,880
these people are highly knowledgeable in

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
the field

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
they're ideally working in the position

276
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,399
that you want

277
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,600
so once you start having these

278
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,079
conversations

279
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,959
let's take cyber security as

280
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
as i want i want to break into it

281
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,720
cyber security is a super large domain

282
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
there are so many avenues that you can

283
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
take and how do you know exactly what

284
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,519
you want how can you build a strategy

285
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,880
on

286
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
becoming something without defining what

287
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,079
that end goal looks like

288
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
what does success look like to you

289
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
and

290
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,600
i'll tell you the first thing i thought

291
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,839
that i wanted to do my my life strategy

292
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,959
was

293
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,760
uh

294
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
to do the opposite of what my dad did i

295
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
avoided i.t that's why i didn't have

296
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
that that career at first i thought

297
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
that's his life i'm gonna do my own

298
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
thing

299
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,320
and i did my own thing but man the apple

300
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,600
doesn't fall far from the tree and i

301
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
think i was just ignoring a passion for

302
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,240
a long time

303
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
well

304
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,279
when i started realizing that i i wanted

305
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,440
to get into i.t i still

306
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
went with my default he's in networking

307
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,040
so i said i don't want to do that

308
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
i don't want to be a networker

309
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
at all because i don't know what that

310
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,680
means yet and i also don't want to do

311
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,399
what my dad does

312
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,800
so i wanted to be a pen tester

313
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,399
i saw mr robot

314
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,600
i'm like this is it

315
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
i talk to myself sometimes

316
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
all right

317
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,040
see me after class

318
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
heckling's encouraged

319
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,639
so with

320
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,600
with pen testing you know there's a lot

321
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
of great resources out there

322
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
and

323
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,480
then i decided to talk to a pen tester

324
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
and see what their day to day was like

325
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,720
and

326
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
their routine

327
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
and how they do the same thing over and

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,839
over again they have a really great

329
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,560
process and man does it sound

330
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
interesting

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,120
for someone else

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,040
but i wouldn't

333
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,079
i would have not known to have

334
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
a pivot moment

335
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
and go somewhere else if i didn't have

336
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,839
that initial conversation if i didn't

337
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,160
speak to somebody who was talking or who

338
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
was living that day-to-day

339
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,480
and if that person didn't take time

340
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
and tell me

341
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,600
one

342
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,800
toss 30 minutes on my calendar

343
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,880
and they weren't

344
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,680
open to discussing like

345
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,560
what they were doing i would have been

346
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,800
investing a lot of time on something

347
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,479
that was never going to bear fruit

348
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,279
a fun fact about subject matter experts

349
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,079
you'll hear this every single time

350
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,360
my career path has been a bit unusual

351
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
hey guys

352
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,880
been invented so fast

353
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,920
all of your careers are unusual everyone

354
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
has an unusual career

355
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
not to downplay it when you hear that

356
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,160
just smile and say i bet

357
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
i bet thank you for taking the time to

358
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,040
talk with me

359
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,519
but it's comforting knowing that

360
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,040
regardless of where you're at

361
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,880
you can

362
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,279
do something significant

363
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,720
and

364
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,079
what's great

365
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,880
about these unusual career paths

366
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
is that in all likelihood you're

367
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
building one out for yourself as well

368
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
if you think

369
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
and i know not everybody in here is

370
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
immediately searching for a mentor but

371
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
if you think that your career path is so

372
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,320
unusual that you couldn't possibly be

373
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
helpful to anyone i guarantee you

374
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,360
you can

375
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,760
so this talk is mainly targeted towards

376
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
those people who are in that

377
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,880
career-changing position who are trying

378
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
to break in but i also hope for the rest

379
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,320
of you

380
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,600
i just know simply by being here talking

381
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
to other people you have something to

382
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
add so hopefully this also encourages

383
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,399
you to become a mentor

384
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,399
our next category

385
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,800
are the attesters and by definition you

386
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,240
know i this wouldn't be a talk if i

387
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
didn't give you a merriam-webster

388
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,320
these are people who are going to vouch

389
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,839
for you

390
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,600
so your subject matter experts

391
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,199
you're gonna just drain them for

392
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,399
information

393
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,480
in all likelihood their time is very

394
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,399
very precious and you're not gonna be

395
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
able to meet with them every single

396
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,320
month you might not be able to meet with

397
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,560
them every single quarter

398
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,399
so you want to go into those meetings

399
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,880
and maximize that time you're a testers

400
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
these are going to be the people that

401
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,600
are

402
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,720
you're going to feel comfortable saying

403
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,399
hey on can you give me a referral on

404
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,000
linkedin can you write one of those

405
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,199
things you ever been given that chore

406
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,560
yeah

407
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,199
that's a chore

408
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,800
but it's valuable

409
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
you want to build this relationship you

410
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,480
want to meet them pretty a lot more

411
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
frequently

412
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,399
you want to

413
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,759
be comfortable enough having a coffee or

414
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,920
a lunch with them

415
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,160
this person is going to legitimately add

416
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
immediate value

417
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,279
to

418
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,680
your job hunt the attester is going to

419
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,440
be that person who will give you their

420
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,639
phone number to be a reference

421
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,040
and they might answer if a headhunter

422
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
actually does

423
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,880
like verify that's a new thing that's

424
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
happening now

425
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,639
and then the third type are your

426
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,880
accountability partners and this is

427
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
this is pretty straightforward this is

428
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
your peer or somebody slightly ahead of

429
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
you in the same field

430
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
some of the most successful

431
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,560
relationships are those early ones while

432
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
you're going through training

433
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
and

434
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,160
if you're going through whether it's a

435
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,120
class whether it's the the corporate

436
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,000
mandated stuff

437
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,680
talk about your goals share what your

438
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,199
priorities are

439
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,639
and establish that relationship

440
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,800
the accountability partners

441
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
aren't there

442
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,480
to make sure

443
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,680
that you're doing everything they're

444
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,279
just there to check in and same thing

445
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,120
for you like if this relationship is

446
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,480
exhausting

447
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,160
i think you're doing something wrong it

448
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,199
shouldn't be

449
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,880
legitimate

450
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
exercise you should look forward and you

451
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,839
should be caring

452
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,759
how that other person's doing because if

453
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,759
you're doing something

454
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,360
together

455
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,079
it means that the payoff

456
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,359
when they win you win

457
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
so here's a couple of cues without a's

458
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
who am i spending time with

459
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,199
what am i missing

460
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,240
by choosing to worry or be afraid

461
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,319
will this be a live time or dead time

462
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,160
and i started writing these questions

463
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,599
because i no longer could go to those

464
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,160
meetups i got a lot of traction early on

465
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,359
during my

466
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,240
my career change because

467
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
i would talk to somebody and they would

468
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,440
make eye contact with me and i would say

469
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,120
hello

470
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,080
and

471
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
you'd have a conversation after that and

472
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
then the moment that everything shut

473
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,678
down

474
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,880
i didn't get any of that

475
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,600
so

476
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,679
when it came to reaching out to a

477
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,480
stranger or searching a specific job

478
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
title on linkedin

479
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
it's a little nerve-wracking if you see

480
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
somebody posting content they've done

481
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,678
something

482
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,039
and then you're just gonna shoot them a

483
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,200
random message saying hey

484
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
i'm a stranger

485
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
i'm trying to get into the field

486
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,200
and i see that you have a job title and

487
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,960
i looked up the salary on glass door

488
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,760
those things interest me

489
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,520
but

490
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
by holding yourself back

491
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,080
you'll never see what's on the other

492
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,720
side of that door and then the alive

493
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
time or dead time

494
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
i just wanted to put myself in a state

495
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,480
of

496
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,720
momentum

497
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
if you're having those conversations i

498
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,000
mean

499
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,919
some sometimes when you have that great

500
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
conversation with somebody and they give

501
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
you that little nugget of

502
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,559
inspiration

503
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,559
it feels like you have momentum whether

504
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,760
it's

505
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,000
whether it's real or not but if you can

506
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,679
always make your time

507
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
feel alive

508
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,919
that

509
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,600
that energy is going to give you the

510
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,240
courage to make one more meeting that

511
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
energy is going to make you

512
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,320
reassess are you spending time with that

513
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
average of five people do you have a

514
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,240
good ratio of smee a tester an

515
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
accountability partner you've got all

516
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,679
accountability partners that's just a

517
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,799
bunch of friends meeting up together

518
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
it's not what you know

519
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
it's who you know and you can choose

520
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,240
this right now we have the ability

521
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,840
to create these relationships in a

522
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
targeted way

523
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,640
i mean i think right now we have the

524
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,440
ability to control this virtually more

525
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
so than we ever did

526
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,440
before because it forced us all to get

527
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
more comfortable with

528
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,840
video

529
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,760
chat and setting up a zoom call

530
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,559
we can now virtually network

531
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,600
and some of the things i want to talk

532
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,440
about specifically are where to find

533
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
these people to reach out to what to say

534
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,679
when you're reaching out

535
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,360
how to set the appointment up what to

536
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
say when you're reaching out again

537
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,679
apparently

538
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
that's how important that is

539
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,200
is it a typo we'll find out i might have

540
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,880
that slide twice

541
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,799
and then thank you and follow up

542
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
but this is a

543
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,679
this is the actual process

544
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,679
search for the person

545
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,039
talk to the person

546
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
set the appointment up

547
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
nail the appointment and then thank them

548
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,159
and make sure that you do something

549
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
to follow up again

550
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
it's great that you did it one time

551
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
but to have this effective relationship

552
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,840
and and mentorship and pursuing it it is

553
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,559
building a relationship and

554
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,360
the mentors

555
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
will always say

556
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,240
that we learn just as much from our

557
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,360
mentee relationships as we do

558
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,879
the mentees learning from us

559
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,720
so just know that there's something in

560
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,840
it for you

561
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,559
so where do you find these people

562
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,919
reaching out to speakers

563
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
from webinars on youtube experts live

564
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,039
there

565
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,760
if you have a speech

566
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,919
on youtube or you see somebody who has a

567
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,280
speech on youtube

568
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,640
they uh

569
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,320
they really care about it

570
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
i think this is gonna go on youtube if

571
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,240
anybody comments it from this room i

572
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,600
will be so stoked

573
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,400
did you guys see that tweet that went

574
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,919
out saying that i was going up on stage

575
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,880
at nine

576
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,159
i did i liked it

577
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
but

578
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
you only put together these talks about

579
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
stuff that you're passionate about

580
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
so if you see somebody putting together

581
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
a talk about cmmc

582
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
if you see somebody putting together a

583
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,480
talk about where the industry is going

584
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,840
or

585
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,640
some type of strategy or technology that

586
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,919
person

587
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,760
really really cares about that topic

588
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,919
some of the most success that i've had

589
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,000
was reaching out to people from these

590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,520
youtube webinars because all of these

591
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,799
events now

592
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,320
are recorded and they're put out there

593
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,360
i reached out to somebody who had

594
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,640
a cmmc talk i talked to one of the

595
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
the

596
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
assessors the provisional assessors i

597
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,520
think there's only about 100 of them out

598
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
on the country

599
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,679
and

600
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
that was one of the first ones that i i

601
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,799
used

602
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,280
for a webinar and i think the request

603
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,360
was just as awkward as it possibly could

604
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,520
be it's like hey i watched this

605
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,240
can i talk to you

606
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,400
and the surprising part you know on the

607
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,159
second slide on most of these things i

608
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,799
didn't include my email because

609
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,799
uh you know i forgot i was going to

610
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,520
bring this point up but a lot of them

611
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,200
people put their name on their slides on

612
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
who's who the presenter is they'll

613
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
include some contact information and

614
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,919
that's because they want you to contact

615
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,760
them it's okay

616
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,559
i i included my my name you could find

617
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,679
me

618
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,640
so

619
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,159
and i made sure to put junior cause

620
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,640
otherwise you'd find my dad

621
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
and

622
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,039
they want to be reached out they put

623
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,120
this together so that's a one

624
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,039
one of the best resources is actually

625
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,080
following up these people who are

626
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,320
putting together webinars

627
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,799
meetup virtual conferences in-person

628
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,960
conferences

629
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
the organizers

630
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,159
of the events

631
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,120
the the jakes of the world

632
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,159
those people are phenomenal resources

633
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,720
anyone who puts together an event or a

634
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
talk

635
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
at these virtual conferences you want to

636
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,640
actually speak to

637
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
the person who knows everybody

638
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,159
that's

639
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,559
you're not strictly using every single

640
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,960
person but what you're trying to do is

641
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
in these relationships haven't get one

642
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
you want to get better at these

643
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
conversations but two you want to make

644
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,919
sure that

645
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,400
you're discovering what you really want

646
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,120
again that cyber security job domain is

647
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,159
so

648
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,760
so large

649
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
that until you start having specific

650
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,120
conversations and learning about what

651
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,480
people do

652
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,159
what their day-to-day is like what their

653
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,159
future what what things that they care

654
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,240
about if they line up with what you care

655
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
about then you can make the most out of

656
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
those relationships you can start

657
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,159
filling out what your

658
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,640
destination looks like

659
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,440
and i wrote be gym at parties

660
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,080
if you're going to these virtual events

661
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,799
and you're not that comfortable remember

662
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
jim from the office he goes in there

663
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,159
makes jokes he tries to be memorable

664
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
real quick and then he takes off

665
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,600
take someone's name introduce and if you

666
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,760
feel more comfortable writing something

667
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360
which uh

668
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
which i think we do

669
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
then take your time

670
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,440
formulate your plan

671
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,399
and then reach out to them

672
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,919
so what to say

673
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,400
when you're reaching out and this was my

674
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,679
actual

675
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,400
linkedin message

676
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
my name's thor i saw your youtube video

677
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,919
i want to know if i could pick your

678
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,120
brain about the subject

679
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,279
i don't know why i wanted to redact

680
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,470
that part from you all

681
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,000
[Laughter]

682
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,520
and i know this seems a little out of

683
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,039
the blue but how else are we supposed to

684
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,919
network in a virtual world

685
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,880
and i sent that out

686
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,930
to what felt like 30 people a week

687
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,240
[Laughter]

688
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,080
and i got responses from a lot and there

689
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,039
was a lot that ignored me

690
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,400
and you know what

691
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,799
i started

692
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,480
well i'll be honest at first i was hurt

693
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,919
by everybody who ignored me like you

694
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:04,960
can't even tell me you don't want to

695
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
talk to me

696
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,840
but then i realized

697
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,279
that's probably the best way to save

698
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,480
time

699
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,120
i mean your mentor relationship is going

700
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,480
to be based off of a foundation of

701
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,080
communication

702
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,360
so if the person doesn't have time for

703
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,559
you to even discuss

704
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,240
just the smallest of details then

705
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,559
that saves you time and the people who

706
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,640
responded to this i still kind of use

707
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,840
something

708
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,039
you only have like 180 characters if

709
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,320
you're reaching out to somebody for the

710
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,440
first time so maybe 300

711
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,799
but the ones who do

712
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,600
you know that you're gonna have a great

713
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,240
conversation because

714
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
they're okay with you picking their

715
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,840
brain

716
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,799
the way that

717
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,559
i suggest you set up that appointment

718
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,200
half hour or an hour

719
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,840
these first ones

720
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,480
are

721
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,679
just

722
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,679
that that first meeting you can't have

723
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,760
your mentor or this person who's going

724
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,919
to be your potential mentor think that

725
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
it can't be a chore

726
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,520
you're ultimately asking them for

727
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,240
their knowledge and the reason that uh

728
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,559
our smes and those people who are super

729
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,440
ahead

730
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,600
in those careers

731
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,679
their salaries aren't just based off of

732
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,760
what they do but it's based off of what

733
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,520
they've done

734
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,640
that's why

735
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,720
your your salary goes up as your career

736
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,000
goes on

737
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,720
so

738
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,840
a half hour an hour of their time

739
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
could be worth a lot

740
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,120
and you want to maximize it you want to

741
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
show up early

742
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,159
and i'd also suggest showing up on

743
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,039
camera because it is so much harder to

744
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,559
be mean to this face

745
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,720
than it is to

746
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,679
just the letter t d

747
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,399
and

748
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,640
i would suggest doing the small things

749
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
the small things like if you can be on

750
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,120
video be on video

751
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,520
if you can set up a call

752
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,039
and you can't be on video then at least

753
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,720
talk to them if you can't talk to them

754
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,760
then

755
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,679
you go down the chain and you you write

756
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,559
it's going to be tough to have a

757
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,240
mentorship where they're just a pen pal

758
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,279
but

759
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,919
they do you

760
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,919
and then the thank you and follow up

761
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,200
summarize

762
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,520
thank them for their time

763
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,200
mention takeaways and action items

764
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,159
keep in touch and set a date

765
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,000
this is probably the most important part

766
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,080
of establishing that great mentorship

767
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,399
relationship

768
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,240
so

769
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
when you're setting up these calls be

770
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
targeted all of this is about targeting

771
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,279
your mentors being specific with who

772
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,399
you're gonna

773
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,039
spend i think you can really only have

774
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,000
five

775
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,840
meaningful

776
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,000
mentor relationships and it's gonna be a

777
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,840
mix of those three mentor types

778
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
when you're targeting one of the smes

779
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,440
you want to go in there with an agenda a

780
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,039
specific question something that's

781
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
burning

782
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,360
30 minutes goes by

783
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,320
so fast

784
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
i started realizing that i needed an

785
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,159
elevator pitch for my own introduction

786
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,840
because i wanted to make sure that i was

787
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,520
maximizing the amount of information i

788
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,640
was getting

789
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,559
because you know the moment that you hit

790
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,000
25 minutes in you're like i want to be

791
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,919
respectful of your time

792
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,240
and

793
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
i had a handful of calls that i

794
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,240
mismanaged time that stinks

795
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,840
then a handful of calls that because of

796
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,559
that mismanaged time i got more specific

797
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,320
i came in with written questions

798
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,159
sometimes i tossed them to the person so

799
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,600
they were prepared to tell me about what

800
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,240
what they saw

801
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,279
and

802
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,240
i've had to constantly work on

803
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,200
the action items

804
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
because i wanted to set follow-up dates

805
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,440
when i achieved something you can't

806
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
achieve all the time

807
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,840
because some things take time

808
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,919
so sometimes it's just progress telling

809
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,200
them that you're going to be doing

810
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,320
something or that what you took away

811
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
you're going to work towards and you're

812
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,960
going to keep them in the loop because

813
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,120
again if you're not

814
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,799
constantly taking care of these

815
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,679
relationships

816
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,120
they can

817
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,520
fizzle out

818
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,840
so another

819
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,600
mentor relationship that i want to bring

820
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,760
up

821
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,399
and a man i do really target

822
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
i do target any role that i'm

823
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,720
specifically looking out for so once you

824
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,279
find out it's great if you know

825
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,039
that position that you want down the

826
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,679
down the line

827
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,600
i've talked to a security cloud solution

828
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,960
architect

829
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,679
over at microsoft

830
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,919
and

831
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,880
one of the ways that you need to

832
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,360
maximize these relationships i would

833
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
give him those block questions

834
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,320
and then you start asking things like

835
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,960
what makes a good candidate for this

836
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,440
position

837
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,720
through my first mentorship relationship

838
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,919
there

839
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,320
i've been able to meet hiring managers

840
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,840
i've been able to

841
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,200
get invited to the security summit

842
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,039
and

843
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,760
that all comes from

844
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
giving that relationship enough

845
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,519
attention

846
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
following up

847
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,399
and at one point i was like you know

848
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,919
what i i

849
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,679
i haven't gotten that certification yet

850
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,120
is it is it okay if we still meet

851
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,760
i apologized

852
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,240
but uh

853
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
once you you meet with somebody they

854
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
start caring about you too

855
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,360
so

856
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,159
consistently

857
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,440
you want to have a relationship where

858
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,559
you're consistently talking with them

859
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,559
keeping them up to date and staying in

860
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,799
the know when they

861
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,440
my guy's name is nathan swift

862
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
he'll write articles

863
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,120
he'll do technical

864
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,399
walkthroughs

865
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,240
do them

866
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,360
it goes both ways

867
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,760
so in summary

868
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
we talked about the types of mentors

869
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,960
your smes your testers your

870
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
accountability partners talked about

871
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,120
virtually networking

872
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,440
finding the people what to say how to

873
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,559
say it

874
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,158
what to say thank yous

875
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,919
and at this point

876
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
i want to open it up

877
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,600
to some q a i know i took a lot

878
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,840
any questions

879
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,960
about the

880
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,240
mentor

881
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,399
mentee relationship about finding those

882
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,399
mentors

883
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,840
i love it

884
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,880
so

885
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,600
from mentor's perspective

886
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
what i'd key in on is making sure that

887
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
that person is

888
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,600
not just giving you smoke

889
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,440
and

890
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,840
i know how how easy it is to send a ping

891
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,720
send a note

892
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
not to say that you have to have like a

893
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,480
qualifying exam or anything but

894
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,800
gage they're interested in that if you

895
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,760
can squeeze out that half hour time

896
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,960
that's awesome

897
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,199
that first intro meeting i know you you

898
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,000
only have so much bandwidth but i think

899
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,918
finding a great mentee if you give them

900
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
an action item

901
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,280
any action item that they can make some

902
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,800
progress on within a certain amount of

903
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,359
time even if that action items hey

904
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,040
set up another date

905
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,839
in six weeks and let's catch up again

906
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,199
that'll show you that that's somebody

907
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,119
who's really going to run through walls

908
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,639
for you

909
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,159
you're not going to lose much by having

910
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,159
that that first conversation or that

911
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,918
first email exchange back and forth um

912
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,280
but i think the

913
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,560
the key to setting up one of those

914
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,639
strong relationships is is giving those

915
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,720
that that action item for them to do

916
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,040
give them an opportunity to prove that

917
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,560
they're serious about

918
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,078
building that relationship with you

919
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,599
awesome thank you yeah

920
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,119
uh the pitch to

921
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,880
yeah you know what i and i constantly

922
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
tweak it i think my most recent one was

923
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,240
hey i'm thor and one of my big career

924
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,560
goals is becoming a cloud solutions

925
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,400
architect

926
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,960
kind of saying exactly what my immediate

927
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,480
next step is

928
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,560
uh

929
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
and then

930
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,160
whatever is like front of mind you know

931
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
or like what i'm actually working on you

932
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,320
know as an azure response engineer i get

933
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,720
to talk to these people and i can see it

934
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,880
benefits the career path in this way but

935
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
what do you see or something like that

936
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,880
but i would probably say keep it your

937
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
name

938
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
what your goal is what's your priority

939
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,000
is what you re what like what is that

940
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
nugget that you need to take away from

941
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,279
this conversation and

942
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,920
then also why

943
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,839
like what you're doing to help yourself

944
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,799
get to that as well

945
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,720
that's a good question thank you

946
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,599
hey man well i i do this

947
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,560
i'm i'm not lying i constantly am asking

948
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,078
asking for more mentorship

949
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,800
cool

950
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,359
yeah

951
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,040
i love this question because

952
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,839
i think one of the hardest ways

953
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,040
or one of the reasons it's so

954
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,280
challenging to break into the field

955
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,599
is

956
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,680
it's very similar to like even finding

957
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,760
people to do stuff like lawn care and

958
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
plumbers i realized that i don't want to

959
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,359
just hire like a random company

960
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,240
i would go out and refer like i'd ask a

961
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,119
neighbor

962
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,040
if they knew a person or i'd ask like

963
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,280
people on my neighborhood bulletin board

964
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,599
like hey does anybody recommend like a a

965
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,599
good plumber for this and when it comes

966
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,440
to lawn care if i see somebody cutting

967
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,359
someone else's lawn i immediately think

968
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,359
like that person is going to be okay

969
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,359
versus a list of names and they could

970
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,280
have been on that same list

971
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,920
what i'm getting at with that

972
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,400
it's about trust more so than anything

973
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
these junior positions or the entry

974
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,359
level positions

975
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,799
so much of it's dictated on

976
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
whether or not you think that this

977
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,520
person is going to follow through

978
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,119
and whether or not this person's going

979
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,280
to

980
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
legitimately sit like they're going to

981
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
learn and they're going to work really

982
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,160
hard everybody tells you like they're

983
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,119
going

984
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,560
to work hard but until you have that

985
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,599
conversation you build

986
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,440
even the smallest amount of trust

987
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,200
that's

988
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
that's going to be one of the largest

989
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,480
barriers

990
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,720
i would advise anybody who has zero

991
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,880
technical experience to start having

992
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,720
those conversations

993
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,079
with

994
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,839
people with whatever position they think

995
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,880
that they're they're going to go and

996
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,280
pursue it's great that they're reaching

997
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,200
out to you

998
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,160
it's tough to not just say like you know

999
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,000
lab start

1000
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,920
like take it take a certification

1001
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,440
i would

1002
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,240
yeah i would advise

1003
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,480
have conversations with consistently

1004
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,240
have them with you consistently have

1005
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,119
them with people in in the domain that

1006
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,480
they think that they're most passionate

1007
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,000
about

1008
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,440
and if you have something that you're

1009
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,599
actively working on or that you're

1010
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,520
you're putting together just invite them

1011
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,200
in immediately

1012
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,720
and because we're

1013
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,320
we are tinkerers

1014
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
i think in this field in general

1015
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,760
and

1016
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,160
if you have a passion project talk to

1017
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
that person and say like hey this is

1018
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
also what i'm doing like you don't just

1019
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,280
do your job nobody exclusively

1020
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,720
is doing

1021
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,520
their job and that's it

1022
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
so

1023
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
that would be my advice would be

1024
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,160
reaching out

1025
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,560
tell them to to reach out to people

1026
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,200
in in that specific domain

1027
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
invite them into what you're working on

1028
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,599
as well

1029
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,960
and

1030
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,480
have because those conversations are

1031
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
going to open open so many doors if

1032
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,520
somebody thinks that there's an

1033
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,400
opportunity to

1034
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,079
to learn like for me

1035
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,440
um

1036
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,760
my career path

1037
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,520
the piece of advice i was given was to

1038
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,680
work at msps

1039
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,200
and the reason was

1040
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,040
msps still

1041
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,280
are dealing with the smb businesses the

1042
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,640
small midsize

1043
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,880
businesses i'd get to see municipalities

1044
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,280
i'd get to see healthcare i'd get to see

1045
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
technology all different types of

1046
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,280
verticals

1047
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
and

1048
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
that was just to start the journey

1049
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,359
itself start actually

1050
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,160
doing something and the value in it

1051
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,520
while it probably wasn't the most

1052
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,160
desirable position to start off with

1053
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,920
it

1054
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,000
allowed me to do something where it set

1055
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,440
me apart because i still got to see

1056
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,280
servers i actually racked

1057
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,560
servers still

1058
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,839
you know you can go through the formal

1059
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,160
education do everything virtually and

1060
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,760
never actually see the physical

1061
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,960
equipment that

1062
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,800
the things are running on

1063
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,520
and we become we're so serverless and

1064
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
and micro transaction heavy now

1065
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
that

1066
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,079
that nudge because i didn't know what i

1067
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,000
wanted to do it's just hey take anything

1068
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,319
and find out if you hate it because if

1069
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,160
you don't know what you love you can

1070
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,040
start

1071
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,359
eliminating things

1072
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,000
by seeing what you hate enough cool

1073
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,280
does that help

1074
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,920
all right cool

1075
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,520
oh yes

1076
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,919
discontinuing it

1077
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,040
yeah you know i don't think that you

1078
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,960
have to do the breakup lines where it's

1079
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,839
like hey it's not you

1080
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,560
it's

1081
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,040
it's me

1082
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,000
let's go from uh from both perspectives

1083
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,040
uh i think to start off with uh from the

1084
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,839
mentor perspective

1085
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,040
a good mentor hopes that

1086
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,920
their person's gonna

1087
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,000
leave or that person's gonna grow and

1088
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,760
get into another position a great mentor

1089
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,119
knows it

1090
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,920
ted lasso anyone

1091
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,319
yeah

1092
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,640
but it was a great line

1093
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,160
so from the mentor perspective you

1094
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,760
actually do encourage somebody and then

1095
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,599
you probably just elevate them like

1096
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,040
maybe

1097
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,240
you're probably

1098
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,839
in a better position to advise them to

1099
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,640
start talking to somebody else if you're

1100
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,079
the mentee

1101
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,440
and you realize that this has run its

1102
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,760
course

1103
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,319
i mean you

1104
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,920
don't ghost um

1105
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,000
but you know just start saying like hey

1106
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,400
i can i think we can either spread these

1107
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,240
out a little bit farther

1108
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
or

1109
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,079
maybe just thank them for the time

1110
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,520
reflect on what you've accomplished

1111
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,119
and be cordial like you're still going

1112
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,560
to want that person in your network you

1113
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,200
know and they don't have to stay that's

1114
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
why there's so many different levels

1115
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,680
like if you started getting to the point

1116
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
where you've caught up

1117
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,440
maybe they're not a sme anymore maybe

1118
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
they're not in a tester because it'd be

1119
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,040
weird to get a recommendation from

1120
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,440
somebody who's at the exact same level

1121
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,920
that becomes an accountability partner

1122
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,359
and hopefully you've invested in that

1123
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,800
much time and

1124
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,560
but yeah no if honestly you guys are

1125
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,040
like fighting over

1126
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,520
just small things

1127
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,160
it's time to break up

1128
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
cool

1129
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,880
i'm new to relationships anyway

1130
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,880
yeah all right so i think it's implied

1131
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,960
over time uh

1132
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,560
i even think that people that you

1133
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,119
consistently follow on podcasts social

1134
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,200
media tweets things like that um but i

1135
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
think it's super beneficial if you have

1136
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,800
that speaking relationship but just

1137
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,599
because somebody

1138
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,920
a mentor is just somebody who's going to

1139
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,160
be adding value to

1140
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,799
your growth

1141
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,680
it is nice though if you do

1142
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,520
put labels on things

1143
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,079
because

1144
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,160
or even letting them know i've never

1145
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,839
been upset that somebody called me their

1146
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,880
mentor

1147
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,400
i've honestly probably done a little

1148
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,319
dance in my head and then when the doors

1149
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,560
were closed i was like yeah sweet i did

1150
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,920
it

1151
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,720
um

1152
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,000
but yeah if you have that formal

1153
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,520
conversation and the way that you have

1154
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,560
that too

1155
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,279
uh is

1156
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,640
i would probably say hey i

1157
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
value our talks

1158
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,560
i consider you my mentor and i love this

1159
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,960
if this is a regular thing where that's

1160
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,640
if you're building that schedule out so

1161
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,160
that way you can start putting advanced

1162
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,319
notifications on someone's calendar and

1163
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,800
really going from that half hour to the

1164
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,160
hour time slot because i think that's

1165
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,520
what that label would do

1166
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,760
good deal

1167
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,560
what else we got

1168
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,240
oh yeah yeah i think once once you get

1169
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,839
on the uh the mentor mentee like

1170
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:06,960
wagon

1171
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,640
uh it it doesn't end

1172
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,078
i think there's a lot of

1173
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,800
when you're a part of this and you're

1174
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,960
consistently talking about where you've

1175
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,440
come from where where a person's

1176
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,400
gone and been

1177
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,359
it's really easy to remember the

1178
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,720
struggles

1179
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,119
it wasn't long ago that

1180
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,839
i was just bombing technical interviews

1181
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:32,480
and

1182
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,520
and

1183
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,440
and really wishing like that's on camera

1184
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,079
for forever

1185
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,240
um

1186
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,040
but once once you're there because

1187
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,560
it's

1188
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,880
because it's something that i talk about

1189
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,560
i can always relive those moments and i

1190
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,960
can remember hey this is exactly how i

1191
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,800
overcame it and sometimes it's just

1192
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,319
about

1193
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,520
it it's just about being relatable

1194
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,280
so yeah you don't you don't just

1195
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,839
graduate to uh to being a mentor and

1196
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,960
then

1197
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,760
you did it

1198
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,960
[Music]

1199
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,920
i think that it there's always some

1200
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,520
some more it doesn't always have to be

1201
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,680
in a work capacity too here it's great

1202
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,560
because we're trying to get into the

1203
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,640
field but from

1204
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,680
i'm sure it helps in every every facet

1205
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,879
of life i know it does

1206
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,800
i think we have time for for one more

1207
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,800
question

1208
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,598
oh yeah

1209
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,839
oh yeah do i think that that there's an

1210
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,200
opportunity to learn something from the

1211
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,079
conversation and grow

1212
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,480
from both perspectives absolutely

1213
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,319
it brings you back

1214
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,720
to it brings you back to that moment

1215
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
and

1216
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,400
it lets you reflect on like man i either

1217
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,800
had blinders to this certain aspect of

1218
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,480
things or

1219
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,640
i

1220
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,720
i i like

1221
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,800
i couldn't even begin to imagine like oh

1222
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,400
that is that is a real struggle here

1223
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,079
because you might be in a place to

1224
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,680
change something at least in your your

1225
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,599
own organization or the people that you

1226
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,079
interact with so

1227
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,359
yeah

1228
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,040
mentorship or being a mentor is one of

1229
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,720
the most valuable things that you can do

1230
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,839
because it

1231
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,000
it's so satisfying and i'm telling you

1232
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,400
that you do tend to

1233
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,359
it feels like you personally grow from

1234
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,160
establishing some of those relationships

1235
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,000
and probably more than the the mentee

1236
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
themselves

1237
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
well

1238
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,599
it's been real everyone

1239
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,400
i'll leave you with one more quote

1240
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,359
but this one's by me

1241
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,680
the moment that you realize that

1242
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,680
nobody knows anything you can't be an

1243
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,200
imposter

1244
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,319
all right

1245
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,200
everyone's faking it

1246
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,919
thank you so much everyone

1247
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,079
you
