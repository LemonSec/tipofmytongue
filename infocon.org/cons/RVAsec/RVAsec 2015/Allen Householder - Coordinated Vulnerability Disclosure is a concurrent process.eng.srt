00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,460
hello RV a sec I'm Alan householder I'm

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,720
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Serb Coordination Center we're</font>

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,400
based out of Pittsburgh at the software

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,369
engineering Institute which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of</font>

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,959
Carnegie Mellon University and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

6
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,370
talk today about vulnerability

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,140
coordination and concurrency this is an

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,570
extension of a blog post that I did last

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,949
December we I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I can get any I</font>

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,380
can't get much closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the microphone</font>

11
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:51,739
from where it's at is there a knob we

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,739
can twist

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,980
alright so first up Carnegie Mellon has

14
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,780
lawyers they want you to see this read

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,740
it fast to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them when you want it so I</font>

16
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,759
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about vulnerability</font>

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:14,149
coordination and concurrency cover some

18
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,460
introduction and motivations and then do

19
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:20,360
a quick survey of other vulnerability

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,520
disclosure models from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past and talk</font>

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,440
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've done here and</font>

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,530
then some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've learned</font>

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,509
along the way so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get started</font>

24
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,229
can I get a quick show of hands of who's

25
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,670
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have products</font>

26
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,990
that have vulnerabilities in them that

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've received</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reports from any</font>

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,060
software vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how about folks</font>

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:47,178
who find vulnerabilities and report them

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay folks who have systems they're</font>

31
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:54,289
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect mostly okay so from up</font>

32
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,759
for a lot of you this this might might

33
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,409
be a little inside baseball but it's

34
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,569
kind of a here's what happens upstream

35
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,280
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're what you might be</font>

36
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:04,000
familiar with with CVEs and

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,939
vulnerabilities being made public so

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,500
just to start off if if anyone hasn't

39
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,690
heard of heard of cert we've been around

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a while December nineteen nineteen</font>

41
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,959
eighty-eight was one of our first

42
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:19,910
advisories we were formed right<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

43
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,040
the Morris worm in November 1988 because

44
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,299
DoD was looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some place to to do</font>

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,548
this and software engineering Institute

46
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:27,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was there so they asked us to start it</font>

47
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:30,769
up so we've been around doing

48
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:35,420
vulnerability disclosure at least for 27

49
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:37,820
years that was a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ago and so</font>

50
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,738
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast-forward to the slightly more</font>

51
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:45,709
recent past so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March of last year the</font>

52
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:49,280
federal trade commission issued a

53
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:52,519
complaint against Fandango citing that

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,880
they their software their mobile app was

55
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,890
susceptible to SSL man-in-the-middle

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,290
attacks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of their complaint</font>

57
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,548
they made an interesting point that

58
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,200
Fandango didn't have a clearly

59
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,870
publicized and effective channel for

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,420
receiving security vulnerability reports

61
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure if this is ever if this has</font>

62
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,939
ever shown up in a

63
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,040
actual complaint by the government

64
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,750
against a company before that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

65
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,939
have a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reporting vulnerabilities</font>

66
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,879
to you clearly and so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

67
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,500
and it's part of the complaint<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

68
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,090
kind of a that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting for us</font>

69
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,680
because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

70
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,030
vendors to have good contacts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,220
can report<font color="#CCCCCC"> balls to them and have these</font>

72
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">things get resolved this is the first</font>

73
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,260
time we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen that show open did an</font>

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,730
actual complaint more recently in

75
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,769
January this year many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may be</font>

76
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:42,730
aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> google project zero announced</font>

77
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,989
a vulnerability in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows that</font>

78
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft was planning to patch a couple</font>

79
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:49,700
days later<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they announced it before</font>

80
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:51,919
they were the patch so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google makes the</font>

81
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,078
announcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft post a blog post</font>

82
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that says hey you released a couple days</font>

83
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,459
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed that's kind of not cool</font>

84
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,709
and google updated their policy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> save</font>

85
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,540
all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually give 90 days we're going</font>

86
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give will also give you a 14 day</font>

87
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,929
grace period but we're still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,388
disclose whether or not you have a patch

89
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,609
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the motivations for this talk in part</font>

90
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,680
are because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's been a</font>

91
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,930
research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> resurgence in disclosure</font>

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,459
kerfuffles and that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

93
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,310
word I can I can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with because</font>

94
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,599
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not accurate to say that</font>

95
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,680
it's always the vendors fault is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

96
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,300
accurate to say that it's always the

97
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,620
researchers fault there's lots of

98
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,659
reasons that these things can go wrong

99
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,099
and that's the bulk of my talk here is a

100
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:33,969
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about house one of these things</font>

101
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:35,960
can go wrong but we see we've seen them

102
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,970
we went for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while we're there really</font>

103
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,620
weren't any and then in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year or</font>

104
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,659
two we started to see you know big

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,400
vendors throwing words at other big

106
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:45,169
vendors complaining about how they're

107
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,929
doing vulnerability disclosure we've

108
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,340
seen talks getting taken off the

109
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,419
conference schedule because somebody

110
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,239
wasn't happy with the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going</font>

111
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,760
we've seen threatens of legal legal

112
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,990
intervention we've also observed that

113
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,849
there's a proliferation of novice

114
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,520
vendors there are way more vendors out

115
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:02,630
there today than there used to be

116
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,270
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of small vendors out there</font>

117
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,280
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go from being a</font>

118
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,139
guy who has an idea to a guy who hasn't

119
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened an app store and boom you're a</font>

120
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,810
software vendor and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

121
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font>

122
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,919
about how you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to deal with</font>

123
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:18,270
vulnerabilities in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that coordination</font>

124
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,820
experience hasn't grown at the same rate

125
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,599
we've also seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> also seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

126
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,250
are bolting IP stacks on to everything I

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,750
sure with a room<font color="#CCCCCC"> full of technical folks</font>

128
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,530
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this conference and I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

129
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,850
about what I OT<font color="#E5E5E5"> means but it means that</font>

130
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,710
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can't have an IP stack and</font>

131
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,669
even some things that can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have IP</font>

132
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:42,729
statics at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mary mention</font>

133
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:45,130
anyone can be an app creator we've also

134
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,990
seen that that vol markets and bug

135
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,030
bounties are changing the flow of

136
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">information it used to be you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a vol</font>

137
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,780
you posted it to full disclosure you're

138
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,610
done the vendor has to deal with

139
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,409
whatever that the aftermath is or you

140
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,050
have a vol you report it to cert we tell

141
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,169
the vendor 45 days later we publish to

142
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,470
publish a vol note hopefully the vendor

143
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,479
has patched by then and things go on but

144
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,970
with bug bounties and<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially with</font>

145
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:11,860
third-party bug bounties where you're

a third party who then reports it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's in the in the third</font>

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,400
select them for their security and it's

160
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:48,630
very hard to assess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security of</font>

software libraries that you're including

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,300
obviously there's a rampant growth in

both<font color="#E5E5E5"> awareness of security by the</font>

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,380
itself is bigger there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of folks</font>

172
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,830
of many of the discussions about

173
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,929
vulnerability disclosure although it has

174
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">been pointed out that this predates all</font>

175
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,210
of us there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a there's a quote there</font>

176
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,590
from 1853 about

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and whether or not you talk about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lock-picking recently p tyler from IBM</font>

179
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,008
had a blog post where he mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

180
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,490
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to reconsider our</font>

181
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,870
approach to disclosure because the

182
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,190
system was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just them in the interactions</font>

183
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:46,090
are getting more complicated so one of

184
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,919
the ways that that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about this</font>

185
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,448
and so I work at Sur which is part of

186
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,729
software engineering Institute which is

187
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of Carnegie Mellon University we</font>

188
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,710
think in terms of like math and models

189
00:07:54,099 --> 00:08:00,669
and trying to put some structure around

190
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:03,900
this problem so the reason for creating

191
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,979
models you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know these are operational</font>

192
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,960
operational processes that exists at

193
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:10,120
vendors that exists at and security

194
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,229
companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

195
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,759
convince somebody that they need to

196
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">change the process just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have</font>

197
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,310
an idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be good and might</font>

198
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,840
work so part of part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is we can</font>

199
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,440
have you know we can use models to

200
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,940
describe to talk about the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

201
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,310
see what we can change about the process

202
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,889
without necessarily having to to change

203
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:33,729
the process that's the actual production

204
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:36,250
operations also by building the models

205
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,020
we can't up we can remove some of the

206
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,299
detail of the nitty-gritty of every

207

single<font color="#CCCCCC"> vowel report and talk about</font>

208
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:46,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's how the process works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

209
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,459
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we disagree on the models</font>

210
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have reasons for our disagreement</font>

211
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:52,000
we can create better models that reflect

212
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,540
both how the world works and how it

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,670
should work better so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

previous models that are out there

216
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:05,380
there's a paper from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> larvae Bell</font>

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,740
talking about windows of vulnerability

219
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,300
and this this talks about what happens

220
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,920
before the vulnerabilities disclose and

221
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,930
then once it's disclosed lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

222
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,250
can happen you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a patch you</font>

223
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,319
might get it it might be automated and

224
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,180
turned into malware that vulnerability

225
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,110
might get some publicity and eventually

226
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,779
the last machine that has that

227
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:27,040
vulnerability is either is no longer

228
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:32,110

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,099
a IETF draft put out in 2002 by Steve

231
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,089
which essentially talked about the

232
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,649
vulnerability disclosure process from

233
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:43,459
notification through validation

234
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,170
resolution release and<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-up that's</font>

a linear process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the draft that was called in the title</font>

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,550
it was responsible for mobility

discussion over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years intervening</font>

240
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,399
this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent conversation that I</font>

241
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,889
just happened to catch on Twitter

between the brook and Christmas opal one

243
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:06,860
of the authors of the document it was

244
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,769
basically they<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris acknowledged that</font>

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah responsible might not have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

246
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:15,230
quite the best word largely<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

247
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,029
implies a value<font color="#E5E5E5"> judgment and that turns</font>

248
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,980
it into an argument over competing

249
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,139
perspectives and who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible who's</font>

250
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,300
not responsible who's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

251
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:25,009
thing and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the point</font>

252
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,889
the point is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the vulnerabilities</font>

253
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:29,240
fixed and get the get people get the

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft published it as a as a</font>

coordinate ins coordinated disclosure

264
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,459
doesn't necessarily mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

265
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,529
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the vendor to patch before you</font>

00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:56,689
say anything about it publicly there are

267
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,100
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good reasons that you may need</font>

268
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,829
to talk about vulnerabilities before

269
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,870
there's a patch available in part just

270
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:05,388
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivate that that threat helps to</font>

271
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:10,100
motivate the vendors to to take action

00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:12,439
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> the obi wan caveat applies here</font>

273
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,930
that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we cling to our</font>

depend a lot on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own point of view so</font>

275
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,019
vendors have one perspective security

276
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,819
researchers have another perspective the

277
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,240
government has a protective government

278
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:25,639
actually has multiple perspectives but

279
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,860
our take is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you keep</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in i think the website evaporated</font>

300
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:18,910
there's also been some work on the

301
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,619
academic side about the social value

302
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">social welfare values of disclosing</font>

vulnerabilities and in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> report there</font>

304
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,790
was essentially that acknowledging them

305
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,949
that the vendor is motivated to not

306
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,429
patch as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because they would</font>

307
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:36,889
be unless they're actually internalizing

308
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:38,629
the cost to the user of having to deal

309
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,980
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those vulnerabilities so the more</font>

310
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,139
responsive the vendor is to the user

311
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,759
losses the more aggressive the social

312
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:45,470
planner and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is basically</font>

313
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,089
the quicker you should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

314
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,220
around vulnerabilities because more

315
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,610
responsive vendors that care about users

316
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,459
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> motivated to do that but</font>

322

recently there there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

vulnerability markets and how that's how

325
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sort of shifts the the flow of</font>

vulnerability information between people

327
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,929
paying for vols and people who are doing

00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:32,169
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they still a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linear model</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you turn the knobs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

337
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,639
sure that vulnerabilities gets fixed as

338
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:54,469
opposed to just disappearing on you know

339

341
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,520
from all these models were that you know

and prescriptive advice they all talk

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> linear models that go from start</font>

345
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:11,449
to finish and but even even the earliest

346
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,220
one that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> cited there mentions in the</font>

347

ordering of you fix it it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

350
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,490
into malware and it goes away quietly

351
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,110
some of the later models they start to

352
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,660
incorporate social costs and the motives

353
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,710
of participants and money markets but

354
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,199
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

355
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:34,550
disclosure coordinate disclosure can

356
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:37,340
fail so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to the point where I was</font>

357
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,130
watching a bunch of of vulnerability

court<font color="#E5E5E5"> nations go sideways when you know</font>

359
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,180
in one sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> or another and started to</font>

360
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,370
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this well why why is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

361
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,270
to describe and part of it to me was

362
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,270
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really a concurrency</font>

363
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,500
problem you've got a researcher who has

364
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,750
goals and objectives on the timeline

365
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,010
you've got vendors who have goals and

366
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,170
objectives and something they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

367
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,810
you may also have coordinators involved

368
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,160
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like cert there may be</font>

369
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,599
multiple vendors there may be other

370
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,969
researchers there is there's all sorts

371
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,180
of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can affect these</font>

372
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,980
timelines so you know these the

373
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,890
disclosure process itself is already a

374
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,820
multi-party human-centric process you

375
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,720
know with vendors researchers

376
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,040
coordinators but there's other

377
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,410
stakeholders involved as well like

378
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,000
service providers you know when a major

379
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,530
router vault comes out there are service

380
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,710
providers who have to get things

381
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,270
deployed on a very large scale obviously

382
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,130
governments have had an interest in

383
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,620
vulnerability information for multiple

384
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,700
reasons and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> users and people</font>

385
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,170
who have systems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to</font>

386
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:41,240
protect and each of those parties is

387
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,170
really not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a single party but</font>

388
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a complex</font>

389
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,849
interaction of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people and their</font>

390
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,550
processes policies and procedures so my

391
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,810
model the that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up with is using</font>

392
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">pet free nets and I'll just do a very</font>

393
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:58,010
quick run through of the notation here

394
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,870
so circles are places and the boxes are

395
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,510
a transition so transitions are events

396
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:06,290
that happen think of them as verbs

397
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:07,279
circles are kind of the nouns and places

398
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">can hold tokens</font>

399
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,660
when a when I token is present in the

400
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:15,258
place then the transition is enabled and

401
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,389
then when the transition fires the the

402
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:18,589
token moves so essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you're</font>

403
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">really seeing is you know these tokens</font>

404
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:23,269
just kind of move through the graph as

405
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,888
you go so very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> model of</font>

406
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,749
vulnerability disclosure I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

407
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:30,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the simplest simplest possible one that</font>

408
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:33,860
is even remotely interesting so you've

409
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:35,930
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vol exists and either stuff</font>

410
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,089
happens or other stuff happens and the

411
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,439
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> result is that if stuff happens the</font>

412
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,209
public becomes aware of a vulnerability

413
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:45,139
at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that they become aware</font>

414
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:47,239
of the fix well the other way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

415
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,559
have gone was other stuff happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

416
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,600
now the public becomes aware of a

417
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,370
vulnerability and you've got a zero-day

418
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,230
situation where there's a vulnerability

419
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:59,660
that everyone knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but there's no</font>

420
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:01,040
fix that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so stretching</font>

421
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,640
this out a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit the easiest way to</font>

422
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,619
easy escape the start is with a vendor

423
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,089
and we have a vendor who you know the

424
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,918
vulnerability has to exist before you

425
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,688
can find it and let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

426
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,159
vendor finds the vault so now they're

427
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,130
aware of it but they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to</font>

428
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:17,480
do anything with it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the two big</font>

429
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,010
basic things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have under can do with</font>

430
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,370
a vulnerability or they can write up a

431
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,199
report about it or they can fix it often

432
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:27,559
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to do both in fact we</font>

433
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,789
always want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to do both for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

434
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,649
purposes of discussion here let's just

435
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:32,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that writing a document easier than</font>

00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:35,270
patching the software so they write the

437
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:37,520
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now they not only work on</font>

438
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:41,149
fix both of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> events happened and</font>

439
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,149
now you saw that the publication event

440
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:46,489
transition becomes available and that

441
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:47,600
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they both probably becomes</font>

442
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,610
aware of the fix in the ball at the same

443
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,809
time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just simple you know</font>

444
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,949
vendor find out about evolve they

445
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,139
publish something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they talk</font>

446
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right of document they publish</font>

447
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,960
the fix and the process is<font color="#CCCCCC"> done but</font>

448
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,820
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the option that the vendor</font>

449
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,549
might publish something before they have

450
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,928
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix ready they're aware of active</font>

451
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:07,600
exploitation or lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons that</font>

452
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:11,750
they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to announce something</font>

453
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,158
before they're totally ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so I</font>

454
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,669
fixed that in the next version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

455
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,360
model and this version also adds a

456
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:21,350
researcher<font color="#E5E5E5"> in addition to the vendor</font>

457
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,929
so now we've got some more interesting

458
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,189
interactions that can happen so in this

459
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,660
case since we've already talked about

460
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,460
the vendor flow we'll just we'll start

461
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,350
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> researcher might</font>

462
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,540
find a vulnerability and they decide

463
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:35,090
they're going to start writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up in</font>

464
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,610
the flow through this model their option

465
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,560
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish but now</font>

466
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,939
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to publish it as full</font>

467
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,690
disclosure there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to drop drops</font>

468
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,400
your day<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the vendor so they do now</font>

469
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,630
public's aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the vulnerability the</font>

470
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,650
vendors also aware the vulnerability

471
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,420
because hopefully they're reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

472
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,940
security mailing list but now they've

473
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,170
got it'll do all this catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> up work and</font>

474
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,620
so they write the fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> they create the</font>

475
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,210
fix and they publish it and hopefully

476
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,439
the public becomes aware a<font color="#E5E5E5"> second time</font>

477
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the vulnerability but now there's a</font>

478
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,590
fixed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but we can also rewind that</font>

479
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,390
decision to<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the research or</font>

480
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,360
just publishing it they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide to</font>

481
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,380
notify the vendor and now we can

482
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,270
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this as a concurrent</font>

483
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,920
process we've got we've got tokens in

484
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,620
motion across the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

485
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,050
researcher end and the vendor in and if

486
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,120
they all agree to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait sorry if they all</font>

487
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,860
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait then we're good but</font>

488
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,939
there's also the option here that the

489
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,080
researcher might still go full

490
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,780
disclosure even though they reported to

491
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,600
the vendor well why would that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

492
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,570
one example in the last month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two was</font>

493
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,350
there was a there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Minecraft vol</font>

494
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:42,980
that wasn't was announced and it was

495
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:45,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">only at that point did did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mojang slush</font>

496
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft he now owns them did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

497
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,620
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we actually hadn't fixed</font>

498
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,970
that so it was the publication of the

499
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,320
vulnerability report that brought it to

500
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,670
their attention that they thought they

501
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,520
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed something and it turned out</font>

502
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,650
they hadn't the researcher in this case

503
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,520
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notes that in his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comments that</font>

504
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,930
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a combination of</font>

505
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,700
miscommunication and a lack of testing

506
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:04,550
the leads of the situation and hopefully

507
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,780
it can be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning experience so</font>

508
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,800
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've fulfilled that since</font>

509
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,730
you're here you're listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me talk</font>

510
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so hopefully learn something so</font>

511
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">going back to the before the full</font>

512
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,780
disclosure happens if the research are

513
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,430
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting the vendor gets ready and</font>

514
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,649
now we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

515
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,480
this can go the researcher can can

516
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,100
publish at first the vendor can publish

517
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,750
independently or they can all go at the

518
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,370
same time which<font color="#CCCCCC"> has traditionally been</font>

519
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's referred to as responsible</font>

520
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,550
disclosure

521
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,379
coordinating disclosure but again the

522
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,570
end result here is public becomes aware

523
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendor become part of the fix and the</font>

524
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,510
ball at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this</font>

525
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,020
is becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> increasingly complex a chart</font>

526
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:49,020
here this one has a researcher<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vendor</font>

527
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,240
but it also has a coordinator and this

528
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,100
comes into play when the researcher

529
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,600
might find a vulnerability but they

530
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,189
don't know who to talk to a defender the

531
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,959
situation we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about with Fandango</font>

532
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,620
I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to the top who I should</font>

533
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this to they may contact a</font>

534
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:07,830
coordinator like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sir or a bug Bonnie and</font>

535
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,770
the coordinator then contacts the vendor

536
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,030
and now we've got the researcher doing

537
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,430
their thing the coordinator is doing

538
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,010
their thing they're all preparing

539
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:19,040
documentation to publish and the vendor

540
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,180
has to do their thing create a patch and

541
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,620
the main point of this whole chart is

542
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,790
just look how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many green boxes there are</font>

543
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,080
those are all things that could happen

544
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,610
so even at this point where everyone is

545
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,770
actually collaborating and coordinated

546
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,729
on this it can still go wrong a lot of

547
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,590
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's only really one</font>

548
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,170
transition here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it work so</font>

549
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,510
that the vendor is the vault comes out

550
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:45,780
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patch when that</font>

551
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:46,950
happens everything's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

552
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,370
what it looks like when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to add</font>

553
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,840
in things like a miscreant you know bad

554
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,479
guy who may find out about the ball and

555
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,120
do something to you as well also<font color="#CCCCCC"> i added</font>

556
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">cv and NBD here not not because they're</font>

557
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end-all of all these processes but</font>

558
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,410
just to highlight the fact that entries

559
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,330
in in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE database and cvd</font>

560
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,910
dictionary and the NBD database don't

561
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,260
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> until all of this process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

562
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,980
already gone on so there's there's a

563
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:17,250
there's a lot of complexity upstream of

564
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:20,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">CVEs and the other point is that this is</font>

565
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">still just a single vendor vulnerability</font>

566
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,960
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say well what</font>

567
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,270
happens if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a second vendor and</font>

568
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,440
I got about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that far with it and gave up</font>

569
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,320
because there are limits to use in

570
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Petrine us to model the</font>

571
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff mainly as you've probably</font>

572
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,220
guessed from sitting there watching

573
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,269
these charts get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated it's</font>

574
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to present it in a way</font>

575
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:45,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's understandable once you get so</font>

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:49,840
from a modeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> standpoint the</font>

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">state-space grows very quickly as it's</font>

579
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,559
tough to actually work through it and

580
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,299
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> petrina</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't they're not very good for</font>

583
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:03,908
modeling the history of events as they

584
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,110
occurred so there are things that would

585
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen differently in the disclosure</font>

586
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,709
process depending on which path you

587
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,750
could follow to get there this really

588
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">just talks about how you know how you</font>

589
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,649
maintain synchronization across across

590
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,720
them but the it doesn't doesn't really

591
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:19,539
account for the history of who moved

592
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,009
first in which image situations so one

593
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,710
of the things we're we're looking into

594
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:25,840
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is whether agent-based models could</font>

595
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:30,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">work better for example with a state</font>

596
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,750
machine like this where each each player

597
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:34,449
essentially starts out unaware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

598
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,309
vulnerability they learn about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

599
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,289
now they're you know they're actively

600
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:40,450
working on it they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font>

601
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,549
somebody outside a question so they go

602
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,649
into a wait state eventually the answer

603
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:46,720
comes back and they resume work or they

604
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,979
might also be waiting for so<font color="#CCCCCC"> long that</font>

605
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">they just get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bored and move on to other</font>

606
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,500
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> or their priorities may shift</font>

607
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:56,019
they move on to two other other things

608
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,179
and they become disengaged either way

609
00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually either you publish you stop</font>

610
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:05,370
work on it or you abandon the whole

611
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:07,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">process excuse me the cool thing about</font>

612
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,090
that sort of model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it lets you</font>

613
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:12,668
start to build more complex models than

614
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,709
you know without<font color="#E5E5E5"> having all of that that</font>

615
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:17,019
interaction complexity that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

616
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,549
detriment model we can we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font>

617
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,389
talk about vendors researchers and

618
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,519
coordinators and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

619
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:27,758
multiple parties being involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

620
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:30,250
and even adding adding more more more

621
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,779
stakeholders to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process and they may</font>

622
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">have different actions that they take in</font>

623
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:40,619
different processes that you could model

624
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:44,340
over there those things so a lot of this

625
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:46,168
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just helping to describe to you guys</font>

626
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,178
and also part of part of the motivation

627
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:49,289
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us doing this was we had some new</font>

628
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,549
guys coming on board that we're starting

629
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in volatility</font>

630
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:55,139
coordination and we wanted to explain to

631
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,369
them you know here's here's how complex

632
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:57,600
this thing is and all the pieces you

633
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to know understand that fit</font>

634
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,610
together but some of the things that

635
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:05,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've learned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's search from doing</font>

636
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,019
this for for a long time it's really

637
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,220
that you know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

638
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,299
break in there things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work so let</font>

639
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,799
me talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font>

640
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:16,200
the break the process first up is that

641
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">normally coordinated disclosure is a</font>

642
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,779
human oriented process this is not about

643
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,939
the data as much as it is about people

644
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:25,889
noticing things people telling other

645
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,230
people about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and expecting them</font>

646
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:33,178
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about it so you kind of</font>

647
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,279
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor in all of all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

648
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,570
psychology stuff you can in that you

649
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,659
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have different knowledge</font>

650
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,460
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have different motives everybody</font>

651
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,679
has limited attention they've got

652
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,110
emotions they can get angry they can be

653
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,659
happy they've got biases they notice

654
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,149
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they ignore others</font>

655
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:52,950
they may or may not perceive perceive

656
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,850
things that that are in a car<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there</font>

657
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,559
and importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have expectations</font>

658
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,850
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those those factors affects</font>

659
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,379
the decisions and actions that the

660
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,629
players make in these sorts of

661
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:05,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">disclosure process and because you've</font>

662
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:07,049
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple parties doing it that's</font>

663
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,210
kind of the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the complexity of</font>

664
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:14,429
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and really when you</font>

665
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,960
when you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as the background and</font>

666
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:19,289
look at well how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can things actually</font>

667
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,809
fall apart first up is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the researcher</font>

668
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the vendor may not be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find each</font>

669
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,918
other and the channel may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not get</font>

670
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,990
established so if the vendor doesn't

671
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,149
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a have a contact for where do you</font>

672
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:33,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">report vulnerabilities that's the first</font>

673
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:35,518
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that falls apart if the contact</font>

674
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:37,168
isn't if you can find a contact but

675
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,519
they're non-responsive it might be that

676
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,749
they're not the right contact it might

677
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,289
be that there's no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching the</font>

678
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:44,909
inbox it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they just don't</font>

679
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,140
care yeah there's there's lots of

680
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons why the contact</font>

681
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,550
wonder if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm tech might not be</font>

682
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:54,150
responsive that can stop things from

683
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:56,399
from moving on as well we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

684
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,070
more companies that have have Twitter

685
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,540
accounts if they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a good</font>

security contact that's findable via

687
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:06,120
google like if you search for reporter

688
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,560
vulnerability to company name chances

689
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,580
are your<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter account is going to get</font>

690
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:15,000
some vol reports one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> or another and</font>

691
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,830
most most<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter accounts are run by</font>

692
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,350
marketers who have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what that</font>

693
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,850
process looks like or where they should

694
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,129
report it to and they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tech</font>

695
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,389
support problem is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not or</font>

696
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,510
the contact might be your tech support

697
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,280
in which case if your tech support is

698
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,590
asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customer account number</font>

699
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,030
before they will talk to you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

reporting the vowel doesn't have an

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,180
account they may not have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sock they</font>

and it tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the right thing but</font>

706
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,370
you're putting barricades in their way

707
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point they say screw it I'm</font>

708
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:50,219
done I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just drop this drop a</font>

709
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:53,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero day at a conference so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

710
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,660
vendor contact useful thing the other

711
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,470
thing we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen is that the receiver</font>

712
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:00,240
can saturate meaning that there they

713
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,650
just out of bandwidth to deal with the

714
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of reports they've got coming</font>

715
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,220
in maybe it's there's one guy and he's

716
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">only got half a day a week to deal with</font>

717
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,670
this maybe it's that there's a team but

718
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">they just got a whole bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

719
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,200
dropped on them maybe it's black hat

<font color="#CCCCCC">DEFCON season and everybody's aiming all</font>

721
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,220
of their guns at one vendor that happens

722
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:22,950
you know sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just it's just</font>

723
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:27,570
the human process or the cognitive load

724
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:29,550
the comfort I mean there's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

725
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,020
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many tickets in at once you know it</font>

726
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,490
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be that you're not doing a</font>

727
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,720
very good job as triage and so there's

728
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,820
there's lots of reasons that that can

729
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,320
that can fall apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the vendor side</font>

730
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,629
it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> could fall apart on the</font>

731
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:44,700
researcher side so researcher reports a

732
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:46,380
bug to a vendor the vendor responds with

733
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,430
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and the research we've moved</font>

734
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,890
on to something else and now they're

735
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,820
busy and they don't respond so that can

736
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen on that side as well</font>

with the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> minecraft example</font>

739
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,408
synchronization can be lost where you

740
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,240
think you're in state a where it's fixed

741
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:06,299
and the researcher knows that you're in

742
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,059
state B with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not fixed you can have</font>

743
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:11,070
mismatch fact mismatched expectations as

744
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:13,770
things as simple as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

745
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">release this report at 8am that's not</font>

746
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,470
specific enough unless you're both in

the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone and you both know</font>

last week we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a report that we were</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">expecting the publish at 8am and it</font>

751
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,179
turns out they published it overnight

752
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,860
because we failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notice that the</font>

753
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:31,140
reporter<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in Germany and the vendors</font>

754
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,139
in on the west coast we're in the

755
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:38,490
eastern time zone so you know nobody

756
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:40,200
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed on what 8am meant we've</font>

757
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,820
also seen situations where the channel

758
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,169
breaks down because one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

759
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,629
other goes not responsive like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

760
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:48,950
there's there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of reasons</font>

761
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:53,279
just from the human process failures or

762
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:55,830
time attention requirements that that

763
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,460
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen it may also happen</font>

764
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:01,350
because one side goes hostile you know

765
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,789
you want to quash the vulnerability

766
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,110

770
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:17,700
those sorts of things that in the end

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,240
reports are not one off games it's a

what they say is is that the you know

winning strategies tend to look like

791

they're nice and forgiving but they're

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,960
be the best policy to just drop it on

861
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:51,490
everybody all at once because if you

862
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,759
tell some people but not others there's

863
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,259
there's jealousy and anger and people

864
00:33:54,759 --> 00:34:00,159
get upset because why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:07,299
make the point that maintaining vendor

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,900
with one vol that we've seen is recent

automatically harvest this frustrated

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,650
publish it in this case we decided not

929
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,660
to not to do that because the attacker

930
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,700
doesn't get to pick which apps you're

931

we were already aware of

man-in-the-middle attacks occurring so

935
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,220
we decided we were going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,930
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an active exploitation policy</font>

00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,510
they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give them give them</font>

records in in an automated way in that

945
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,450
short period of time so we used a Google

spreadsheet for that other things that

947
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:20,430
break well y'all heard of CDE 10k did

948
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,710
you all realize that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE had to add</font>

949
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,970
extra extra digits of the date they

950
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,770
could continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to count vulnerabilities</font>

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,310

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first two thousand</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CVE it's the same vulnerability so if</font>

here is that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE counts</font>

969
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:12,120

count lots of things and they're they're

1023
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,440
quickly just because researchers get

antsy if they haven't heard back from

find a vendor contact or they're not

responsive ask for help clear concise

1053

reports are always good and appreciated

1054

by everybody involved and if you have

constraints like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference</font>

publication date or something like say

<font color="#E5E5E5">so and finally just just to avoid that</font>

00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,868
that minecraft incident you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know give</font>

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,308
the vendor of final warning because a

00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:33,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">single email would have solved that and</font>

1061
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:35,010
said hey I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish this and</font>

1062
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:36,900
they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have noticed oh we didn't</font>

1063
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:41,790
actually fix it yet and they can they

1064
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,349
can react accordingly corollary to that

1065
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,150
don't assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors ignoring</font>

1066
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:46,140
you if it's intentional there's lots of

1067
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons that can happen</font>

1068
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,450
eff has some good information about

1069
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,920
about rights for researchers again

1070
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:59,700
having a cooperation<font color="#CCCCCC"> bias is a good</font>

1071
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:02,099
thing so to wrap this up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

1072
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:05,669
observation it's part of this goes back

1073
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:07,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the cve 10k problem in the 24,000</font>

1074
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:12,839
walls that we did we found in android

1075
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,399
but there are average stats that come

1076
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,808
out like vulnerabilities report

1077
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,309
vulnerability reports per year and

1078
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:21,599
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> these in every all of the</font>

1079
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,430
threat intelligence reports that cannot

1080
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,230
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were forty 712</font>

1081
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,549
vulnerabilities last year whatever the

1082
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,660
number is and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number has been</font>

1083
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing and they'll show a graph that</font>

1084
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:34,200
shows it growing the point is they're

1085
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,579
all under counting and it's much it's

1086
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,308
worse than it appears I mean even as

1087
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:42,390
steep as that curve looks it gets worse

1088
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:44,039
so I you know it may look like the

1089
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,019
effort involved in and the other thing

1090
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,339
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the average the average number</font>

1091
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:49,259
of messages per vol like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1092
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:51,420
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> four for us we just is a quick</font>

1093
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">acknowledgment get it done get out the</font>

1094
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:58,160
door but some balls are very very large

1095
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:00,598
and require a lot of coordination so if

1096
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,578
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> building storm sewers to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font>

1097
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,130
the average daily rainfall you get

1098
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,799
floods because that's not how storms

1099
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,599
work storms come along both the average

1100
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:11,880
rainfall on a day is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low most</font>

1101
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,920
places don't rain most of time but some

1102
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,619
days you get hurricanes and some days

1103
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,440
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad hurricanes and so if</font>

1104
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,329
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> build for the average rainfall</font>

building<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong capacity and that</font>

1107
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:26,099
applies to handling you know

1108
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,990
coordinating vulnerabilities that

1109
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:31,559
applies to dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reports</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1110
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">they come in at a vendor for that matter</font>

1111
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:36,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that even deals with the the incident or</font>

1112
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,119
the dealing with patches as you're

1113
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,289
trying to deploy packages you have to

1114
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,720
have enough capacity to deal with the

1115
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:45,000
worst flood you can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a given</font>

1116
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,868
time frame and sometimes you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1117
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,490
be wrong a second major point there's no

1118
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:53,880
there is no one-size-fits-all disclosure

1119
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:54,839
policy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've got we've dealt</font>

1120
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,549
with traditional shrink wrap software

1121
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:59,790
for a long time in traditional computing

1122
00:43:56,549 --> 00:44:02,960
but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enterprise customization</font>

1123
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:05,640
there's continuous deployment of

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,800
services and<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems you get mobile apps</font>

1125
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,660
and app stores cloud services whether

constraints on how disclosure probably

1130
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,819
should happen some of them are easy to

1131
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,900
fix you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put a fix in your</font>

automatically test it and it rolls out

1134
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:27,210
within minutes or you might have an

1135
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,379
embedded device you gotta put somebody

1136

on a helicopter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fly them up into</font>

up any questions

1181

who and not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to name specifics but</font>

1190
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,660
we have spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vendors who originally</font>

1191
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,368
set up a bug bounty that they were

paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bounty on their released</font>

1193
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:27,519
software and once the software do is

1194
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:29,349
gold it releases and the development

1195
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,868
team disbands because now you're in

1196
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:33,869
maintenance mode and so if your bug

1197
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:36,609
bounty only applies to really software

1198
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:38,289
as soon as you release and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your the</font>

00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:43,170
moving on to other projects or whatever

1201
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:45,430
you wind up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this flurry of</font>

1202
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,559
vulnerability reports coming in and the

1203
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:51,368
people who could fix them are gone right

1204
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:53,890
so the the ideal here is and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

1205
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:56,170
this with I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I eat the IE bug</font>

00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:58,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">bounty a while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back did this where they</font>

1207
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,920
set the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonny as during the beta period</font>

1209

the appliance and once it goes once it

1210
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,079
releases it doesn't so they're trying to

1211
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:08,079
you know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want you to do</font>

1212
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:10,210
is go download the data find all the

1213
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,460
vowels and hold them until it goes until

1214
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">it goes master or gold whatever they</font>

1215
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,450
call way we call it you don't you don't

1216
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,710
want that to happen because then all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1217
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:21,069
vols come in after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> teens gone</font>

1218
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:22,269
there's lots of vendors that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1219
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:24,549
kind of recognized this and they're

1220
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:26,169
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push they'll do the bug</font>

1221
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:27,430
bounty during a beta period or during

1222
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,019
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the period when you've got the</font>

1223
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,299

1224
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:33,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">who can handle the reports that team you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know that it grows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in size over a period</font>

1226

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and then it starts to drop right</font>

1227
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,730
before release well you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to line up</font>

1228
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,539
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug bounty so that the reports are</font>

1229
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,890
coming in at the

1230
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:43,959
where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most capacity to deal</font>

00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:47,308
with them<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's probably</font>

1232
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:47,308
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we've got four</font>

1233
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,160
there

1234
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:13,929
I know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

1235
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:17,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's yeah I don't have any I don't have</font>

1236
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:19,509
any direct direct example i can think of

1237
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,099
cases where it's it's notably better<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1238
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:23,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">think just the fact that it's usually</font>

1239
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:25,979
open discussions with multiple parties

1240
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:29,489
not all of whom serves the same masters

1241
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:31,689
tends to make it a little more honest

1242
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:35,229
there's less you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hide in an open</font>

1243
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:38,828
source project so if somebody reports of

1244
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:39,910
vulnerability you know it's fairly it's

1245
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:41,049
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fairly clearly defined</font>

1246
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,118
whether or not it actually the vault

1247
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:46,869
actually exists and when it gets fixed

1248
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,640
it's gonna be hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to squash that we've</font>

1249
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:50,919
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> closed-source vendors who will say</font>

1250
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,299
we fix the following<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDEs and they</font>

1251
00:49:50,919 --> 00:49:55,660
provide no information about what those

1252
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:58,538
CVEs are so it's easier for closed

1253
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,729
source to kind of not really hide but

1254
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:03,009
obfuscate what they fixed and how they

1255
00:50:00,729 --> 00:50:04,689
fixed it open source obviously has more

1256
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:07,839
of a public track record that's that's

1257
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:09,249
explorable that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the major</font>

1258
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,699
difference i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can think of off the</font>

1259
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:11,698
top of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> head</font>

1260
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:18,670
okay thank you very much
