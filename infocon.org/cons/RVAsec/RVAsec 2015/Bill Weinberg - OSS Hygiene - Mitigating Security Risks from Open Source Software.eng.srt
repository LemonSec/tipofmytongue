at Black Duck software black duck is

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,270
pretty new to the security arena if

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,340
you've been around open source

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,620
especially in the areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of governance</font>

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,629
and compliance you will have tripped

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,610
over black duck during the last decade

00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:42,430

I come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> black</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> duck from an acquisition</font>

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,039
around three years we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

20
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,699
about what we're calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source</font>

21
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:12,580
hygiene today which is mitigating risks

00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,530
by cross-referencing<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,200
scanning which is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Black Duck</font>

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,210
specialty is that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Black Duck</font>

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,819
offers as a tool and does as a service

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:26,818
by cross-referencing those technologies

27
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:26,819
with vulnerability databases

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,470
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the abstract for when we</font>

been a lot of call it negative press

lately about open source and

59
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,609
vulnerabilities kind of show the reality

60
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,220
debunk some of the hype talk about how

61
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,260
all this is relating back to the open

of that model and then outline what we

mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by open source hygiene so first of</font>

65
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,720
all open source is doing very very well

66
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,630
so well that it's completely ubiquitous

67

<font color="#CCCCCC">even with that consideration it's very</font>

92

high and other respondents and we had

94
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,540
only took complete answers so this is

00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,549
based on a cohort of 1,200 respondents

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,130
while i was at open source web and labs

100
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,140
we considered ourselves defenders of the

101
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,380
faith we were worried about open source

102
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,969
surviving against the onslaught<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

Linux and opening portions of net and

everywhere across the industry open

109
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,130
source is there it's no longer a novelty

110
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,239
it's completely mainstream it's not used

111
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:01,670
everywhere but it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> close just if</font>

112
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,070
you look at our particular survey since

113
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:07,580
2010 that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

114
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the figure for people using open source</font>

115
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,140
or admitting to using it has basically

116
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,489
doubled and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> funny thing about these</font>

117
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,680
numbers is they're actually very

118
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,780
conservative one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

119
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,190
black duck does is we go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

120
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,320
and on request or as a matter of our

121
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,960
regular business relationship we scan

122
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,790
their software portfolios for open

123
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,719
source and for the licenses and for

124
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:35,780
other information and almost invariably

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,780
companies are under estimating their use

126
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,679
of open source we find are the companies

127
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">that of course call us up you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 93%</font>

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,620
extensively it's not at all an unusual

130
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:54,740
is the way we work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we collect</font>

131
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,880

growing which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good news bad news</font>

144
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,820
dichotomy because having open source

145
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,530
everywhere is healthy it gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> people a</font>

potential for a lot of vulnerabilities

149
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,780
open source goes across every single

150
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,000
industry every so often I'll find a

151
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,469
pocket where it simply doesn't play like

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,539
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a legacy migration project</font>

last year for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large aerospace for them</font>

154
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:01,250
and they identified four silos that they

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,830
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to look at one of which was</font>

156
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,810
semiconductor design and there's really

157
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,090
not a lot of open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> and selling</font>

the money is where the excitement is a

how end users of open source and IT

182
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,310
people at large regard the security of

183
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,320
open source so first of all if we're

184
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,630
finding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty-six percent of</font>

respondents look first to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

186
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:19,990
and think that open source is the place

to go for security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is kind of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregation of two concepts one that</font>

it's certainly an impressive number and

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,060
it belies what I've heard in my

205
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,180
it's considered very secure but maybe

206
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's actually occluding some issues</font>

207
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,569
and confusing people about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

them blindly or hold their nose but in

analysis game are worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it maybe</font>

233
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,230
they're making a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much noise I</font>

through 2020 now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because open</font>

growing very fast last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year was a banner</font>

245
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,530
year and this year's already gotten off

246
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,030
to a quick start and what everyone seems

247
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,459
to be remembering at least in our neck

248
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,810
of the woods are the open-source

249
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,020
vulnerabilities that were part of this

250
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,339
very large set of detected and publish

252
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,590
into the set that never got CVEs

253
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:57,020
attached so the kinds of vulnerabilities

254
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:00,440
that we worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that we address are</font>

255
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,650
the ones like heartbleed and shell shock

256
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,320
and poodle freak ghost venom the list

257
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes on and on it's kind of become a fad</font>

258
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,730
and the media to give these

259
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,350
vulnerabilities cute names or to take

260
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,650
the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> different developers give them</font>

thousand depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose database you</font>

267

268
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,770
an open source which is better than

269
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
sixty percent but it's still a

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,680
significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and a number that</font>

271
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,770
needs to be managed

272
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,989
and the thing about open source is not

273
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">only has it been a high pitch in terms</font>

of naming vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

275
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,990
projects tend to be linked to one

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,730
another very closely there's a lot of

projects some are worse than others so

279
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,920
when a vulnerability arises in something

280
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,660
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl in fact there's thirty or</font>

thirty four vulnerabilities currently

287
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,760
and infrastructure because open source

now for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> working in open source</font>

301
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,000
the good news is that in general

regulated industries and government

303
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,040
agencies are now very friendly to open

and it doesn't stand alone not only you

have to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> updateable in theory</font>

352
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,930
you have to build a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mechanism and</font>

network to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> updateable a</font>

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,069
practice now you're probably familiar

with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> phones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting updates and</font>

maybe some of your other home

electronics giving you the options for

358
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,060
updates but this is a more rigorous

359
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,930
requirement than what you typically see

in the industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font>

361
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,090
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source</font>

00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">development model for a moment and</font>

363
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,920
understand why open source is or isn't

364
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,810
more secure because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Mythology I wouldn't say miss</font>

366
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,520
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's say optimism and</font>

367
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,830
exaggeration about the upside of

<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source at least where I come from</font>

369
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,930
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live in the open source bubble</font>

370
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,660
and conversely outside of that bubble

371
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,709
there's a lot of let's say

372
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,069
misunderstanding and pessimism about

373
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:34,460
that same model so is it inherently more

374
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:37,070
or less secure well the basis of the

375
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,930
open source quality model development

376
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,710
model ultimately security model is

377
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,849
what's usually called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lina slaw and</font>

Lina's law actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't uttered by</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">technology and community layers and it's</font>

393
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,130
important to tease<font color="#CCCCCC"> apart these layers to</font>

394
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,900
understand the development model and to

understand the implications for security

396
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,730
so everything starts with code and

397
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,350
around the code or the core developers

398
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,140

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,550
reporting bugs all the different

441
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,440
outcomes of actually using software

together with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development community</font>

445
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,379
create new versions that have fixed the

00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,270
bugs that have added patches that have

447
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,800
added new features over time and of

448
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,020
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like any other engineering</font>

organization the project leads have a

450
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,690
distinct tension between fixing bugs and

451
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,910
adding features and so the good news is

452
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic mantra of open source</font>

453
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,230
is released early release often and so

454
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,970
open source moves along at a much more

455
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,100
rapid pace with incremental releases

456
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,800
sometimes their experimental sometimes

457
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,290
their main line and it has resulted in a

458
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,990
very rapid evolution of open source and

459
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,560
presumably a rapid advancement in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">quality and security of the software to</font>

incremental improvement so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at</font>

462
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,390
the many eyes aspect of this the

463
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,120
community is watching the code primarily

464
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:14,020
it's watching the code for basic code

465
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:16,300
quality code style it used to be funny

466
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,960
when I was a Monta Vista our customers

467
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,280
used to ask oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god do I have to hand</font>

468
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,080
that back to the community do I have to

469
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,010
publish that do i do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to submit</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

471
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,879
and the basic answer if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending</font>

here's the license and depends on the

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,730
the code but under under my breath I was

478
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,530
thinking you should be so lucky most

479
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,090
patches most feature requests are

480
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,560
completely ignored in the communities

481
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,959
around the project's move on at their

482
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,780
own pace most people's feature requests

483
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,720
don't make it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main line it has</font>

484
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,700
to be a logical change it has to be a

485
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,700
reasonable patch it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be well</font>

486
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,680
structured and<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-documented and even</font>

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,780
when I was working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for companies who are</font>

at the doing real solid work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

490
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,670
maintainer is especially if the Linux

491
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,080
kernel would take our patches and

492
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,360
totally refactor them to the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

493
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,770
we were even<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to recognize them we</font>

494
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,379

495
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,940
the country contributors files so this

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,130
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it's all supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work and in</font>

497
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,340
many cases this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works with</font>

498
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,570
emphasis on code quality code style

499
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,060
which varies a bit from project to

500
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,850
project certainly there's also another

501
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,800
defense mechanism against errant code

502
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,860
that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

503
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,930
and I affectionately call it the triple

504
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,090
fence in memory of what the NSA used to

505
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,760
sing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself but the fences are a</font>

506
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,550
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> different with open source the first</font>

507
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,640
fence is that of the people running the

508
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,500
project did they let in funky code do

509
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,320
they accept patches that shouldn't be

510
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,320
there do they accept sub optimal code

511
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,350
badly written code and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first</font>

512
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,379
layer comes from how mature the project

513
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,780
is how the maintainer<font color="#CCCCCC"> zar what their</font>

514
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,810
focus is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are there</font>

515
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,040
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so that's where the</font>

516
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,350
primary defense comes from and that's

517
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,629
what determines the character of a

518
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:17,110
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at black duck we</font>

519
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,450
have a free public tool called a open

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,250
hub that<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to be called olo if you</font>

the name of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your favorite open source</font>

524
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,660
project and you'll learn a lot about who

525
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,910
the developers are how often they're

526
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,890
releasing when patches were released how

527
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,750
many been released over time it's a very

528
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,290
useful research tool and certainly

529
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,180
useful for assessing the maturity and

530
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,750
indirectly the security of an open

531
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:45,000
source project the second fence has to

532
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,550
do with aggregating other projects into

533
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,330
a platform or distribution so whether

534

are doing and in fact it's their job to

554
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,190
productize open source and so they're

555
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,990
running things like regression tests and

556
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,370

putting it together into a functional

569
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,220
grouping and again you're doing tests

570
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,260
and exercising the code in ways that are

571
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,000
unique to that particular task to

572

well now

the challenge is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that while many eyes do</font>

582
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,950
most projects are there about getting

high functionality out to market quickly

584

we chose the term hygiene because we're

on the center here it's a cross section

<font color="#CCCCCC">of code quality of update and patch</font>

so both Gardner and Forrester have

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes so what what really goes on here</font>

is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> either by using tools that we</font>

sufficiently comprehensive for the

00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,550
purposes of really doing open source I

695
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,530
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to consult for a company</font>

their little tools I was just a

00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,240
consulting services company they would

700
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,830
burp out a bill of material for every

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,570
all of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> builds but it was sort of a</font>

702
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">top level it wasn't very comprehensive</font>

703
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's what a lot of other tools</font>

00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">will get you whatever level though</font>

705
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,129
mature you get at the very least you

706
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to know the name of the component</font>

707

and you want to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

708
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,520
determine diversion to make all of this

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,840
work because what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing well</font>

710
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,389
you're basing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the assumption</font>

that newer is more secure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> newer is</font>

will be vulnerabilities and even

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,340
complement each other very nicely and

727
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,700
we're also working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our friends at</font>

vulnerabilities logged against different

732
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,780
versions of the software we do very

00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,730
comprehensive scans to figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

734
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,680
version but for us the original

735
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,780
motivation for caring about versions is

736
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,970
that an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source from version to</font>

737
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,560
version the licensing terms can change

738
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,320
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our customers originally</font>

739
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,169

<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of information</font>

interesting as to where they're open

763
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,250

governance either which has been across

that we born for a while but at the most

773
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,500
basic level if you're using scanning

774
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,030
tools like ones we provide or the ones

775
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,350
that anyone provides you can get stuff

776

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out of get for that matter</font>

777
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:03,719
you're going to be scanning the the repo

778
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,300
for the actual components that make up

779
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,280
your project make up your build and it

780
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,139
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a very thorough scan and</font>

781
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,670
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on how the</font>

782
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,380

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,640
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to retrieve version information</font>

784
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:19,140
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important that you do</font>

785
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,020
certainly you can be triggering this

786
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,490
automatically doing it in the repo is

787
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,490
usually something you do on demand as

788
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,230
part of an audit exercise doing it as

789
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,929
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your build is the best way to do</font>

790
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:33,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">it because processes like this only work</font>

791
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:35,070
if you don't disrupt existing workflow

792
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,480
so it's best to build them in to

793
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:41,450
whatever processes you already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

794
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,450
place and in fact what we're doing oops

795
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:49,190
what we're doing is we're actually going

796

to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> offering a plug-in as free</font>

805
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:19,330
their severity is now the our goal is

806
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,610
not to supplant security testing we know

807
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:25,010
that opens<font color="#E5E5E5"> reside gene is a relatively</font>

it applies to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source code it</font>

810
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,650
doesn't really help you with your whole

811
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:34,070
portfolio but open source is often the

812
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,830
big black box in people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw overall</font>

organization their technology portfolio

814
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:41,090
so the difference from our point of view

815
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:43,130
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're doing and what a</font>

range<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traditional security testing</font>

817
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,179
does is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to integrate</font>

this further and further back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

819
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:52,130
application lifecycle and so all the way

820
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,899
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the analysis stage we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

821
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,900
working with people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build governance</font>

822
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,400
strategy and governance policy and so is

823
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">very logical that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd be building</font>

824
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,020
their security policies in at the very

825
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:05,540
same time similarly at the design phase

826
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,090
they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be consciously selecting</font>

827

their open source based on governance

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,020
and licensing issues but at the same

829
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,570
time on security considerations and so

830
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,549
on down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line we're very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

831
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,139
convinced that this process will not

832
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:20,299
work unless it's thoroughly integrated

833
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,470
into the development lifecycle whichever

834
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:26,600
particular methodology you are using now

835
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:29,720
it's not easy it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

836
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,549
simple association between a component

837
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,950
and vulnerability is in which database

838
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:35,389
you look in and which one you choose but

839
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,600
there's a lot of technical and social

840
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:40,400
barriers to making it work so on the

841
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,110
technical side simply the schemas in the

842
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,120
databases are not consistent they're not

843
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,520
immediately possible they don't always

844
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,800
map cleanly back version information can

845
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,950
be obfuscated<font color="#CCCCCC"> adan the building material</font>

846
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,280
side and on the database side if you

847
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,380
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> build it into the work</font>

848
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">close it's harder to use and people</font>

849
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't use it a big challenge is the scan</font>

850
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:03,270
speed so if you're not doing continuous

851
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,770
integration and making the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption</font>

852
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're only scanning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta's if you're</font>

853
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:09,750
scanning the entire corpus it can be

854
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,520
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenging in quite slow and so</font>

855
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,560
you need to have tools that move fast

856
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,020
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this worthwhile and we're</font>

857
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,668
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in some cases code bases</font>

858
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,690
that have 40 million lines of code in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

859
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:23,819
so it's a non-trivial operation DevOps

860
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,320
you can be a little easier the issue of

861
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,929
course is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many builds you're doing a</font>

862
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,530
day how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> builds you're doing an hour</font>

863
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,510
how many bills you're doing

864
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,340
simultaneously in an organization and

865
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,290
certainly being able to scan

866
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,419
comprehensively as a real problem I mean

867
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,759
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code there may be</font>

868
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,379
multiple repo location so you may not

869
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,550
even know where all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your repositories</font>

870
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:48,630
are having proper language support our

871

878
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,020
very shortly to address for example our

881
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:17,820

governance processes that open source

doesn't just show up in neat chunks

884
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,720
people modify it you have people to

885
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify the modified code but even more</font>

886
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,850
radically developers will pick up pieces

887
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,410
of open source code from one project and

888
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,560
slap<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their</font>

for the purposes of intellectual

891
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,000
property management you have to find it

892
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,890
because it's subject to the same

893
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,780
licenses and if it's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font>

the same security constraints so being

able to do very comprehensive scanning

898
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,590
is very important and again missing

thinking of integrating entire offering

of what we do in source code it would be

a good thing on the social side

918
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,869
certainly we find companies who from our

point of view have sub optimal

anything but whether that piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits the functional</font>

requirements for the use case they're

938
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:21,730
with securing the code like I talked

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded systems overall or they</font>

940
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,510
simply can't or they won't remediate

941
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,160
there may be our katek chiral issues to

942
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,930
prevent remediation just the code

943
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,609
doesn't fit they may have version

944

own Fork versions which can't be easily

947
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,020
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they've made so many</font>

948
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,150
changes or they haven't documented them

949
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:43,650
and then of course they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all suffering</font>

950
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:46,960
from different kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> warning fatigue</font>

951
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,670
so remediation of course is the result

952
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,130
we actually have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> practice called</font>

953
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,960
remediation strategy for all kinds of

954
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,970
remediation we don't do it ourselves we

955
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,770
sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> codebase we look at how</font>

956
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,450
it's been scanned and we help our

957
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,430
customers decide how they want to go

958
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,990
about remediation sometimes we actually

959
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,819
participate in it but usually not we

960
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,979
usually would just give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice on</font>

the most optimal<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do it and each</font>

security level remediation is you know

to maintain a fork within their own

1018
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,010
organization and we find this varies

1019
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,560
greatly with different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of</font>

unique part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source remediation</font>

that you don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other kinds of</font>

1033
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:53,060
you do remediation how you do automation

00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">in OSS hygiene and while it's possible</font>

1035
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it manually it's much better to</font>

1036
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,320
automate it there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just too much code</font>

1037
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,118
involved getting it done in time is a

1038
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,770
real problem if people are doing a

1039
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,380
mediation by hand they do it once every

1040

<font color="#E5E5E5">quarter or actually open source hygiene</font>

1041
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:11,570
maybe go to a scan and analysis once

1042
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,680
every quarter they'll they'll just look

1043
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,690
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it's ever it's convenient</font>

1044
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,368
whenever I have spare cycles which is

1045
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,610
equivalent to saying never most of the

1046
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:22,430
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's why automation is important</font>

1047
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:24,830
the accuracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of manual scanning is very</font>

very low<font color="#E5E5E5"> very problematic nice thing</font>

1049
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:29,000
about it with uh with tools it's a lot

1050
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,980
higher doing it comprehensively is very

1051
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,560
important latency of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

1052
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,150

<font color="#E5E5E5">getting to the next one can be weeks or</font>

latency is seldom more than hours

1056
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,649
especially if you're relating the

1057
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,690
vulnerability detection back to

1058
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:48,109

1061
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,369
not repeatable and the remediation is

1062
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:57,440
usually very subjective automating

1063
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,780
remediation on top of the SS hygiene

1064
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,380
means it's repeatable<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

where you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend your money doing</font>

1067
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,759
it manually is usually quantified in

actually fix the bugs it is what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1095
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:19,450
open source progresses the way it does

1096
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,828
and it's only working for open source

1097

although some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the methods could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1099
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:26,619
you're practicing this new discipline

1100
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:27,880
called inner source where you treat your

1101

internal development like it's open

1102

<font color="#E5E5E5">source then you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually apply the</font>

1103
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:35,650
same tools and methods to work you're

00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:38,619
doing behind your own firewall and it's

1105
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,299
a source discipline but we're trying to

1106
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:43,420
extend it to binaries as well by working

1107
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:44,980
with that so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is we're</font>

addressing a critical function in<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">act with open source hygiene we're not</font>

00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:52,569
making any claims that open source

1111
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,240
hygiene is something magical or special

1112
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:58,150
it just takes source code analysis tools

1113
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,759
and it applies a mix of community and

1114
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,109
vulnerability information it's not a

1115

replacement for other<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of security</font>

1116
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:07,509
tools it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a marketing gimmick it is</font>

1117
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:10,510
actionable methodology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font>

1118
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:12,130
and can be implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> by hand but just</font>

1119
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,589
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the resource to do it</font>

1120
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,390
or with automation and it certainly

1121
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:19,900
benefits from using computer technology

1122
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:21,788
at all levels but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's only really best</font>

1123
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,650
