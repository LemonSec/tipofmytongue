1
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:26,140
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody howdy starting a little</font>

2
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:31,689
bit early of course I do not intend to

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">run an hour and ten on this so don't</font>

4
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,449
worry I had a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people fall</font>

5
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">asleep on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last year and I think that</font>

6
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:37,629
was super reasonable considering the

7
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,699
nature of last year's talk so hopefully

8
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:42,610
i'll keep you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys going a little bit</font>

9
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,870
more this will be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time that</font>

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about really modern things</font>

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,940
we're going to dig into the history a

12
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,789
little bit of course because that's

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,730
where I draw a lot of my context from

14
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,929
but more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been thinking</font>

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,459
about what it means to feel safe what it

16
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:04,539
means to be secure what it means to be a

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:07,720
consumer of security when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> live in a</font>

18
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:11,560
situation of minimal risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact</font>

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:16,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the gross majority of end users of</font>

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:20,800
consumers either aren't at critical risk

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:26,080
on a regular basis or the consequences

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:29,910
of becoming victimized are so smooth by

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,679
other important parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our society and</font>

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,509
you know the fifth time that you get

25
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">your credit card reissued in the year</font>

26
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,360
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they caught whatever stupid</font>

27
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,250
thing happened to you before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lost</font>

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,929
all of your money those sorts of things

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,470
are smoothing out a lot of the

30
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:49,060
consequences for victimization as a

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,379
result we're pretty safe yes absolutely

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,060
there are swords of Damocles hanging

33
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:56,200
over our heads but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're trying to</font>

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sell to consumers it's a much harder</font>

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,520
sell than it used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly in</font>

36
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,920
America particularly right now so this

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,679
talk is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be about selling</font>

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,690
security in a post lock society<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

39
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:11,129
being glib with the post lock part will

40
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:14,440
dig into that as well I'm Skylar town

41
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:17,049
case you don't know me I'm really big

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,099
into locks pretty super into lock so a

43
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,629
lot of the stock is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus</font>

44
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,099
around locks and a head lock in the

45
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,280
title I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> joking about that it's</font>

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:27,010
all about locks but historically here at

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,170
RV a second other conferences I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

48
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,609
dig into the mechanical side of things

49
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,739
and I try to throw as much

50
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,200
the shore as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can so that you guys can</font>

51
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,650
draw whatever conclusions and whatever

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,299
metaphors<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can from it hopefully</font>

53
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:48,280
hopefully something useful so previously

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,230
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> our VA 2012</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave the talk why do</font>

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,390
you lock your door and in the stock I

56
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,390
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a strong argument for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

57
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,149
social and emotional nature of security

58
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,720
that there is a deeper connection to

59
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,430
security than most people realize as

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,550
they're moving through their lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

61
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:12,330
it can the trespass whether against<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

62
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,800
you trespassing someone else has a

63
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,830
physiological effect that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really</font>

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,810
feel it in the gut that your heart is

65
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,000
invested in security even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

66
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,709
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is this is going to come up</font>

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,959
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> today in 2013</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave the talk</font>

68
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,660
vulnerability research circuit 1851 in

69
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,980
which I tracked the rise<font color="#CCCCCC"> and decline of</font>

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:38,140
perfect security the death of perfect

71
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,000
security changed a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

72
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,899
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in depth in 2013 and</font>

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,400
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up once again and</font>

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally last year I explained how to</font>

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,780
make a lock from first principles all

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,458
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far back as i could</font>

77
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">start making locks and trying to explain</font>

78
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of the different things that go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

79
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,000
designing a lock and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

80
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kept coming back to slide after</font>

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,090
slide after slide of getting the new

82
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,570
format a more convenient format

83
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,549
something easier to use all sorts of

84
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,920
convenience and even regulatory

85
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,540
considerations that take place that have

86
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,238
nothing to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> making something more</font>

87
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,539
secure but are an enormous force on the

88
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,089
security industry and one that could

89
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,330
probably compromise with in more

90
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:28,349
effective ways so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is going</font>

91
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,349
to come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up again today</font>

92
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:40,610
there are four big tenants here the

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:43,400
first is that community is security when

94
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,470
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started thinking about the post lock</font>

95
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,880
world that we may or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

96
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,730
realized that i was about to spend a

97
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,890
significant amount of time studying how

98
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,200
people feel about security who don't

99
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,280
have to worry about security like the

100
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,390
data says they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to worry about</font>

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,669
it the logic says they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

102
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,560
worry about it how do they live with the

103
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,150
idea of security the idea of trespass

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,590
how they protect themselves have they

105
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,510
protect other people so on and so forth

106
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it is I mean I'm investigating white</font>

107
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,550
relatively wealthy suburbia a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,200
time I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to people who have</font>

109
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,610
never taken the time to think about

110
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things before in their lives</font>

111
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they have not had to and this</font>

112
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,130
massive segment of people who are

113
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,130
completely disconnected from an active

114
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,290
role in their own security have some

115
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:35,240
interesting norms that that wouldn't

116
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:37,760
have occurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me previously so I</font>

117
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,290
proposed formal debates at conferences a

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,550
while back and I'm pretty stoked that

119
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">our VA are going to be doing the speed</font>

120
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,500
debates tomorrow I am thrilled<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attend</font>

121
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,120
those I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find someone to debate</font>

122
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,220
me on the fact that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are living</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,500
post<font color="#E5E5E5"> la cage and that I would take all</font>

124
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">comers the offer still stands but it has</font>

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,680
to be an American because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the British</font>

126
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,930
are not living in a post la cage which

127
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a whole other talk that you can get</font>

128
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,440
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me at the table tomorrow the</font>

129
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,580
reason that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say this is coming out of</font>

130
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,610
1851 you know like three days after my

131
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,760
last talk ended back in history

132
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,240
literally 1851 there is this amazing

133
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,950
editorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I found where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font>

134
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,890
quite poetically and quite earnestly

135
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:25,190
suggested that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perfect security</font>

136
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,080
was dead now that we all knew that the

137
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,330
locks could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> open now that we all knew</font>

138
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,340
that we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> all securing ourselves</font>

139
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:36,770
behind locks that we knew how to open

140
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:40,520
perhaps our mutual vulnerability would

141
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,950
create mutual empathy but perhaps we

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,190
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> merging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a post lock age and we</font>

143
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,030
would

144
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:49,900
be a better society as a result of it

145
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:53,000
when i first read that five years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

146
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,000
thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was hilarious go man locks</font>

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,070
her everywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> billion dollar industry</font>

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,470
still you know worldwide nobody lives

149
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,640
that locks the very rare exceptions that

150
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:07,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">i could find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two people living without</font>

151
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:10,219
locks were enormous outliers and yet it

152
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,740
was really burning me as a matter of

153
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,230
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was giving a talk elsewhere and i</font>

154
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,910
was telling the anecdote about this

155
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,580
guy's editorial and saying oh and i

156
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,350
laughed at it and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that moment on</font>

157
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,840
stage that I thought wait a minute I

158
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he might be right so I said so in</font>

159
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,310
that talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had no idea how to back it</font>

160
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,590
up I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I was thinking</font>

161
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,040
what this might lead to but it was a

162
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment of genuine not inspiration but</font>

163
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,220
genuine curiosity and I wanted to

164
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,900
challenge myself by saying it publicly

165
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,240
so then I said it publicly again on

166
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:47,060
Twitter and I have some people that that

167
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,169
are attempting to take me<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on it so</font>

168
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,820
the reason this is coming to a head

169
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,659
recently as I did a show called going

170
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,940
deep with David Rees on natgeo cool show

171
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,860
we talked about locks my segment wound

172
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,200
up being very short and really nicely

173
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,830
done and edited and funny and great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they did an awesome job I shot</font>

175
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,300
with them for half of a day and for

176
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">about two hours of that was just a</font>

177
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,570
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> between me and David in</font>

178
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:17,030
front of a pile<font color="#E5E5E5"> of locks and I can talk</font>

179
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,620
for much longer than two hours about

180
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,059
locks and all of the weird things that I

181
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,980
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about locks and so on and so forth</font>

182
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,220
and we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the social</font>

183
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,540
nature of them we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

184
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know mechanical peas have been</font>

185
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,650
encoding information that they're your

186
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,479
passwords and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth all of</font>

187
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:37,218
these like interesting subtle nuance

188
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,500
ideas because he was so excited he was

189
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:43,610
thrilled that all of the ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at</font>

190
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,839
the moment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said you know people</font>

191
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,550
approach me all the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they say oh</font>

192
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,710
where i grew up we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lock</font>

193
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,439
our doors nobody locked their doors blah

194
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,390
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will say to them yes but</font>

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,160
an unlocked door is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an unused lock</font>

196
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,880
it is no testament to the security of

197
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,740
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font>

198
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,970
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that off if</font>

199
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,040
you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demonstrate the</font>

200
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,610
security of your community<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove the</font>

201
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:10,849
locks from your doors don't have locks

202
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:12,800
and as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to him but</font>

203
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody ever takes me up on that but</font>

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,370
that's a step too far or whatever I was

205
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,250
going to say as I opened my mouth he

206
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,190
said oh my god let's do that let's go

207
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,510
take the lock off my door let's see how

208
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,670
long it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my neighborhood</font>

209
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,010
to notice let's see how it makes them

210
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,990
feel to find out that I'm living without

211
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,030
a log let's see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels to me to</font>

212
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,570
come home with no lock on my door and he

213
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,949
just approached it with such excited

214
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,960
enthusiasm that he completely bowled me

215
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:43,550
over and I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wonder if anybody</font>

216
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">else out there unfortunately he had had</font>

217
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,780
just gotten a roommate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was not</font>

218
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,610
involved in this conversation so I blame

219
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,560
him not at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> for not going through</font>

220
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,530
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a matter of fact I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

221
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,239
that it was incredibly exciting that he

222
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,030
approached it with that much enthusiasm

223
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,330
and it completely inspired the next year

224
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,680
of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of side research for me so I</font>

225
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,360
began wondering if there's anybody else

226
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,609
like David Rees out there who would be

227
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,090
willing to go completely lock less no

228
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,140
lock on the door whatsoever and then

229
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,210
like right as I'm starting to think

230
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this I got a coupon for Google</font>

231
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,840
consumer surveys sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well just</font>

232
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people if they're willing</font>

233
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it and the survey was terrible the</font>

234
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,500
survey data I am NOT going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show it to</font>

235
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the survey date is awful you should</font>

236
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,160
not believe the number i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am about to</font>

237
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,229
show you because I was really bad at

238
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,150
composing surveys at that moment in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

239
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,770
I learned a lot some friend tried to

240
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,449
help me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we combined the data of the</font>

241
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">two surveys it's all a complete</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disaster</font>

242
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,300
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following information is</font>

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,980
absolutely inaccurate but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

244
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,839
show you anyway I ask people<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font>

245
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,550
could feel safe without locks at all I

246
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,990
also asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> them if they wanted more</font>

247
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,400
locks I also ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they like</font>

248
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,520
their locks I<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked them way too many</font>

249
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,170
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about locks but the people who</font>

250
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,900
decided they could feel safer that locks

251
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,579
at all taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data from both surveys</font>

252
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,319
the one that was slightly more rigorous

253
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,320
and my complete disaster of a survey

254
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,790
gonna edit the video right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

255
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,510
still plugged in does anybody know

256
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:29,339
what's up with the feed you're getting

257
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:37,860
it back there what was that oh yeah the

258
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:42,930
lamp isn't on but not a bad thing that

259
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">we started earlier um what was that yeah</font>

260
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,729
yeah can't even show you the damn data

261
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:52,730
that was such a reveal to that was such

262
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:54,600
a like here it is killed the projector

263
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,890
what else can I tell you guys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

264
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,940
meanwhile stuff about locks I'm trying

265
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff about locks it</font>

266
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't this talk of it so far I just</font>

267
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,279
ran my timings like three times on this

268
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:10,560
talk which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when this would happen of</font>

269
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:12,750
course which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fine I'm starting to</font>

270
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on another thing i'm going to vamp</font>

271
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,100
on this for a minute because it's

272
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:21,029
interesting research it's completely new

273
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,320
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i said i intend to have</font>

274
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,689
somebody cut the section out of the

275
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,250
video until we get up into here so not

276
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:32,250
at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> for distribution yet but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

277
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:37,860
starting to investigate a theory that

278
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:41,070
locks come before all other societal

279
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,170
structures of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a couple</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can interrupt me if you</font>

282
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:54,390

283
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:57,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of points of data on</font>

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,920
remember and I would look it up but I'm

288
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:10,500
afraid of touching anything over here

289
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:15,860
wrote this amazing paper studying<font color="#E5E5E5"> tele</font>

290
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,899
bekhoon a te ll I think dash e bekhoon

291
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bak un I don't know why I thought</font>

292
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one would be the thing that you</font>

293
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:26,420
knew how to spell and a was the specific

294
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:31,060
period of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular excavation and</font>

295
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,060
there he discovers for the first time

296
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,430
thank you guys I'll finish that one

297
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,890
thought and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I will hop back over</font>

298
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,260
here he discovers for the first time the

299
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">first door seals we've ever seen the</font>

300
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,689
first time people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sealing doors and</font>

301
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,569
he makes a beautiful intelligent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

302
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,899
think super strong argument for the door

303
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,089
seal being be transitional technology

304
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:00,410
between its tribal society and a

305
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:02,660
civilized society and then the 1851

306
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:07,040
stuff anyway maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be back next</font>

307
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:13,399
you're talking about that so going to do

308
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,870
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people if they</font>

309
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,990
could feel safe for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that locks at all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

310
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,190
also ask them how they like their locks

311
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,600
I asked them if they wanted more locks

312
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,990
ask them way too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things about walks</font>

313
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,120
and so the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is awful but putting my</font>

314
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:31,220
survey together putting the other survey

315
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:34,610
together three to seven percent of

316
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,170
respondents suggested that they could

317
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,949
feel comfortable living without walks at

318
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:41,719
all again that isn't true this is

319
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrible data please don't trust this</font>

320
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,470
but man it's interesting even though I

321
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:50,149
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can't be verified and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

322
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,480
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point in time and</font>

323
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,250
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth but man I was like</font>

324
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,170
sitting at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bar getting the responses i</font>

325
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,420
was like oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> must have screwed this up</font>

326
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,189
badly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did it turned out i did i'll</font>

327
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,500
get off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this rant anyway but it's but</font>

328
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,660
so exciting and so curious that there

329
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,640
might be this<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of a significant</font>

330
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,170
percentage of people in America again

331
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,959
this is an American<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing at the moment</font>

332
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,479
it's probably a canadian thing but but

333
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm focused on America but there are</font>

334
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,050
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that might be willing to</font>

335
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the locks off their doors that</font>

336
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,810
might actually feel that strong in their

337
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,730
community self the lack of consequences

338
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,758
whatever it is that's making them feel

339
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,919
safe it isn't locks

340
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,989
and there are a bunch of other

341
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,679
respondents that basically confirmed

342
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:39,179
that there is a big minority of people

343
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,459
who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see locks as anything that</font>

344
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,809
keeps them safe so even if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

345
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:46,679
willing to remove the locks from their

346
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:50,279
door they still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't trust the lock on</font>

347
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,689
their door they trust other things in

348
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,799
their environment they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

349
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:55,169
think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure how to</font>

350
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,299
express it I went and and you know

351
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,559
verbally interviewed several people and

352
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:03,509
we'll talk about that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit as</font>

353
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:05,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">well so I then thought about David's</font>

354
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,289
other question how would someone feel if

355
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:12,179
they found out I was living without

356
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:13,859
locks and what a great question this

357
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,389
isn't what I expected I ask people<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

358
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:18,139
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel less safe more safe or</font>

359
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:20,639
neutral got a lot better at my options

360
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:22,229
the question is if a neighbor told you

361
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,499
they had decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live without any</font>

362
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:27,929
locks on their home would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel less</font>

363
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:30,329
safe more safe or neutral neutral of

364
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:32,399
course was the majority their responses

365
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:34,138
were a little less interesting but

366
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of respondents felt</font>

367
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:43,049
less safe as a result of a neighbor

368
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:45,660
ceasing to use locks I'll explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> why in</font>

369
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:47,759
a minute but that blew my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind I was</font>

370
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,350
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised by that so he pushed</font>

371
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,019
further we turned that one into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

372
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,359
multiple and I say we excited people

373
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,309
helping me at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage if several</font>

374
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:57,509
neighbors told you that they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

375
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:00,689
live without any locks on their homes

376
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:03,389
would you feel thirty-six percent would

377
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:05,029
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> less safe as a result of the</font>

378
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,109
defection of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbors their</font>

379
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:08,819
neighbors defecting against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal</font>

380
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,549
would make them in their home feel less

381
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,898
safe now when I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing this</font>

382
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:14,849
pouring in and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was this</font>

383
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,018
significant a number of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh by the</font>

384
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,599
way we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the more safe</font>

385
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,919
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> too because I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's a</font>

386
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,779
decent<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of more safe people out</font>

387
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,990
here who just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oh man there's an</font>

388
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,339
easier target than me now great<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah you</font>

389
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,480
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think like the less safe people</font>

390
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'll explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference</font>

391
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,129
my initial thought about the less safe

392
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,400
people was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were probably</font>

393
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,590
thinking oh this is inviting trouble

394
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,020
this is the you know broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

395
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,730
theory that if we let things go to heck

396
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we're inviting trouble into our</font>

397
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,340
neighborhood so on and so forth I

398
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,550
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what the</font>

399
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,010
perception is admittedly I haven't you

400
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,260
know manually verbally in person

401
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,580
interviewed the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> response group I</font>

402
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,050
haven't even interviewed anybody that

403
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,480
was in this of course because it's all

404
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,340
anonymous but as I continue this as I

405
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked people personally as I you know</font>

406
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,230
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of strangers that I was able</font>

407
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see immediately in front of me and</font>

408
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,070
I've had these conversations I've met a

409
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,690
lot of less safes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

410
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,189
feel less safe as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

411
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:20,809
none of them are telling me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

412
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's inviting trouble there is a</font>

413
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:25,910
significant minority of people whose

414
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,650
sense of their personal security and

415
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:34,030
compasses their community<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

416
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:37,910
use my mother as an example my mother is

417
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:40,220
in her late 60's now she's a delight she

418
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,460
still you know shovels the<font color="#E5E5E5"> driveway or</font>

419
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,070
an old Vermont farming stock love her to

420
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,650
death she knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a neighbor was on a</font>

421
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,870
trip some winter and we live we were in

422
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:54,830
the safest little suburb of the tiniest

423
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,928
charming town but she went because we

424
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,379
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden Blizzard she went and she's</font>

425
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:03,110
blew out their entire driveway and their

426
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,730
walk to their door and swept off the

427
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:09,860
walk so it would look like they were

428
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:13,429
home hours of effort because of an

429
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,020
unexpected snowstorm and I don't know

that she even<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaks to these people on</font>

431
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,639
a regular basis but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're her</font>

432
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:24,800
neighbors she might I'm sorry mom if you

433
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:26,300
do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that I talked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

434
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,889
were in the less safe camp<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font>

435
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,730
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> said to me over and over again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

436
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,530
would be more on watch it would what I

437
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,270
was getting from them was<font color="#E5E5E5"> was less that</font>

438
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,670
they would feel less safe but more that

439
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,460
they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be on guard now and</font>

440
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,830
they didn't have to be before this

441
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,039
question was asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had to</font>

442
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,460
watch out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their name</font>

443
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:51,629
is that their security was completely

444
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:56,039
tied to their community the more saves

445
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:57,238
as we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be safer for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them if</font>

446
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,309
some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is living in that</font>

447
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:01,229
locks you know they're the they're the

448
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,580
easiest path the path of<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

449
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:06,739
resistance<font color="#E5E5E5"> for somebody that wants to</font>

450
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,939
cause trouble and the neutrals were

451
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:14,489
again not as interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but</font>

452
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,200
definitely kind of predictable that's

453
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:18,419
what I got from a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people like it</font>

454
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,779
does not matter to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the locks don't do</font>

455
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:24,359
anything security is an illusion and

456
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,340
this occasionally bums me out because if

457
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,109
you really need we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get you</font>

458
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:33,299
serious security you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can invest you can</font>

459
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:36,299
make it happen but you know in a certain

460
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,759
way they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not wrong and so between the</font>

461
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,979
less safes and the Securities and

462
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">illusion people we have a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

463
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:45,269
that are I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant to say</font>

464
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:46,649
between the more safes and the

465
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:50,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">Securities illusion people we have a lot</font>

466
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:55,109
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are valuing locks less</font>

467
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:56,189
than our other minorities so well we'll

468
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:59,070
circle back to that and why that's

469
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,859
important number two here is that we

470
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,349
have nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fear that's not entirely</font>

471
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:06,899
true this sort of advertisement this was

472
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:08,580
for a safe your house is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on fire this</font>

473
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,099
may be the warning cry you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear some</font>

474
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,299
night and they said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

475
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:13,678
our safe in your house you won't lose

476
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,379
your important documents so on and so

477
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,710
forth and that's that's how advertising

478
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:21,928
was that's how marketing was in security

479
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,529
and fire safety in all of that stuff it

480
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:28,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">was just things are terrifying and we</font>

481
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:30,840
can help you that is dramatically less

482
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,090
effective now dramatically less

483
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:38,189
effective I don't mean that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

484
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,369
have nothing to fear and there are a lot

485
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,690
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that fear a lot of things that</font>

486
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:44,519
logically by the data whatever you want

487
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:50,369
to say they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily need to</font>

488
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:52,740
fear I was recently burgled and that

489
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:57,510
sucked

490
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:59,770
but it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter all that much I</font>

491
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,740
lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a camera that was important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

492
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:05,020
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my forensics work I had to pick</font>

493
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:09,510
glass out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a toilet which was really</font>

494
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:14,350
annoying my wife and my in-laws felt

495
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:17,140
awful and that sucked I hated that but I

496
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,580
boarded up the window assess the other

497
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,930
damage they did they did a lot of damage

498
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,540
took them quite a few tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

499
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">my house I feel good about that the</font>

500
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,170
things that were stolen sucked sharing a

501
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,520
laptop with my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> coasters was stolen</font>

502
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:33,640
that was frustrating for a while for

503
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:36,040
both of us she hates<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows but we had</font>

504
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,540
friends sent us payers really fancy

505
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,480
payers from Harry and David right

506
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,740
afterwards and chocolates and mixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuts</font>

507
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh we had friends that wrote to us and</font>

508
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,590
said hey let's get together at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

509
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,760
house so you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to feel more</font>

510

comfortable so you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you own it</font>

511
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,780
again our insurance company put us in

512
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,790
touch with the contractor insurance

513
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,850
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> is paying what is appropriate</font>

514
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:57,879
for the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happened I went</font>

515
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,860
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work the next day we had 48 hours of</font>

516
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,300
feeling a little bit uncomfortable

517
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaving our home alone or having either</font>

of us be alone in the home<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

519
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:08,260
had all you friggin paranoid hacker

520
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,899
saying man are you sure you haven't been

521
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,190
targeted check the place to see if

522
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,930
you've been bugged so that kind of

523
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:20,230
sucked for like 48 hours as I was like

524
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:22,060
oh embracing your paranoia but it was

525
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,760
also really weird i had<font color="#E5E5E5"> just finished</font>

526
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,870
this project we<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was working with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

527
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,430
guys in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety nine percent because we</font>

528
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,100
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together an episode on perfect</font>

529
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,360
security on all that 1851 stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

530
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,750
felt like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pin in that and</font>

531
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,610
that went out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was so excited and i</font>

532
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,560
arrived<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and I said oh babe why'd</font>

533
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,810
you leave the<font color="#CCCCCC"> garage door unlocked she</font>

534
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,899
didn't walked in together<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we even</font>

535
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:46,270
Berlin<font color="#CCCCCC"> is such a surreal experience to</font>

536
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,790
be studying<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff you know anyway</font>

537
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,700
uh I'm digressing a little bit here but

538
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:54,178
all I mean to say is that sucked but I'm

539
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,539
not afraid of it happening again

540
00:23:54,179 --> 00:24:01,919
I hate that someone did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I'm not</font>

541
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:04,619
afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I had a couple of weeks</font>

542
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">of frustration and annoyance but I'm not</font>

543
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:09,178
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be what the</font>

544
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:11,399
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life is bound you know we</font>

545
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,320
keep locking our doors we replace the

546
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:15,689
lock we<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace the window we use our</font>

547
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,889
sash locks all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time now so that's</font>

548
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,950
good those<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing that we should</font>

549
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:21,779
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all okay the</font>

550
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,259
consequences of victimization have been

551
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:30,600
smooth for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us not all of us but</font>

552
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:31,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a lot of us unless you lie to us so</font>

553
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,119
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell</font>

554
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:37,740
security that are just lying I gave

555
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">Haven lock the benefit of the doubt when</font>

556
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,259
i published my paper last<font color="#E5E5E5"> november on</font>

557
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:45,480
the current state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of smart locks they</font>

558
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,119
offered a bunch of facts on their

559
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">website such as with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-five percent</font>

560
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,379
of break-ins requiring some force hours

561
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:54,559
creates a stir your support system

562
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:57,059
that's not true that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true at all</font>

563
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,009
look at the FBI crime statistics look at

564
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,399
the bureau of justice statistics about

565
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:04,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-thirds require some amount of force</font>

566
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:06,719
sometimes that and often that force is

567
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,119
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much related to win goose and</font>

568
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,369
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't blocked by anything</font>

569
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,928
like this then two thirds is a hell of a

there that were provably false and it

573
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,399
pissed me off because i feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the other people in this market a lot</font>

companies are embracing a lot of the

convenience they're selling to people in

580
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,860
that social way they're selling to

581
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:38,100
people great optimistic feelings about

Paul Gerhardt CEO of lockitron said one

588
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,760
of the most beautiful things that I've

589
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:05,090
heard in a long time he was talking

590
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,400
about security he makes an electronic

591
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,740
lock but he said walls are designed to

592
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:16,480
keep people out locks are there to

593
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:16,480

society those are our communities those

652
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:43,279
are all of the other aspects of security

653

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we never think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that are doing</font>

a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> job so I don't want to be sold</font>

655
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:57,649
fear anymore walks have been sold in a

656
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,309
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways over a very long</font>

657
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:02,689
period of time back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the late 1700s</font>

658
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,549
and early<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighteen hundreds when we were</font>

659
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,760
first finally getting really serious

660
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:09,769
locks it was super novel super novel

661
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,450
that a lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like work in a serious</font>

662
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,360
way at all super novel you would have a

663
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,730
lock that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else couldn't open</font>

664
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,408
and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> great there were miles</font>

665
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,769
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anything that had come before</font>

666
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:23,990
and so the people making them published

667
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,419
every bit of information you could hope

668
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,130
to know about these locks this is a new

669
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:30,049
thing was quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> navia to inform people</font>

670
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,149
you had to tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything about it</font>

671
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:33,440
and people read about it people talked

672
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:35,268
about it people discuss these things

673
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,860
people wrote letters to the editor

674
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,059
saying I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure about this piece of</font>

675
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,500
information they gave and they'd write

676
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:41,120
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be like yours also be in philly</font>

677
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,980
about the piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information it was</font>

678
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,129
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and creating</font>

679
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,860
legitimacy for these security products

680
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:53,179
that's great now those<font color="#CCCCCC"> were really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

681
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:55,459
times the mid-1700s it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rise</font>

682
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:57,710
of a lot of professional crime it's the

683
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,169
rise of fences in particular which allow

684
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,090
burglary to just explode and the

685
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:05,179
consumerism of the early seventeen

686
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,918
hundreds had created the market for the

687
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,289
fences for the burglars and it was just

688
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,750
the locks hadn't caught up policing

689
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:15,309
didn't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lynn a real formal</font>

690
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:19,049
civilized way yet none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

691
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:21,509
existed until the locks came in

692
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:22,679
and everybody had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to trust</font>

693
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:24,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in the way that they were going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

694
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,360
trust them was by getting all of the

695
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:28,709
information great now things get a

696
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,149
little bit better it's not the bad old

697
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,730
days anymore there's some scary things

698
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:34,139
that happen after 1851 because all of

699
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,149
the locks have been picked but everybody

700
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:38,879
suddenly realizes even though the locks

701
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:41,908
have been picked we're all doing pretty

702
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:43,649
ok this is in the 1700s anymore things

703
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:46,019
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have professional police we</font>

704
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:47,729
have you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gas lamps have been</font>

705
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,129
here forever<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are great now</font>

706
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,220
we're not walking and being murdered in

707
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:55,559
the dark every<font color="#E5E5E5"> night it's probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

708
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:59,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what the 1700s were like but</font>

709
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,970
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you see a lot of hard</font>

710
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,710
branding a lot of serious branding

711

somewhere you had described it in depth

715
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,389

<font color="#CCCCCC">because we very rarely see descriptions</font>

00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,589
this is

the best description they say walk

809
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,980
pumping is done with a bump key which

810
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:51,049
means you modify a key with deep cuts

811
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,418
then put it in give it a tap or two and

812
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,610
you're in this is a super surface

813
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:57,799
understanding of it fine they then go on

814
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,090
to say gene holder with<font color="#E5E5E5"> holder security</font>

815
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,650
says this works because the vast

816
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,390
majority of locks are pin tumbler locks

817
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,830
which means there are two sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

818
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,930
tumblers in the lock<font color="#CCCCCC"> and once you tap</font>

819
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:08,540
the bump key it separates the tumblers

820
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,490
to the key then turns that is so much

821

about this for 75 years but we haven't

852
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:22,490
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you to protect you that was</font>

853
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,280
what they said it was three paragraphs

854
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:27,259
in a press release<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's exactly</font>

855
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,430
what they were saying said we've known

856
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,320
about this for 75 years we do this but

857
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,330
we weren't going to tell you and now

858
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,700
that these idiots have<font color="#E5E5E5"> blown the secret</font>

859
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:40,069
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all less safe if you want to be</font>

860
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,740
more safe trust in a lowest certified

<font color="#CCCCCC">it out for yourself</font>

863
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,540
so as consumers of course we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> crave</font>

864
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,610
convenience like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said convenience has</font>

865
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,590
always been a part of the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

selling security and it's an important

history of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick-set corporation</font>

869
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,230
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> for better or worse and it many</font>

870
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,270
times in their history it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was for worse</font>

871
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,860
they were the kings of convenience and

00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,870
security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't quite realize what</font>

873
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:15,250
an outsized influence they had on the

consumer until I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back through their</font>

876
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,180
history so you know initially they just

877
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,860
make a lock<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anybody can install and</font>

878
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,930
they do the steering the post-world war

879
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,150
two housing boom and they make a ton of

880
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,379
money as a result because now people can

881
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,340
slap their own locks in their doors they

882
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,740
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a locksmith to come and</font>

890
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,980
people when you know millions of houses

00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:50,680
were being built in 64 they introduced

892
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,720
their quixey packaging and everybody in

893
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,399
their industry is forced to follow suit

894
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,930
this is the first time that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pick</font>

looks like see all of that stuff first

899
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,990
time that you're able to do this and

900
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,580
consumers loved it they love to having

901
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,290
access to that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that immediate</font>

904
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,330
of their competitors<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to follow suit</font>

you go to Home Depot<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to lowes</font>

keyless entry for homes I did not know

that I learned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the course of</font>

911
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:30,460
putting this together I shocked that in

912
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:35,620
2002 they introduced their quick install

913
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:37,990
which was a just a slightly newer

914
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,460
version of their already<font color="#E5E5E5"> decent install</font>

00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">it yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> product but the deal with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this one was that all the screws were</font>

917
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,760
like pre together and just kind of had

918
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to twist things in place and so this is</font>

919
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,150
super handy for people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was also</font>

920
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,980
addressing an important security problem

bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> consumers biometrics</font>

anybody was using the word smart lock

948
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:59,020

of your codes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in case you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font>

994
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,770
the combination to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lock they can</font>

995
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:47,919
back it up online in case you forget and

996
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:51,009
they can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out they also say that</font>

997
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,859
it is high security once just high

998
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,030
security cool and afterwards at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font>

999
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:57,910
end the very last thing we say is

1000
00:41:55,030 --> 00:42:00,490
shackles pretty good too they say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1001
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a hardened boron shackle awesome</font>

1002
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:04,930
so they bookend it with we're secure

1003
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,109
check it out we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure and then</font>

1004
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:10,629
they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-15 conversations about</font>

1005
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,490
convenience and how it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy and</font>

1006
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,049
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will solve small problems that</font>

1007
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:19,899
you've had and implementing security in

1008
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:21,970
the past and for better or worse however

1009
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:26,559
good this lock is I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

1010
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:28,118
good because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

1011
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:32,410
convenience and security are not a

1012
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,059
dichotomy sometimes when you force

1013
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,009
convenience yes you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a step</font>

1014
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:38,380
away from security but really

1015
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:43,720
importantly inconvenience invites and

1016
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:45,430
security this is actually a really

1017
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,910
clever solution to the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

1018
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:51,430
solving a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> agencies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1019
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,529
individuals need access to what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1020
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:55,299
blocking so every one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> has their</font>

1021
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,910
own lock and they just made a chain out

1022
00:42:55,299 --> 00:43:01,059
of their locks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to point out</font>

1023
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:04,420
to you that this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> master number</font>

1024
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:06,010
three and this either of these I don't

1025
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:09,220
know if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a medico or not but</font>

1026
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:11,020
these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> serious all-weather much</font>

1027
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:14,040
higher security bad Luck's but that

1028
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:17,500
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter because some idiot</font>

1029
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,509
someone put a master number three on

1030
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,559
there and now literally weakest link in

1031
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,559
the chain situation

1032
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,220
it's silly and it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

1033
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">right lock for it but that dial speed</font>

1034
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,330
has five<font color="#E5E5E5"> different guest access numbers</font>

1035
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,830
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could share between multiple</font>

people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a community that needed access</font>

1037
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,569
to the same space then you could have a

1038
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:40,970
strong chain one lock for better<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1039
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:43,580
worse but at least everybody is on par

1040
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:47,240
there you're not bowing to the the

1041

weakest member of the team inconvenience

wanted this open someone had to call the

Forest Service who have one of the locks

doing anything but having to call that

one guy every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single time they needed</font>

attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what that something is</font>

1065
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:45,110
because if you interfere with it if you

1066
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,330
make it inconvenient for them they will

1067
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,770
obviate your security they will find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

password a word to this lock since the

1840s that has existed what's super cool

1115
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:41,210
about word lock is the algorithm when

1116
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:44,240
you buy a word lock all of those wheels

1117

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been chosen the letters on those</font>

maximum number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of combinations of real</font>

00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:54,920
words because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with word</font>

1121
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:58,460
locks before word lock the brand is that

00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the key space was tiny yes you could</font>

1123
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,550
pick a random combination of letters but

word lock gave you an enormous key space

1127

because they analyzed it they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

right letters on the right wheels and

the right combinations and it's not all

the ways the word locks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have always been</font>

1134
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,830
convenient but keeping in mind the

1135
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:29,270
security allowing people to participate

your family has access to their home

1140

sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1141

gave him got a keypad lock for his

1145
00:47:52,999 --> 00:47:57,950
trepidatious about it but it felt great

1146
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:59,239
because when he left his house now he no

1147
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,098
longer had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry if he had the key</font>

1148
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:02,269
could he go out for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> run right now yes</font>

wife isn't going to get locked out

1151
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,339
because he accidentally grabbed the

1155
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:16,459

1158
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:24,019
great and it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

into the fact that people care beyond

00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:39,769
themselves beyond their families but

1164
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:41,749
care about the security behaviors of

those in their communities and don't you

dare go trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scare them about that</font>

1167
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:50,569
but communicate them with them about

do convenience has to go hand in hand

1198
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:01,730
with security but convenience can

1199
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:03,649
enhance security if your tool isn't

the people my parents<font color="#CCCCCC"> my parents when I</font>

gave them a touch pad lock similar

1220
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,270
experience but I swear it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

1221
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,830
time they ever thought something i did

1222
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:05,150
with blocks was at all interesting and

1223
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:08,120
they raved about it they loved using it

1224
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:10,580
it was fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them and they stopped</font>

00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:19,430
hiding keys behind things on the

1226

property which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is awesome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I digress this</font>

1227
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:24,830
is who I am I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take some</font>

1228
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,390
questions and I potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

1229
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,890
little more survey data to cover if you

guys are interested in it about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1231
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:37,310
regulatory stuff but yeah that's me any

1232
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:41,060
questions fabulous I teased you with the

1233

survey data<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

1234
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,090
fifth thing I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> dug into this</font>

1235
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,650
enough yet but be careful with

1236
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,780
legislating things particularly in

1237
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:50,630
Europe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of interaction</font>

1238
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,890
between insurance companies and the

1239
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:55,280
sorts of locks that you are allowed to

1240
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:56,600
have on your home in in England<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1241
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,430
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> controversial programs where</font>

1242

police will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around trying doors and</font>

1243
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:01,879
then reporting to insurance companies

1244
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:04,100
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are leaving doors</font>

1245
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,900
unlocked if it is determined that you

1246
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,509
left your door unlocked

1247
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,760
it is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is obvious of course that you</font>

1248
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,900
will that you will not get a payout from

1249
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,579
the insurance company because you

1250
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,270
invited it i'll hit you right after this

1251
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:18,980
thank you so it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1252
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:20,839
situation there are a lot of regulations

1253
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,089
around the standards the standards that

1254
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:25,160
we have in America we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few things</font>

1255
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:26,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">about physical resistance we have a lot</font>

1256
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,690
of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> about build quality but we</font>

1257
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:31,789
don't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about actual prevention</font>

1258
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,579
of access a lot of nothing about

1259
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:38,000
surreptitious stuff really whatsoever

1260
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:42,170
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in part that's because we</font>

1261
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,170
hate regulation so testing this theory I

1262
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:47,150
asked another I basically I passed this

your neighborhood or apartment building

1271
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:07,520
mandated the use of locks on all

residences I want to be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear the</font>

1273
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,500
only thing we're asking them is if they

1274
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:14,538
mandated that we have locks most people

1275
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,460
have never even imagined I promise I'll

1276
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:17,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you what it says I'm sorry most</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have never even imagined going</font>

1278
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:23,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">without a lock and so I'm just asking</font>

1279
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:25,069
them that baseline what if our you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1280
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:26,390
neighborhood organization mandated that

1281
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:29,180
everybody had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lock in this</font>

1282
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:31,250
community almost fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1283
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,569
would be supportive of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that about forty</font>

1284
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of people would be neutral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1285
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:37,009
thirteen percent would be opposed to

1286
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:40,069
even that level of regulation just

1287
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:41,779
saying they have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lock now as</font>

1288
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:45,049
we extend this outward if your town or

1289
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:47,150
city proposes this forty-one percent

1290

would be supportive at the town city

level neutral sitting at 39 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> oppose</font>

1292
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,440
jumps up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to almost twenty percent now as</font>

1293
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,480
we expand further away from the

00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:00,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">community that we consider part of our</font>

1295
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,420
realm of security if your state proposes

00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:04,670
it neutral now is winning at forty-five

1297
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,289
percent supportive has dropped all the

1298
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,730
way down to thirty three percent and

<font color="#E5E5E5">opposed was now finally crossed that</font>

1300
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:11,329
twenty percent threshold now I did go on

1301
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:13,520
to ask about what it would be like at

1302
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:15,289
the national level<font color="#E5E5E5"> and oh the script</font>

1303
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,630
flipped but I think it might be because

1304
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:20,190
I use the word Congress

1305
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:23,489
word choice is super important so I do

1306
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:25,440
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the the final data point but</font>

1307
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:27,390
all man if you're if you're mandating

1308
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,390
the use of locks just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use of locks</font>

00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:33,089

locks of a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know whatever if you're</font>

1311
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:36,359
mandating the use of locks people are

1312
00:54:34,259 --> 00:54:38,819
not into that on the national level holy

1313
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:41,940
crap but in their own communities you

1314
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:43,288
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some traction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's the</font>
