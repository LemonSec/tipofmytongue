00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:26,630
okay well I welcome and thanks for

00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:28,279
attending today my talk is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,729
art of<font color="#CCCCCC"> postinfection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responsive</font>

4
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:34,640
mitigation and it's been described as

5
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,430
brutal truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that you get some</font>

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,360
brutal truth out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk today so</font>

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,180
what the hell just happened on my

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,309
network hopefully that's not a question

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">your boss is asking you at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

10
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,720
moment maybe it's a question you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

11
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:50,510
yourself now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell</font>

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,100
happened on my network are you making

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,750
any kind of effort to find out what

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,000
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your network or are you</font>

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,299
pushing the easy button as kids was

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,799
mentioning earlier we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

17
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,260
over some bare bones we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

18
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,000
over some response methodologies this

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,640
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is specifically about malware</font>

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,810
breaches we're not dealing with sequel

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,990
injection or anything like that it's

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,080
just malware breaches because it's a hot

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:20,689
thing nowadays so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get started</font>

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:23,658
oops<font color="#E5E5E5"> um who the hell am I well my name</font>

25
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:26,329
is Caleb some people call<font color="#CCCCCC"> me chill some</font>

26
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:27,770
people tell me to chill by the end of

27
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:29,898
this talk you may have put me in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,298
those two categories i'm a senior

29

malware analyst at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the media trust the</font>

30
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,539
media trust actually has nothing to do

31
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:40,669
with this talk by the way they do

32
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:42,799
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that involves our analysis to</font>

33
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,609
the degree i'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here what</font>

34
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:51,350
we do is content verification if you go

35
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to any major website like yahoo chances</font>

36
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,710
are good that we're probably monitoring

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,889
all the third fourth fifth party content

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,708
on that web site for malicious things so

39
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:03,289
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more pre infection and this</font>

40
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,880
is post-infection obviously i'm the

58
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">has nothing to do with this talk and</font>

59
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:51,290
it's just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best quotes ever so</font>

60
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,988
a little bit about what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

61
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,569
go over today we're going to talk about

62
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area that's post-infection and</font>

63
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,078
we've all heard about malware breaches

64
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,719
you hear about Mauer breaches nearly

65
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,099
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're on</font>

66
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter you probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

67
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,988
every second we're going to go over

68
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,750
Mauer breach response methodologies some

69
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,030
good some bad and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go over</font>

70
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,669
some battle planning maybe have some

71
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,590
response in place once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get breached</font>

72
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:21,949
because you will and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

73
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,239
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them tools so at the end</font>

74
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,669
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk I'm just going to go over a</font>

75
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,000
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I tend to use on a</font>

76
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:30,889
daily basis just to kind of look more

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,319
into the system see what's going on and

78
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:37,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually find out what the hell happen</font>

79
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,958
on your network so on we go why is

80
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:43,579
post-infection kind of a gray area

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,099
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a question does anyone</font>

82
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:51,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any idea wide it's kind of a blurry</font>

83
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:54,948
area mm-hmm scope actually that's that's

84
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:58,040
a good one um I've really outlined three

85
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:01,549
main reasons it's a gray area scopes

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,159
good one though um the first one is

87
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:07,209
something if<font color="#CCCCCC"> semantics is here they'll</font>

88
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,120
recognize from their article<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

89
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,409
antivirus so if you over rely on your

90
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,009
antivirus you're doing yourself a

91
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:18,048
disservice antivirus is not dead it's by

92
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,060
no means<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead it's just it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't do</font>

93
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,738
the same thing it used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it used to</font>

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally be anti virus that would keep</font>

95
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,448
these Stone Age viruses off your

96
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,520
computer great perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> those don't exist</font>

97
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,969
anymore the stuff we deal with nowadays

98
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">is very complex and antivirus is more of</font>

99
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:38,330
a breach alerting system for malware

100
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,789
than anything out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 100 attacks with</font>

101
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,099
malware might stop one and that's only

102
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:44,110
because someone uploaded a sample to

103
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,800
virustotal or something

104
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,750
that Nara has a signature but don't rely

105
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,690
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your antivirus to prevent viruses</font>

106
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,880
anymore you need it it's an essential

107
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,400
layer of security you needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

108
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,950
when you're screwed is the basis of

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,560
antivirus so do yourself a service

110
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,870
having antivirus just don't look up to

111
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,650
drain work now our persistence

112
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,450
techniques so Mauer actually doesn't

113
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,979
want you to know it's on the computer

114
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,349
you probably won't know if mauer does

115
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,000
want you to be on the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if</font>

116
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,420
mauer does once you know it's on the

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,490
computer it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you know so</font>

118
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,410
cryptolocker that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

119
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,750
persistence technique it's in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> face</font>

120
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,610
persistence technique if it's more of a

121
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,850
targeted attack we might be talking

122
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,280
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PDF file that sleeps for a week</font>

123
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,800
on your HR directors computer and then

124
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,179
detonate and does nothing but what it

125
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,070
was supposed to do there's no

126
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,770
interaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the user you won't know</font>

127
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,640
it's there if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it's there</font>

128
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,090
how the hell are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to remediate</font>

129
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:49,630
it so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your antivirus probably didn't</font>

130
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,310
catch it um the third is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

131
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,900
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one though and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm</font>

132
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,210
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> today hopefully it's why you're</font>

133
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,570
here today lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of exposure and training</font>

134
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,640
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the big one so if your antivirus</font>

135
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,110
actually does detect something what are

136
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,020
you going to do about it call your

137
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,480
antivirus company what are they going to

138
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,400
do give you two free removals and charge

139
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,370
you for the third you have like a worm

140
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,979
outbreak on your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 nodes are</font>

141
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,170
infected you know there's only so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

142
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">B Company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do if it was a targeted</font>

143
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,810
attack they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get those</font>

144
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,090
samples and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put them</font>

145
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">into their AV repository and guess what</font>

146
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,530
there might actually be critical

147
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,110
information in those targeted attacks

148
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,010
directly related to your company and

149
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,480
then you get called out on Twitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

150
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,789
get some exposure in training<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's</font>

151
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,880
what we're going to go over here um so

152
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:42,970
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually three Mauer breach</font>

153
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:48,930
responses that make any sense first ones

154
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:51,040
nuke and pave second ones WTF ffffff and

155
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,620
third ones actually proper response

156
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,500
which all of you will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this talk</font>

157
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,430
right so the first one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

158
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go over is</font>

159
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,060
nuke and pave if how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,430
actually work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an IT department I</font>

161
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,620
figured you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys be here uh so you're</font>

162
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,030
probably used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this first one you're</font>

163
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,270
probably actually you might be required

164
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this first one it's quick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and easy</font>

165
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:19,870
it gets the job done and it gets Tom and

166
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,370
HR back to Tom and a chart he doesn't

167
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,890
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contend with the fake antivirus</font>

168
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,180
it keeps popping up you've just imaged

169
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,090
this machine with your corporate image

170
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,090
and call it a day right no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

171
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,799
right it is quick recovery but do you

172
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,390
have anyone in your organization that

173
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,250
actually knows how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle a piece of</font>

174
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:40,599
malware probably not um and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

175
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,000
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge corporations that</font>

176
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,980
have a sock some of you have security

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,470
administrator so you have better

178
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">security administrators and others but</font>

179
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,370
if you're going to do this and have this

180
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,610
as a policy at your company add another

181
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:57,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy on to it practice some lazy admin</font>

182
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,670
kung fu<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm not talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about Wutang</font>

183
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,260
so lazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and me kung Fu's it's simple the</font>

184
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,110
first technique is if you're going to

185
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,840
image the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box anyways copy image for</font>

186
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,690
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's windows 7 get an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> image</font>

187
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,760
of the MBR or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boot partition get</font>

188
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,580
an image<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the main system drive image</font>

189
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,460
that thing give it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Tom and then</font>

190
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,770
you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have yourself an organic</font>

191
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,810
infected image to play with if you don't

192
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,370
know malware you will in two weeks if

193
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,510
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> image over and</font>

194
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,910
over and over again image it on to

195
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,190
another machine you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

196
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,440
to actually have some huge analysis

197
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,140
Network to look at this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

198
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,100
linksys router physical machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a</font>

199
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,330
vm that's it so it do some lazy of man

200
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,820
kung fu because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to benefit</font>

201
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,590
you as well as your company hey what

202
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,480
happened oh you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just end mr.</font>

203
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,700
machine blah oh wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that image</font>

204
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,430
let me find out what happened let me see

205
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,860
if anyone exfiltrated data you know let

206
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">me see if something crazy happened or if</font>

207
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:01,390
they're still persisting on another node

208
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:03,310
in that office the second methodology is

209
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,410
one that really really pisses me<font color="#CCCCCC"> off and</font>

210
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,150
I've seen this situation so much it's

211
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not even a joke anymore it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

212
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,439
ridiculous um this is

213
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,079
the methodology where you really just do

214
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,050
nothing Barry was talking a little bit

215
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,399
about that earlier I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

216
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,109
many times I used to lead am our

217
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,710
response team we would get on people's

218
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:27,120
networks and if you look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

219
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,760
timestamps on the actual attack files

220
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,700
it's been there for months and this

221
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,660
isn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like grandma's chocolate shop</font>

222
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,180
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking like lawyers offices</font>

223
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,459
urgent cares any business you can think

224
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that's not a huge corporation that is</font>

225
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:47,469
a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> for malware it's probably going</font>

226
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get infected at some point but you</font>

227
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,810
have to be ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I found the</font>

228
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">majority of the people they get infected</font>

229
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,089
are ready to do nothing um so don't be

230
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,700
these people if you call<font color="#E5E5E5"> me up and you</font>

231
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:03,670
say hey Caleb um I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the smaller</font>

232
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,410
infection what should i do and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you</font>

233
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,899
how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been present and you tell</font>

234
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,270
me for months this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be my</font>

235
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,610
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you you've let this on your</font>

236
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,860
machine for four months how many nodes

are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network how many nodes are</font>

239
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,410
your employees passwords are set to

240
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,209
stupid things like password because you

241
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,650
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password policy and now</font>

242
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,529
you've just given them a pivot<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

243
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:30,000
into your network for months it's

244
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">ridiculous so there'll be these people</font>

245
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,410
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll find you so the third one I'd</font>

246
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,060
like to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the most</font>

247
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting when the most fun one and</font>

248
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,819
the most educational removal and

249
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,130
analysis coming from am our response

250

team<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rubo analysis is always the best</font>

251
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,000
way to go in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion even if you</font>

252
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,680
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to do it right away you</font>

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,560
know nuke and pave it image that machine

254
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,880
save the image but removal and analysis

255
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,770
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way to go if you're actually</font>

256
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

257
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,209
network if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to turn it</font>

258
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,010
over to the AV company if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find a</font>

259
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:05,979
benign sample maybe turn over to them

260
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,740
make them happy make them feel like

261
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,860
they're doing something but do it

262
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,750
yourself there's not a ton of tools out

263
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,490
there that actually cost money that you

264
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,630
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff with they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all free</font>

265
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,860
um so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> find an infection the first</font>

266
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,150
thing you should do is dump some damn

267
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,430
memory if you can't

268
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,060
the full memory dump which could be

269
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:31,550
upwards of eight gigs let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest</font>

270
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,770
some of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> have remote offices I my last</font>

you do there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are applications where you</font>

can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop them open and dump the</font>

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,530
help it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not help but you're doing</font>

285
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,260
your due diligence you're getting that

286
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,670
memory dump there might be you know five

287
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">bytes and that whole memory dump that</font>

288
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,459
even matter to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breach but you have</font>

289
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,680
those bites and no one else does they're

290
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,640
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right hands in other words so get</font>

291
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,890
a memory dump something a lot of people

292
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,460
don't consider with malware get a packet

293
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:31,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture 3060 minutes even if this Mauer</font>

294
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,190
is persisted on the machine for a week

who says<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not still communicating</font>

297
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:44,480
find the box that is infected and don't

298
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,430
install Wireshark on it please<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but</font>

299
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,610
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things malware does</font>

300
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,219
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> trip wires and I've seen</font>

301
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,560
malware trip wire and basically knock

302
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,050
out the nic card it completely erased it

303
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,640
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system if you have to do a</font>

304
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,709
system restore to fix your machine to

305
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,500
find the malware you're probably not

306
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:07,820
doing it right have a laptop be on the

307
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,590
same network and I run wireshark for an

308
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,300
hour get that peak out you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

309
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,780
get a whole lot of other traffic but

310
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,760
guess what why are shortcuts filters you

311
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,770
can do follow carving with wireshark or

312
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,110
you can do file covering with<font color="#CCCCCC"> P cats so</font>

313
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:24,170
get that pcap if it's exfiltrating files

314
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,570
run something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view familiar with</font>

315
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,930

316
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,730
utilities run it against it you may have

317
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,739
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel spreadsheets popping out of</font>

with your system you know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> G all my</font>

339
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:27,170
dealing with malware directly for so

340
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,030
long I have this mental<font color="#CCCCCC"> list that I go</font>

341
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,890
down every time I get on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a machine that</font>

342
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,020
might be infected or it has some kind of

343
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,400
thing wrong with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and immediately I</font>

344
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,100
start looking in these places like

345
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,530
program data you know get all the files

346
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,230
and folders that are hidden out in the

347
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,670
open just turn all that stuff off get

348
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything visible look in these</font>

349
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,949
directories you may see Microsoft spell

350
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,750
20 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in program data or something</font>

351
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,910
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look inside</font>

352
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,160
that Microsoft directory inside program

353
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:58,640
data they do all kind of little tricks

354
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,260
basically to hide and persist but you

355
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,900
wouldn't know about these unless you

356
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,910
look for them and when you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them</font>

357
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,100
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually find more places that they</font>

358
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,980
hide there's a trick that they use

359
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,750
basically where they make directories on

360
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,950
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the recycle bin and they push</font>

361
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:18,020
their files into that file been there

362
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,190
the file the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recycle bin is not a</font>

363
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:24,410
directory it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a weird thing</font>

364
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Windows has to get rid of files but</font>

365
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,790
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it through the</font>

366
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,290
proper<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a directory and you</font>

367
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,780
can get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> other directories that are</font>

368
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind that directory and it's a popular</font>

369
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,459
place to store files that you don't want

370
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,440
the owner to know or on the machine same

371
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,230
with some fivesome directories in the

372
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:47,180
windows directory like um

373
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:49,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">their shortcut files basically and a</font>

374
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,349
virus called zero access was actually

375
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">using one of these shortcuts and</font>

376
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,710
leveraging it as a directory so if you

377
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,240
went in it with Windows Windows 7

378
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,870
especially because it had to make all

379
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,970
those shortcuts to meld with how the XP

380
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,910
file structure was set up you click on

381
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,100
it oh sorry this is in the directory but

382
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you actually open a tool and look at</font>

383
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">it you go through it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a directory</font>

384
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,910
and all the files related to this virus

385
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,890
are stored<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> directory so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> manual</font>

386
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:21,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">mauer extraction very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

387
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:23,550
plus you want that sample the fourth one

388
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,860
is have some kind of analysis

389
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:29,069
environment so like I was saying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font>

390
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,320
dell machines in a linksys router what

391
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,450
you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have though is some</font>

392
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,260
kind of automated sandbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup now</font>

393
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:40,440
everyone says sandbox it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font>

394
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">apt word um a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to drink I would</font>

395
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,260
drink for saying that so sandbox is it's

396
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,380
not super critical but it's super

397
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,450
essential so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what</font>

398
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened right away you find executable</font>

399
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,520
you've extracted off machine on your

400
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:59,280
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could go through manual</font>

401
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,350
analysis for hours and not find a whole

402
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,500
lot you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw it in the sandbox you</font>

403
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,360
could have a sandbox client set up to

404
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,010
look like your HR departments image you

405
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">could have one set up for your IT</font>

406
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,190
departments image finance they all run

407
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,110
different software for different things

408
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,210
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your finance department might</font>

409
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:17,569
run QuickBooks have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> image with</font>

410
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:20,819
QuickBooks on their populated

411
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,859
generically to some degree push this

412
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,899
piece of our at it see if it goes after

413
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,790
it especially if you're dealing with a

414
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,100
PDF<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent to your finance</font>

415
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:31,590
department have that image ready throw

416
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,000
it in the sandbox it may obviate itself

417
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,709
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit because it sees its own a</font>

418
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,040
vm or something but guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's</font>

419
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:41,010
better than nothing and most sandbox is

420
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,440
available free ones and pay ones have a

421
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:46,440
pcap feature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will log all the</font>

422
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,780
outgoing and incoming data while that

423
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,310
sample is running it'll print<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a</font>

424
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,080
really nice report that you could

425
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,429
probably show to your manager that<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

426
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,699
what the hell happened on<font color="#E5E5E5"> his network as</font>

427
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,490
well so battle planning

428
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:04,020
now if your organization has a policy

429
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,550
for a malware breach great but there's a

430
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,440
lot of companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even have</font>

431
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,600
one sentence place let alone one word

432
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,880
well they do have two words in place oh

433
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,790
 is there malware breach response

434
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,980
basically so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going to do if</font>

435
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,960
you work say you work at urgent care or

436
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,780
a doctor's office it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge one</font>

437
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,610
I've actually experienced this with a

438
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,389
doctor's office<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font>

439
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,429
state or the city but their terminal

440
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:33,150
server kept getting infected how do you

441
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:37,470
infect a server you executed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you</font>

442
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,940
execute a file directly on it these the

443
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,490
server kept getting infected I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had no</font>

444
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,710
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> why until I realized one day that</font>

445
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:48,210
all the nurses walked around with those

446
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:50,100
HP tablets and the nurses had no clue

447
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,960
that every time they logged into that

448
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,600
tablet it was terminal services go into

449
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,070
the server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 nurses</font>

450
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,990
basically surfing the internet from

451
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:02,460
these tablets through terminal services

452
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:07,140
the servers also where they keep all

453
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,480
their medical data there's no breachers

454
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,980
their brief response plan was to call me

455
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:17,430
and they're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to call</font>

456
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,350
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> again because I I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of gave them a</font>

457
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,240
tongue beating a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about not</font>

458
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,219
having any breach response plan in place

459
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,860
and this is some years ago so provide

460
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,990
training to your people or someone or

461
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,120
someone if you have an IT department you

462
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,590
don't have a security administrator go

463
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,929
to your IT department one day and say

464
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,669

knows how to touch malware and don't be

487
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:33,748
shocked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer they'll prolly say</font>

490
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,939
someone come on site to format that

491
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:45,419
machine even<font color="#E5E5E5"> small like computer repair</font>

492
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,970
shops thats a virus removal they they

493
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,169
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer virus removal they offer</font>

494
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,859
formatting basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a hundred</font>

495
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:57,059
dollars a pop so also have multiple

496
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:59,609
response solution set up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

497
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:02,039
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it were merly er worms are</font>

498
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:04,619
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very intense things on your network</font>

499
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,908
if there's a worm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network more</font>

500
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,699
likely everything is going to be running

501
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,529
slow not just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you're</font>

502
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,669
copying a file to the computer next to

503
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,070
you on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network it's going to be</font>

504
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:16,649
running slow worms don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care worms</font>

505
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,149
basically go nuts they try excellent

506
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:20,908
rate as much data as they can as

507
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:23,488
aggressively as they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> noda node node</font>

508
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:25,109
and they they could really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care less if</font>

509
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:26,369
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them and they persist really</font>

510
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:30,029
well especially if you have shared

511
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:33,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">network drives have a worm breach</font>

512
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:34,799
response in place network breach if you

513
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,480
have more than one machine infected on

514
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,239
your network you're probably dealing

515
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a worm or some kind of target</font>

attack have a single node breach

517
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:47,879
response plan in place you know step<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

518
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,439
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the computer off everyone's</font>

519
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:52,199
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> taught that don't turn the computer</font>

520
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,389
off you're killing that infection you're

521
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,059
making that infection aware they well

522
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:59,549
we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it don't terminate the</font>

523
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,139
network connection if you terminate the

524
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,899
network connection and then plug it back

525
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:05,340
in an hour later I deem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

526
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:08,189
suspicious if I was controlling your

527
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,439
computer you know you know just reboot

528
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,429
midday all of a sudden things are

529
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,869
different after you boot back up nah you

530
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:18,299
don't want to set off alarms because

531
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:21,779
some malware authors really don't care

532
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:23,650
about you hence<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptolocker and have a</font>

533
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,680
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for false positives in place</font>

534
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:30,280
not many people touch on false positives

535
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:33,580
if alarm bells on your network are going

536
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,899
off like crazy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should actually look</font>

537
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and see what's making them go off so if</font>

538
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,820
notepad is being flagged on every

539
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,719
machine in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire organization</font>

540
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,480
there's a good chance it's false

541
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,190
positive not many malware authors go

542
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,570
after notepad but it's a fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font>

543
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:55,120
talk about upload that notepad dot exe

544
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,889
de virustotal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

545
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,929
at length about virustotal because

546
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,270
Google owns them for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

547
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,160
don't know every time you upload a

548
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,440
sample virustotal<font color="#E5E5E5"> their monetizing your</font>

549
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,750
data is it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great service hell yeah</font>

550
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,700
it's great service<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use it but if</font>

551
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,160
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upload a targeted attack</font>

552
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,390
that hit your organization I really

553
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,910
wouldn't recommend it because you're

554
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:20,200
sending it to google google is selling

555
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:22,270
it to whoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> third pays for the API key</font>

556
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,380
so have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> false positive playing in</font>

557
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,780
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's other things other than</font>

558
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,720
virustotal there's jadi bunch other

559
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,430
stuff a sandbox a small sandbox

560
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,590
environment could tell you it was if

561
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,230
it's a false positive throw notepad.exe

562
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:38,350
at your array detonate it on every

563
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,300
machine it's not doing anything boom

564
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,189
you've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> proven it's a false positive</font>

565
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,680
without calling your AV company

566
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,440
uploading it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and wearing</font>

567
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,220
your boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh got this handled false</font>

568
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,220
positive verified here's a report sweet

569
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,680
go back to sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your desk so</font>

570
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:00,400
obviously have multiple defense methods

571
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:03,610
in place AV perimeter devices anything

572
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,670
you could think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of um just because you</font>

573
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:08,169
have AV like I said you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not safe you</font>

574
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:12,070
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perimeter</font>

575
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:14,320
that's filtering in some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or</font>

576
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,909
form I mean some people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have</font>

577
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,310
filtering on their email turned on they

578
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use a spam email box like it's some</font>

579
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:24,159
kind of malware filters or something

580
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:25,810
like that it's not not only have defense

581
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,940
methods in place but make sure

582
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone's aware of them they actually</font>

583
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">have something to do with them</font>

584
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,340
there was an incident yesterday at my

585
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,750
job where there's a server and no one

586
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">could find it well it was off but the</font>

587
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,580
proper person didn't know that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

588
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,559
been turned off or rather not turned

589
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,050
back on because it wasn't on the UPS yet

590
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,520
by everyone that needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know didn't</font>

591
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so we couldn't find that server for</font>

592
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,920
like an hour then well it's called owing

593
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:59,380
someone a beer so also<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit your damn</font>

594
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,300
network how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> java</font>

595
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:05,500
running on your network right now Java

596
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:10,659
Runtime environment don't don't

597
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:14,460
me raise your hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay why do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

598
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,460
java installed on your network at all

599
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,790
now there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of crappy legacy apps</font>

600
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,559
that use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java unfortunately there's a</font>

601
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,670
lot of companies it won't upgrade that

602
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:29,110
software because it runs I understand

603
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,390
there are circumstances where you

604
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,610
actually have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have java installed so</font>

605
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:37,660
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parenthesis at the</font>

606
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:39,760
bottom but yeah if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it how</font>

607
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:44,679
many of you have to have flash installed

608
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:49,150
on the nodes that your work half to four

609
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,980
work I didn't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and I know you're</font>

610
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,710
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not cheeky like not raising your</font>

611
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,480
hand none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need flash</font>

612
00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:03,250
installed on the nodes at your office

613
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:07,059
would you agree with that if there's is

614
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:12,820
there any marketing people here there

615
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:15,780
you go yeah so html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> too um but yeah</font>

616
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,550
flash<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java you're gonna have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

617
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,190
there's no way getting around it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

618
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,780
i run a vm just to run java for some

619
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,530
stupid application off to run sometimes

620
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:30,940
it's I mean it's mindless but it's

621
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:32,260
needed flash good luck I mean if you

622
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,309
don't need flash on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network I</font>

623
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,559
understand you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disrupt</font>

624
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:38,710
everyone's lunch hour but like do

625
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,350
something get rid of it like you do

626
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop it audit your people</font>

627
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,760
see how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them actually need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

628
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:49,940
I mean it could make productivity go up

629
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,230
or down granted but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just make</font>

630
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,000
sure you know what's on your network if

631
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,130
you're running five different versions

632
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,850
of flash that's a problem if you're on

633
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the latest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much of a problem</font>

634
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:04,010
so all your network and don't install

635
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in you know by all means if she</font>

636
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open the jar don't tell her to</font>

637
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,490
install Java<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the trade</font>

638
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,280
and this is probably one of the more

639
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:20,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the talk i</font>

640
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:22,940
misspelled trade my bed so find and

641
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,260
identify the malware how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font>

642
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,450
well first off windows explorer it

643
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,680
literally tells you what it's what

644
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,110
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing exploring</font>

645
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,900
Windows Windows Explorer that's utility

646
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:39,740
Microsoft ever made actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> um don't</font>

647
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:42,500
quote me on that my seek was or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ms</font>

648
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,960
sequel was up there with a show um

649
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:50,420
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> process explorer how many of you</font>

650
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:54,140
heard of sysinternals yeah that makes me

651
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:56,390
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy so process explorer is what</font>

652
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">tasks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always been but</font>

653
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft didn't see it that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

654
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,040
they didn't even code sysinternals they

655
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,490
bought off with<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone i'm pretty</font>

656
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,830
pretty sure so process explorer is task

657
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,450
manager on steroids you can do a lot you

658
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,280
can look really<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep into the system the</font>

659
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have here on the screen</font>

660
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,410
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single individual</font>

661
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,020
process don't because I don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

662
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:21,170
transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight gigs over the network</font>

663
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:25,010
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> also shows is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

664
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:27,620
execution tree of what's going on what

665
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:31,879
what is executing white basically so if

666
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:34,639
you see CSRs SDXC executing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I explore</font>

667
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,520
dot exe obviously something's wrong if

668
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,350
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this stuff long enough over</font>

669
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,350
and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you're going to</font>

670
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,570
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pop this open immediately say</font>

671
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:48,409
why is explored out exe using like to

672
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:50,330
megs of memory um immediately and then

673
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,460
you're going to start basically looking

674
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,620
into explorer.exe looking what it took

675
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,600
tin to what's hooked into it anything

676
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that but you won't know unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

677
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,000
look and

678
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,760
you can't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually have</font>

679
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,260
the right tools to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look something else</font>

680
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with this which I found</font>

681
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,120
really interesting especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

682
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,730
access was around you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do a</font>

683
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,280
handle search in a dll search to see

684
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,560
what's hooked into what so the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

685
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,770
have here is in that symbol why would i

686
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,560
look for something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

687
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,060
access when it first came out used the

688
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,879
shortcut directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was describing</font>

689
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,879
earlier in the windows directory one of

690
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,930
the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it dropped wasn't that</font>

691
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,120
simple I don't know why maybe just lazy

692
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:38,660
fat fingering from the initial developer

693
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,979
but it was an @ symbol so when we start

694
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system we actually</font>

695
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,440
found that that @ symbol was hooked into

696
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,720
services dot exe hooked in the system it

697
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,220
was hooked into everything critical that

698
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,520
if you shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

699
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:55,190
just crash how do you remove that well

700
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:58,580
you have to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we found it so</font>

701
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:02,960
we basically rebooted to utility disk

702
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:04,790
did some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sometimes you you have</font>

703
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,830
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a follow replacement or something</font>

704
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,750
like that but you won't know unless you

705
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">look you wouldn't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this @ symbol is</font>

706
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,850
hooked into like 15 different

707
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,980
applications on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine so the</font>

708
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:18,320
third part is the properties dialog for

709
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,630
process explorer it's the best

710
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,419
properties dialog for any running

711
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:26,510
application ever and this is actually

712
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:29,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the upgraded version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they came</font>

713
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,760
out with it may have came out with a new

714
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,820
process explorer<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide</font>

715
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,220
but I can guarantee you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> properties</font>

716
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,350
page does look the same so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just</font>

717
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:43,670
from the properties dialog you can do so

718
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:48,110
much if you notice the strings over on

719
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:51,110
the on the right side so how many of you

720
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:53,840
know what strings are and not the kind

721
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,580
that tie your shoe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it strings are</font>

722
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,120
basically just a ski strings within

723
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,699
anything so Linux has strings command

724
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">built-in because it's linux windows</font>

725
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,530
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sysinternals has it but if you</font>

726
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,660
run strings against an executable it's

727
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:11,270
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to drop out every single</font>

728
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ASCII readable character or string in</font>

729
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,310
there

730
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,620
sometimes you'll see the original path

731
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,990
that the Mauer author was using to

732
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,530
develop them our but the actual

733
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,730
directories will be obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> gated</font>

734
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:27,030
sometimes you'll see website I've found

735
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,400
malware sites I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just malware</font>

736
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,960
hotspot sites where everyone uploads

737
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,440
their stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions on how to</font>

738
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,600
make malware better in the strings I

739
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,400
found quotes for pulp fiction in the

740
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,050
strings for malware before you find the

741
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:45,330
weirdest in some of these strings

742
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:48,419
um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nadia virus do you remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

743
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,980
Nadia the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy the strings inside they</font>

744
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,860
named it based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the strings inside the</font>

745
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,870
virus it's some singer I think some

746
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,000
bollywood singer or something but he

747
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,770
literally put i love i love you need dia

748
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,570
all through the strings and this Mauer

749
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,600
executable like she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to know</font>

750
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:06,649
bro sorry something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

751
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,350
you can actually directly send the hash

752
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:14,880
for this executable q virustotal so if

753
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:17,629
you submit it it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to upload the</font>

754
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,190
hash it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to upload the file</font>

755
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,680
something safe to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> virus total is</font>

756
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,690
look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hash they don't know what</font>

757
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,130
that hash is they may store that hash

758
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,840
good for them but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

759
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,900
executable it's related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to or whatever</font>

760
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,209
file that you're uploading so a lot of

761
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,270
sandbox is actually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a virus</font>

762
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:39,360
total kind of module for them they just

763
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:42,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">do a hash check um if you are familiar</font>

764
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:47,280
with the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit add-on um</font>

765
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:50,250
slipped my mind I written<font color="#E5E5E5"> by harm joy</font>

766
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,290
and but anyways<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's is to create</font>

767
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,360
payload to get by AV and they have a

768
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,590
module built in basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they</font>

769
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,949
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you uploading their payloads</font>

770
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:03,330
to virustotal so they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> built a</font>

771
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:05,790
hash checker into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can't</font>

772
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,620
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of it I will do so</font>

773
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:10,350
dump some damn memory dump all the

774
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:14,219
memory very small application just

775
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:16,620
standard exe and it all it does is just

776
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,870
memory dump and a lot of malware

777
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,020
actually will listen for various tools

778
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:24,090
like process explorer I've not had that

779
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,720
happen with dump it I mean there's a ton

780
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,000
of other utilities you can use

781
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,670
memory dump<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just one if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

782
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do a kind of quick and dirty</font>

783
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,290
memory dumps use something like this it

784
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't have to be this it's just fun</font>

785
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:41,860
because it's called dump it so the third

786
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,080
toll I'm going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

787
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,610
I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about 12 minutes left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

788
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,780
one actually going to get most<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-depth</font>

789
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:52,649
about so I pc hunter AKA Zooter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

790
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,480
not pronouncing that correctly at all um

791
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,510
this is a tool i found so another thing

792
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to preach is find more tools</font>

793
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:04,240
find all the tools evaluate them pick

794
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:07,149
the best ones out and use them we we ran

795
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,130
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of malware that actually was</font>

796
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:12,520
sitting at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the carnival listening for</font>

797
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:14,290
tools common tools I penguins familiar

798
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,440
with tdss killer built by kaspersky

799
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:19,659
great rootkit removal tool very very

800
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,340
common rootkit removal tool especially

801
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,649
to malware authors we've had situations

802
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:27,430
where we've started a process explorer

803
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:29,080
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an infected machine or any of our</font>

804
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:33,489
common applications especially

805
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,469
sysinternals and these clothes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

806
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,239
you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> open them again and the</font>

807
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:40,600
permissions the run permissions are gone

808
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,669
I mean it's literally tripwire it's

809
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,520
literally sitting there saying nah not

810
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:48,970
today um so we had to actually find

811
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,509
other tools to either stop it from doing

812
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:55,000
that or to get around it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

813
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">research i found this tool i did a lot</font>

814
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,750
of research to find this tool this tool

815
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,120
if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website it's just a zoo</font>

816
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:04,510
com / download just make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to /</font>

817
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,810
download the entire sites mandarin this

818
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:11,890
is a tool coated in on mainland<font color="#E5E5E5"> china by</font>

819
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:15,040
a guy i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think his name's actually</font>

820
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,839
Zooter but whoever he is he did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

821
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,430
great job with this tool this tool you

822
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,740
can look directly to kernel modules you

823
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:25,029
can look directly into ring 0 and ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

824
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:27,580
it I understand how this tool is even

825
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:31,120
available for free actually he did make

826
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:33,310
a paid version but you know you got to

827
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,230
monetize somehow so there are several

828
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,910
several things you can do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

829
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,660
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could stay in here five more</font>

830
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:42,200
hours and tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this but um</font>

831
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,730
other stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do with this tool is</font>

832
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you can see if an application</font>

833
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:51,020
has ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 access you can see what's</font>

834
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:55,099
hooked into it there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

835
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:58,500
process explorer on steroids almost so

836
00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:00,150
quick and dirty if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need as much</font>

837
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,440
information off the machine as possible

838
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,329
you need to get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for some</font>

839
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,730
reason it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has an examination</font>

840
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:08,369
report that as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see will list all</font>

841
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:12,299
kernel modules processes eggs cooked and

842
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:14,250
everything of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature the reason I'm</font>

843
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:17,520
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this tool specifically in</font>

844
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:21,150
relation to malware basically nullifying

845
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,309
our tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove it is we</font>

846
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,680
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

847
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:27,500
kernel modules I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think actually we're</font>

848
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,788
looking at the colonel callbacks so

849
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,640
everything suspicious shows up in red

850
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:34,890
all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ran process explorer</font>

851
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,569
it got nullified we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of a</font>

852
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,990
sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hey there's a line and read</font>

853
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:44,759
what happens if we delete it Oh process

854
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:47,459
explorer runs perfect um so a word of

855
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:52,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">warning this tool is excellent it's</font>

856
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,400
super sweet but every tool that you come

857
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,010
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've never used before</font>

858
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,099
trait like<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace malware because it</font>

859
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,539
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a really good idea to build</font>

860
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,930
malware that looks like now removal

861
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:07,829
tools this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of our this</font>

862
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:11,069
does nothing malicious but but um when

863
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:14,099
you run this it calls out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> China like</font>

864
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:15,599
three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye peas and depending on</font>

865
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,490
actually what version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this you're</font>

866
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,730
running this is PC hundred sixty

867
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:22,200
four-bit used to be called suitor um

868
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,960
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the free version if you run the</font>

869
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,078
the paid version it connects to even

870
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,180
more IPS in China like Chinese IP blocks

871
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,029
period it's not just connecting to some

872
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:37,410
random CN like these are static IPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

873
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:41,160
connecting to quite literally so it's

874
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:46,170
it's purely for registration type stuff

875
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:48,960
but who knows I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> ax asked at Carolina</font>

876
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:52,260
con basically what if it was using like

877
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,390
DNS transmission methods

878
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:58,810
well great if you don't trust it don't

879
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:01,330
use it but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying if you do</font>

880
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:05,380
find tools like this out on the web test

881
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:08,770
them first you know run wireshark open

882
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:15,630
it see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it connects to um actually</font>

883
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:23,860
another tool talk about real quick is a

884
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:25,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp view TCV view is kind of a GUI</font>

885
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,720
netstat that does a lot more interactive

886
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-time um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use this to find worms</font>

887
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,339
immediately if if there's a warm on the

888
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:36,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">box it's making tons of outbound</font>

889
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:40,150

890
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:43,810
shows up in green every connection that

891
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:46,240
gets disconnected turns red when you see

895
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,940
crazy it's connecting that literally

896
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,650
everything it can another time that you

897
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,200
will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of activity though is</font>

898
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:02,110
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a if you're an ode on a</font>

been taken over so TCP view off the bat

905
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,240
see what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it tells you</font>

906
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:21,460
what executable it's originating from

907
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,580
boom oh this is infected we should do

908
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:28,900
something but you wouldn't know unless

909
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:34,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked um and this is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

910
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,560
tool um so

911
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,380
interesting I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have probably</font>

912
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,560
infected this vm but it probably would

913
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,120
have infected my powerpoint also

914
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,250
something else if you'll notice if you

915
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:49,089
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top left side of the corner</font>

916
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:51,370
um the it doesn't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC hunter or</font>

917
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:53,980
Zooter something else about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool I</font>

918
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:56,529
found really neat<font color="#E5E5E5"> eh it drops its own</font>

919
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,290
driver be itself obvious gates upon

920
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,940
execution so there's another tool that

921
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,980
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of does this called G mer but it</font>

922
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,740
does it with the actual file name this

923
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,180
every time you run it new string

924
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,950
completely different what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

925
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,250
prevent the malware from shutting it

926
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:14,799
down it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it um and also has a</font>

927
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:21,040
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mandarin in it so it was kind of</font>

928
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:23,740
rough for me too so<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a deeper look</font>

929
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,509
with sketchy tools just make sure

930
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,950
they're not sketchy or they're sketchy

931
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,950
to a level that you're comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

932
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:36,520
yeah don't download any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

933
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:38,470
from sourceforge please so other tools

934
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,259
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for these</font>

935
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,879
situations some some of these tools you

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,130
may have heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some you may have not</font>

937
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,140
of some you're like how how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does this</font>

938
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,390
deal with malware how would this

939
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,029
actually work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an infection on my</font>

just three tools there's like 30 40 I

948
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:19,060
just went over process explorer because

949
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:21,970
it's more general purpose of any tool in

950
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:24,029
there so any user could open it up and

951
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,169
actually kind of see what's going on

952
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,060

you will go into directories that like

features like delete and lock or delete

awesome little rough to set up but after

980
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,649
you get it set up very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> pristine</font>

981

right side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the screen pretty much is</font>

983
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,500
just utilities that you can boot to so

REM<font color="#CCCCCC"> knucks obviously is anyone heard of</font>

00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,780
helix do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any forensic cousin</font>

986
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:56,770
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay uh helix is more of kind of a</font>

987
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:59,080
forensic installation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as a</font>

988
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:02,440
lot of tools on so put it up see what it

989
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:06,310
does use some stuff on it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

990
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,650
beer so depth depth is actually similar

991
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:11,110
to helix um the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually found</font>

992
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:14,100
depth on my tool hunt was because I was

993
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to actually extract data from a</font>

hfs+ drive or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and</font>

995
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,190
helix and I think I tried another when

996
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,470
they just they couldn't actually look at

997
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data def had the correct drivers</font>

00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:29,470
just booted up pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data off and</font>

999
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:33,790
call it a day hirens bootcd how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1000
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:36,669
you heard of hirens sweet so that's

1001
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:39,490
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important picture on</font>

1002
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,260
here so hirens bootcd it's slightly

1003
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,970
illegal because it has a modified

1004
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,250
version of windows XP on it which is

1005
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:47,049
awesome by the way when you boot to it

1006
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,390
you can either literally boot into

1007
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows XP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a mini windows XP that</font>

1008
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,830
actually there's a wim file you can

1009
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,170
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> edit and you can customize this</font>

1010
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:58,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">iso to whatever you want you can boot</font>

1011
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:01,960
into linux which is parted parted magic

1012
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,430
part of linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe um</font>

1013
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,839
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tons and tons and tons of</font>

1014
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,868
tools I don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> version you get</font>

1015
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,490
it might have norton ghost on it ah a

1016
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:12,369
semantic people you didn't hear that

1017
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:15,098
from me so hirens bootcd is great

1018
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:17,140
because it's 500 megs it's an iso you

1019
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:20,740
can customize it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got mine down to 100</font>

1020
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,810
megs why is that important if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1021
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,009
an organization where you're probably

1022
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,720
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an hour breach you have</font>

1023
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:27,790
multiple offices all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font>

1024
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,830
would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice just to have a response</font>

1025
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">I so that that office could download and</font>

1026
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:35,619
burn real quick boot it up I actually

1027
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:38,380
even got this to auto fire up the

1028
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:39,940
network drivers and start teamviewer if

1029
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,670
there's a version of teamviewer included

1030
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:46,180
on it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have someone</font>

1031
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,310
boot to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disk in San Diego I could</font>

1032
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,009
remote into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the booted disk and I could</font>

1033
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:52,299
actually look<font color="#CCCCCC"> into their system and</font>

1034
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,240
remove the virus or do whatever was

1035
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,830
needed and that was the hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg disk</font>

1038
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,819
there's a lot of stuff on there I think

1039
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,720
they even have a version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of malwarebytes</font>

1040
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:10,390
on there but yeah who does that um but

1041
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,279
anyways highly customizable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd highly</font>

1042
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,759

1045
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,819
these tools if you play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1046
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:27,009
you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do yourself a huge favor</font>
