important for us not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only to create</font>

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,910
those jobs but also to deal with the

the place that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bay that but</font>

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,299
obviously one of my other huge obviously

75
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,910
is governor keeping networks and data

76
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,270
and information safe is critically

77
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,420
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any government any company</font>

78
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> academy's all over the globe</font>

competing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> jobs and economic activity</font>

81
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,310
is something that why we say we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,800
parent I understand this and as governor

109
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,660
I really do the consequences<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

110
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,670
breaches go well beyond economic and

111
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,440
privacy concerns they threaten the

112
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,620
safety of our citizens in the national

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,670
companies that are somehow closely

125
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,140
aligned in that ecosystem we have a

126
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,580
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we're doing</font>

everything we can to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody safe</font>

128
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,469
because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep these businesses</font>

129
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:39,250
here in 2014 Virginia experienced more

130
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,610
than 100,000 attack attempts per day and

131
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,790
we stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year 271 million spam</font>

132
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,500
messages so as I say as governor I'm

133
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,060
ultimately responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensuring the</font>

we launched what we call our Virginia

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,770
cyber initiative I appointed our great

secretary of Technology Karen Jackson

152
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,530
and also the co-chair of that is Richard

153
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,540
Clark as you know worked the last three

167
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,380
in fact since I took office our

168
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,510
Commonwealth has achieved three first in

169
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,750
the nation in the area of cyber security

170
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,580
in February of last year Virginia became

171
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,190
the first state in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation to adopt</font>

172

the National Institute of Standards and

175
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,780
suit after we took the lead earlier this

176
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,990
spring we became<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first state to form</font>

177
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,900
an information sharing and analysis

178
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,700
organization I saw so that we can better

179
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,400
share information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity</font>

181
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,469
sectors and we were just the first state

182
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,170
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country to host a state-led</font>

payment security and consumer protection

185
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:52,180
and during the last legislative session

186
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,480
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very active and helped pass and</font>

187
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,040
sign six pieces of legislation that

188
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,840
originated with the cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> commission to</font>

189
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,150
strengthen our systems and ensure

190
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,919
encourage growth i would say that each

191
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,929
of these achievements is a reflection of

192
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,870
the commitment of this commonwealth to

193
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,120
leading the way forward when it comes to

194
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,280
building our public and private networks

<font color="#E5E5E5">have very low taxes here one of the</font>

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,290
our unique relationship close to

217
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,910
Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC to really build it to the</font>

218
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,880
next level as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the White House</font>

219
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:13,030
has announced that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want to build</font>

220
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,640
we call a cyber campus to take military

221
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:18,520
defense related assets from various

222
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,090
agencies combined them and put them in

223
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,040
one state so as you can imagine there is

224
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,350
really only one state the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House</font>

225
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,209
should put that the Commonwealth of

226
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,070
Virginia so we are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

227
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,470
aggressively to make sure that Congress

228
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,520
keeps that funding in but if we can pull

229
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,230
this off and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working very hard to</font>

230
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,750
the president the united states now runs

231
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,150
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he sees me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming that's every time</font>

233
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,260
president but just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks what we</font>

234
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,210
could do think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ecosystem we could</font>

235
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,620
build around that to have that placed

236
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,030
here and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> region</font>

237
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,890
obviously because of all the defense

238
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,420
military assets so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to we're</font>

258
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,859
happens automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> congress now has</font>

259
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,210
to vote to stop it and i have you can

260
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,400
tell me what this Congress is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

261

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,520
goes into full effect really will impact
