1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,240
good morning everyone can everyone hear

2
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,460
me just<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the back my name is</font>

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,159
Jason Smith that's a pleasure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here</font>

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">today you talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we're going</font>

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk a little more about history</font>

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,130
especially based on the keynote you know

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,890
we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how things are kind of</font>

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,320
old within 18 months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,020
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your toes but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,780
historically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know maybe we're</font>

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,250
never well adopted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give some</font>

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,740
stats on this here in a minute but

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,940
you'll and you'll see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean but</font>

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,790
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about network flow</font>

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,809
data and I'm going to kind of introduce

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,579
this na here's how to you know collect

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,160
it here are some tools to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

18
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:05,860
specifically as silk which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was developed</font>

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carnegie Mellon as well as flow</font>

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,590
plotter a tool that takes silk data and

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,720
makes it in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting plots and</font>

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,750
as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow back which is a tool</font>

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:20,200
that Chris Sanders and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed to</font>

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,420
kind of ease silk users into flow data

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,030
more easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot of</font>

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">barricades the entry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've tried to</font>

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">overcome and hopefully you'll see you</font>

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,180
know here at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in 10</font>

29
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,490
minutes if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> already have a flow</font>

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,280
solution set up in 10-15 minutes

31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,839
regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your enterprise and very</font>

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,740
little configuration you can have a

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,540
fully qualified flow solution so just

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,270
out of curiosity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I know</font>

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,939
based on the previous hands up maybe

36
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,250
there's some sháá but who here is with

37
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:56,070
like a net ops group or a security

38
00:01:51,250 --> 00:02:01,979
operations group with defense okay and

39
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:04,960
who uses a flow solution already<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

40
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,410
few and well what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go over</font>

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,709
are a few different flow solutions

42
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:14,380
namely things you can gather and and

43
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:17,079
deploy with relative ease but especially

44
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,790
again I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over silk and as</font>

45
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:21,730
long as some scripts that will aid and

46
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,620
actually setting that up so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is</font>

47
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,410
Jason Smith<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not drive here from</font>

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,750
down the road

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,329
as it seems almost a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I've</font>

50
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,110
met or you know they're the driving

51
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,730
distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I flew in here from Kentucky</font>

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm born and raised<font color="#CCCCCC"> there but I have</font>

53
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:41,420
been kind of all over the place working

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">for state and federal agencies and then</font>

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,350
moving on to mandiant which was then

56
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:51,530
acquired by fire with fire i'm part of

57
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:54,560
the threat analytics platform group<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

58
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,480
work on making some rules with probably

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,280
you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best bunch of people</font>

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,130
I've ever worked with me there they're

61
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">great guys never gives us any problems</font>

62
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:06,260
you see here it's basically a death trap

63
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,770
it's cara built with a buddy of mine

64
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,380
which now is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this raspberry pi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Suzy</font>

65
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,950
azum I have is a war driving and more

66
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,930
dune buggy it's a pretty fun car but

67
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,570
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a junkyard engineer on the</font>

68
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,120
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> I throw together a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,060
cars into one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make a Mad Max type</font>

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,380
vehicle and drive it on the road and son

71
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,240
time in Kentucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to get</font>

72
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,380
things checked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for missions so it's</font>

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:36,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place here's shameless plug for</font>

74
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,959
applied network security monitoring i

75
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,958
will go to too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much into what this is a</font>

76
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,970
lot of priority know about it actually

77
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">David Bianco's here as well he helped</font>

78
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,609
write as well but all proceeds to plot

79
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,640
number of security monitoring for the

80
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">authors go to charities such as rule</font>

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology fund hackers for charity</font>

82
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,380
several different other charities

83
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,989
essentially you know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

84
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,510
chapters<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the book dedicated to flow</font>

85
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,110
analysis dedicated to how to set stuff

86
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,700
up and how to use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tech bad guys</font>

87
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,040
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even since this book was published</font>

88
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,988
you know most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work for flow</font>

89
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,399
plotter and flow bat they kind of came

90
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,350
afterwards when we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it</font>

91
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,269
saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we reread this</font>

92
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,980
thing and it's still kind of difficult

93
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,740
there's still a pretty large barrier to

94
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,570
entry but now you know do this talk I'll

95
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,400
give you six commands that will will

96
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,409
erase all of that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it will make it</font>

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,299
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you know you can you know jump</font>

98
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,580
into this book and any examples without

99
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,430
any you know prerequisite setups that

100
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,690
you have to do

101
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,300
there's no no work behind it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

102
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,840
again several chapters go into it you

103
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,700
can follow along pretty easily so

104
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,469
today's agenda is all about flow data

105
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,120
it's obviously I'm gonna tell you it's

106
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">very important though and approved it is</font>

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,160
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> important as well show you</font>

108
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,230
how easily it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this to not</font>

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,770
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get answers but get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

110
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,300
answers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> significantly less time than</font>

111
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,299
you would who did not have flow data

112
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,370
available you know how can you collect

113
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,340
it the answer now is very easily

114
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,430
actually what can you do with it a lot

115
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,469
and tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help and when I say</font>

116
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">tools that can help these are all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

117
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:26,130
tools so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know obviously flow data is</font>

118
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,020
if you if you've ever used it you know

119
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,760
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great you know it gets a store</font>

120
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,340
we're going probably the issue is that

121
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have new analysts it's it's kind</font>

122
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,570
of hard to get into most<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

123
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">either command-line tools or you know</font>

124
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,900
large vendor products things like that

125
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,360
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also useful for a</font>

126
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,039
network situational awareness as well

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,410
it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a tool that can be</font>

128
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">shared amongst not just say cops but</font>

129
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,360
also netops and you know you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

130
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,860
that you in environments where you have

131
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of relationship maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

132
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,580
already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flow solution because you</font>

133
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,110
know why wouldn't network operations be

134
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,120
monitoring network flows or at least

135
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,070
have access to them to look at the

136
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">network well when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

137
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,240
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of large enterprises</font>

138
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,240
that have routing configurations and

139
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,610
different hardware specs that don't even

140
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,920
permit them to make flow data and I keep

141
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,810
using the word net flow and that's kind

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,090
of a misnomer because Cisco's

143
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,160

sampled flow data where a sample flow

out of what you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know</font>

153
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,669
100 records or thousand records and then

154
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,069
you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that to look at data now</font>

155
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,900
you take large you know communication

156
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,879
providers a lot of those community

157

communication providers within 100

158

166
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:19,099
want full pcap and it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

167
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:21,740
you know full pcap and it's awesome if

168
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:23,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a way to parse it but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

169
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,389
it's their pros and cons to it you know

170
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:29,748
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to capture there's tools</font>

171
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,219
like demon logger and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mix if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Angie and</font>

172
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">dump cap and a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different tools</font>

173
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,550
that will capture it all day<font color="#CCCCCC"> long you</font>

174
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,879
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of they'll even handle you</font>

175
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,849
know roll over and rotation vlogs very

176
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,770
easy to collect there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font>

177
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:45,050
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> security onion you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about by</font>

178
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">default its collecting pcap with no it</font>

179
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,699
no problem you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

180
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:52,399
it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and it's easy to use</font>

181
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">for detection you have tools that work</font>

182
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,240
directly off of it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you can take</font>

183
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,909
you know practically anything it seems

184
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,529
has a pcap option<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pcap on</font>

185
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:02,930
it even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not monitoring a</font>

186
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:06,199
network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> live and you say oh I have</font>

187
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,999
all this stuff from you know mueller

188
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,949
park or and it's all this malware data

189
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:12,319
well I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw that into some tool</font>

190
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,909
will like bro<font color="#CCCCCC"> will look at a peak a pass</font>

191
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,740
or can look at a pcap and everything

192
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,629
basically look at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> peak am so that's</font>

193
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,300
great but it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

194
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:22,310
and the beauty of pcap is obviously it

195
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,439
gives you everything but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> y which you</font>

196
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,879
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really determine yourself the</font>

197
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,490
time light of which you determine that

198
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,770
is really what's important and sometimes

199
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,419
only having you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though you</font>

200
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,309
have everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes that doesn't</font>

201
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,848
count if you can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the answers</font>

202
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:39,559
quickly so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have again who where the</font>

203
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,089
wind and the what but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

204
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:45,920
things that can also give you the same

205
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:48,529
thing so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance some Collins</font>

206
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,939
cat is you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest one I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

207
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,010
that you always hear people have a

208
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with us the actual you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

209
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,360
retention of peak at if you go into an

210
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,269
environment and you say oh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you click</font>

211
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,800
pcap you see a smile on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> face</font>

212
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:02,660
usually they're like oh yeah yeah it's

213
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,399
it's great you know we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage</font>

214
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,740
it all the time said well how much you

215
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually gather like well we have a week</font>

216
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,180
solid pcap and they're like really proud

217
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,070
of it and that's that's actually pretty

218
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,989
good for even some large environments

219
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,970
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't really</font>

220
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,610
help to determine you know the guy got

221
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,529
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 days ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really how did</font>

222
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,480
it get in Hootie pivot off of what did

223
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,370
he do you know how much information do

224
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,470
you really have with your only focused

225
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,380
on one data type that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think is the</font>

226
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,360
end all data type and<font color="#CCCCCC"> P kept kind of is</font>

227
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,279
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really powerful enough to</font>

228
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,980
look through that<font color="#CCCCCC"> peak at you constantly</font>

229
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,750
and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh 200 days from now I'll</font>

230
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,550
detect it well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

231
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,620
it got in so let's hope we can do

232
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,269
something about it and it's also not

233
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,370
really ideal for hunting again it goes

234
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:48,050
into you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that you can't</font>

235
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just take a peek at and say I</font>

236
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">won't throw in wireshark oh look they're</font>

237
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,449
all these packets someone find the bad

238
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,699
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz this is easy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do I have</font>

239
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:57,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything and maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

240
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">with several other other tools but again</font>

241
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to take breaking it down and</font>

242
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,859
in the end you'll find that oh well now

243
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,620
I've thrown it in to say i'm looking at

244
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,470
broken locks which you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bro</font>

245
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,829
fo flow basically so you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

246
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,390
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flow like data anyways to</font>

247
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,699
pinpoint where you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in the</font>

248
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,640
pcap well already<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know you</font>

249
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:22,459
should have had flow data another you

250
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,649
know big point is that for analysis and

251
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:26,479
this goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous point</font>

252
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,880
that in analysis it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a great</font>

253
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting point how often do you you know</font>

254
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,260
have some store alert and you say oh

255
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,970
well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted your look into</font>

256
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,740
everything I'm just going to pull you

257
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,480
know three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of peak at Fir you know</font>

258
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,670
some host or whatever on together just

259
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,380
around a certain time and look at all

260
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">these guys near</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it well that's not very</font>

261
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,510
feasible it's not easy to look at any

262
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,010
given thing even even if you're a you

263
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,110
know seasoned professional at this let

264
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,569
alone the junior line junior analyst you

265
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,440
can't really take a peek at and just

266
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,599
automatically know what's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font>

267
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,370
better to piece it apart find what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

268
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,570
want and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can dig into it and</font>

269
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,960
you're great

270
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,400
well you know the big your idea flow

271
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,440
data that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce today's</font>

272
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,780
that you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if you do have</font>

273
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,610
this full pcap but it's not useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

274
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,500
you until you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out what</font>

275
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,730
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at flow data will allow</font>

276
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that so the comparison of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peek</font>

277
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,160
at data versus flow data best comparison

278
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:25,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can think about Elise is you know</font>

279
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,069
so pcap you might have a recording of a

280
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,810
phone call and to really figure out

281
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,880
what's in that phone call it's like you

282
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,829
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the whole thing pick</font>

283
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,990
up on what's in there you may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

284
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,300
you know say you have a transcript you

285
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,730
can you know find whatever terms of the

286
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,579
log it's not too<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad but now let's say</font>

287
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,200
you have you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 days of these locks</font>

288
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,910
and maybe there's a hundred thousand

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,130
bees a day and you want to look through

290
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,079
all these all the time it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

291
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">feasible you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really do very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

292
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,820
that statistical analysis or anything on

293
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,890
that where is with flow data you're not

294
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,270
going to get the bulk of the data but

295
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,490
you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulk of what you want to</font>

296
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">start out with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the flow data really</font>

297
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,290
represents kind of like the call log of

298
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:09,140
those hundred thousand calls / you know

299
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,060
each day<font color="#CCCCCC"> for seven days you can still do</font>

300
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,680
something with that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then drill into</font>

301
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,739
what you want list<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their phone call</font>

302
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,670
you one<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comparison of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that mountain</font>

303
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus molehill cliche but you know the</font>

304
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,949
difference being that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can store</font>

305
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:27,620
hours or days or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have your lucky</font>

306
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,380
weeks of pcap you can store flow data

307
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,750
for months or years or indefinitely I

308
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,220
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even compare the months to</font>

309
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,750
that because I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know any</font>

310
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,570
organization who only stores a couple

311
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">months of flow data in fact many large</font>

313
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,000
with store flow data indefinitely if you

314
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,100
ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their very first flow</font>

315
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,930
record they ever ever started storing

316
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:53,510
they will be able to retrieve it with no

317
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:55,819
in no time it's a great use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

318
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations small relations alike but</font>

319
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,080
mainly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know at any given</font>

320
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,390
point it's it's not a bear together and

321
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,950
I'll show you you know later on again

322
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,960
you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast it is and it also</font>

323
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,670
takes up virtually no space by

324
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,670
comparison to a lot of other data types

325
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,670
like pcap for instance roughly if you

326
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,400
were to take a

327
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,589
p kappa<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it varies you know a little</font>

328
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,880
bit but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a sample p cab you</font>

329
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,220
process it through some of the tools

330
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,430
that will make silk data so flow data

331
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,070
the silk data will take a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 1</font>

332
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent 2 point 0 2 percent of the same</font>

333
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,520
space that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcap takes up now</font>

334
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,750
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> different there are different</font>

335
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,760
data types are used for different things

336
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,200
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just goes to show you that if</font>

337
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're gathering pcap already and</font>

338
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,340
devoting the storage for that vote just

339
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit for flow data and you can</font>

340
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,330
literally store it forever so there's

341
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,839
really no reason not to do it it's easy

342
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,340
to generate it's very very easy on

343
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,690
hardware to generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font>

344
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,550
generate yourself you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

345
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,330
focus on network operations to give it

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:58,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also just a little fact if that</font>

348
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:07,890
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically be the flow table so</font>

349
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:11,490
flow data often called session<font color="#E5E5E5"> data net</font>

350
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:13,920
flow data is it has a lot of different

351
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">terms based on what kind of device</font>

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,760
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> generating it from again there</font>

353
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,260
are some proprietary flow types and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

354
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,930
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those in a minute not in</font>

356
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,560
flow several times and when generally

when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk about flow data a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it doesn't always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be net</font>

360
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,590
flow that's Cisco proprietary it's

361
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,189
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know NetFlow</font>

362
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:40,350
data is not a summary of all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets</font>

363
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,780
it's the summary of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

364
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,220
communications so you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

packet number in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you may have</font>

366
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,090
bites you know by tonight you may have

367
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,250
record amounts of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many records are</font>

368
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,990
generated but if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up to you</font>

369
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,180
and says I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> a record of each peak or</font>

370
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,790
of each packet just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

371
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,650
the 52 bull then that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

372
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,920
make much sense by comparison hub the

373
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:04,290
flow communication itself the 52 points

374
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,719
self as you'll see is that it's a source

375
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,150
IP source port desopadec sport and

376
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,950
protocol there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> much else to it you</font>

377
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,620
see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other fields down there those</font>

378
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,260
are tagged along with it so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

382
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,550
extremely widely has 20 fields

383
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,319
two of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are padding fields however</font>

384
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,810
there are other versions you'll notice

385
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,900
in some proprietary<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow tools or</font>

386
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,119
flow tools sorry there are a lot of like

387
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,189
unique fields like you are I strings and

388
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,170
things like that well those are some

389
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,330
extra fields that are put in in the

390
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,670
padding of things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow version 9</font>

391
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,550
which actually has over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred field</font>

392
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:49,380
type definitions and then there's IP fix

393
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,660
which takes a lot of field type

394
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,270
definitions above<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow version 9 that</font>

395
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,380
allows those to be configurable as well

396
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,380
today I'll so the example I show you

397
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,030
uses IP fix but just as a standard of a

398
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,540
tool that's using it the big difference

399
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:06,540
is between version 5 and version 9 and

400
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,490
IP fix is in version 5 was not template

401
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it whereas version 9 is kind of a</font>

402
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,780
template approach and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

403
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:17,040
vendors can kind of do what they want to

404
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:19,770
with a lot of the fields that exist so

405
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,140
here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flow data just in a</font>

406
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">little text box looks pretty ugly but</font>

407
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,530
flows really do kind of look<font color="#E5E5E5"> overly like</font>

408
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,900
your communication log for your phone

409
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,430
would look but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

410
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,760
this if you have a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parse it</font>

411
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:36,859
again here you have 52 cool as well as a

412
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:40,350
source time and some I count at the end

413
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,020
so building flow records themselves you

414
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the float well</font>

415
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,060
again I'd already defined what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 tuple</font>

416
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,830
is but for the sake of this it's

417
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,140
important to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know if</font>

418
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,900
there's a source IP you know source for

419
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,819
desktop it does support a protocol well

420
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,410
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the collector the</font>

421
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,510
collector says oh I see this this is

422
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">unique combination within a certain time</font>

423

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,390
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold it there for a while and</font>

425
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,120
the wall is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time out that it's</font>

426
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,770
counting up well if another

427
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,629
communication comes in and it has the

428
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,060
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a different protocol it</font>

429
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,980
will generate a different flow record so

430
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,510
these might be you know simultaneous

431
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,339
communication is going on the same time

432
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,470
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important to note the only one</font>

433
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,179
that changes you get another record or

434
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,819
when there's a timeout do you get

435
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,800
another record and it's you can think of

436
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of assembly line this</font>

437
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,960
collector is bringing them in he stores

438
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,959
them in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bin he starts to a</font>

439
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,850
stopwatch and then he sets back and

440
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,220
keep coming in if another one comes in

441
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,830
he starts to stop watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> there well once</font>

442
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,250
this stopwatch ends he says ok go and

443
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,480
store that it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for query well</font>

444
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,340
meanwhile he's looking another<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

445
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,529
million records at the same time and

446
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,350
that's what this collector is actually

447
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing if it is like a new 52 pool again</font>

448
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,178
it goes to a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow record if it is</font>

449
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a new 52 politicans a pin into an</font>

451
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,010
time out these termination conditions

452
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,990
are as follows there are natural

453
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">timeouts which basically are there</font>

454
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,909
stateful protocols you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool</font>

455

that you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

456
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:19,919
flow records themselves it may vary on

457
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,480
how it interprets<font color="#E5E5E5"> these but it's doing</font>

458
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,770
more than just ripping out some header

459
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,320
date it's actually looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the date</font>

460
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,629
itself and if it gets a certain flag or

461
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatnot that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it says hey I'm done it</font>

462
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,860
might say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to close this</font>

463
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,840
record it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for querying now it'll</font>

464
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,158
tag it with you know an end date and

465
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,039
then you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready to actually look at</font>

466
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data another is the idle timeout</font>

467
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,690
which is pretty self-explanatory these

468
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,299
are all configurable by the way but the

469
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,159
idle timeout again it's ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> no more data</font>

470
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,529
is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in for this guy that it's been</font>

471
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,299
sitting over here 30 seconds gone by go

472
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,570
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put him into a record that is</font>

473
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,520
queryable now active time out is if you

474
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,889
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ongoing communication it just</font>

475
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,179
keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> going keeps going well at some</font>

476
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,980
point you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw that into a</font>

477
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,299
wrecker to make it queryable otherwise

478
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,960
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's happening</font>

479
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:09,360
and so you'll have this a common a

480
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,890
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake especially majunior</font>

481
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,080
analysts or people that are not

482
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">experienced flow data is they may see a</font>

483
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,220
bunch of records that are the same times

484
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,408
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a whole start date end date</font>

485
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're these same periods this must be</font>

486
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,980
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know anomalous activity</font>

487
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:25,080
or beginning activity or some kind of

488
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,419
weird activity what's actually activity

489
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,908
that they've defined happen it's just a

490
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,679
timeout 30 minute max timeout the

491
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,039
nonviolent communication just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps it</font>

492
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,039
keeps happening

493
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,840
so collection with flow data so there

494
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't a ton in here but if you</font>

495
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,360
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable saying what type</font>

496
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,610
of flow solution you use I would

497
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate I've asked us in multiple</font>

498
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:59,649
different environments but does anyone

499
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:01,479
use saq radars flow solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

500
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,830
anyone you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

501
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:14,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">pulse or anything else does anyone use</font>

502
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:15,879
silk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay does anyone use Argus okay so</font>

503
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,110
there are a few different ones pretty

504
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,520
varied and so flows you know the reason

505
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,679
I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with a saying this is</font>

506
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,560
kind of a history<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson is because</font>

507
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,950
flows haven't really been adopted really

508
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,460
quickly in fact you know the earliest

509
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:36,400
usages flows and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity or in</font>

510
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:39,010
1991 and you know here we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

511
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,380
still have in at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in most audiences</font>

512
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:44,050
I've ever survey you know ten percent or

513
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:48,370
less of socks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have flow</font>

514
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:51,129
solutions deployed yet you know in 1995

515
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,800
or 96 I Marcus wasn't even available to

516
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,410
the public but it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really</font>

517
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,820
adopted well and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

518
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are you know kind of buried you</font>

519
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,720
maybe it's a sec ops thought okay it's

520
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,910
not on us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> records</font>

521
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,370
will ask network operations and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

522
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,220
those might have it and but in the end

523
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,320
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also probably due to the fact that</font>

524
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,940
it wasn't easy to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this stuff</font>

525
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,220
set up you know you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

526
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring you know just the interface</font>

527
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,880
and taking in sedate it wouldn't be so

528
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,340
hard and especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're only</font>

529
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,600
getting this 5 20 at the time but it's

530
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,980
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult and if the</font>

531
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,389
tools aren't available a lot of

532
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,380
organizations don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the skill to</font>

533
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:32,350
set those kind of things up so

534
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,510
generating flow data again it's pretty

535
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,010
easy and there's there's multiple ways

536
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,260
to do you can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from hardware</font>

537
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,640
devices or you can software generate

538
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,930
flow data which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font>

539
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,660
recommend to people if they have the

540
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:46,980
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sox a lot of times</font>

541
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:49,049
they'll have some sort of network tap

542
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,980
or some sort of port mirror something

543
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,440
that they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> their data off of</font>

544
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,330
and and running you know during peak at

545
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,220
from or anything like that well if you

546
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,559
you're in that situation there's a

547
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,870
little literally no reason why you can't

548
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,879
generate flow data on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own in an</font>

549
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,799
unsafe old-fashioned you know the last

550
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you want to do is to go to your</font>

551
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,400
network operations to say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

552
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,410
know all you have a sampled flow data

553
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,450
but I still want it it's better than

554
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,580
nothing but it's not much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

555
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing because in in security</font>

556
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,918
operations in instant response you know

557
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,510
having that one communication summary

558
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,860
out of a thousand doesn't really help

559
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,440
you may tell you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> network health</font>

560
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,969
you may see that you got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos when you</font>

561
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,220
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have network connectivity</font>

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,080
or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the spike or</font>

563
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,790
whatever in this health but that's all

564
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,949
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will do for you you really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

565
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,559
have unsampled data and the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

566
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,240
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to generate it on your own</font>

567
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,428
maintain the device on your own and it's

568
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,230
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to do so there are</font>

569
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:45,480
multiple flow types as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned</font>

570
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,460
before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot of these again are</font>

571
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,340
proprietary but there's you know Cisco's

572
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">netflow there's IP fix and there's said</font>

573
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,709
you know s flow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> J flow and net</font>

574
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:58,470
stream and see flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> D and F flow and etc</font>

575
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,880
etc etc every vendor seems to see how to

576
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,890
have their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> little version of flow</font>

577
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,970
data you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the differences</font>

578
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,280
though is where they stick in

579
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,350
proprietary information and that's where

580
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,270
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets them apart you know the big</font>

581
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,100
competition with vendors is that you

582
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,780
know you have you know regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 tuple</font>

583
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,668
day that you could look through you know

584
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,440
how you know pretty is your UI but also

585
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:19,110
what else is in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

586
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,370
flow related its metadata that's just

587
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,370
kind of a pendant on to them

588
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:32,870
so popular platforms that popular free

589
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,000
platforms that generate flow data you

590
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,340
know I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Argus and mainly</font>

591
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,970
because security onion has Argus in it

592
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,820
and by default not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people seem</font>

593
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,010
to to realize it right off the bat<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

594
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,080
Argus is actually you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

595
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,580
being you know one of the the oldest

596
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,250
solutions that were available to the

597
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,020
public but also you know Carter Bullard

598
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,300
was on the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to really be using</font>

599
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:00,200
net<font color="#E5E5E5"> float for any kind of cyber security</font>

600
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,930
purposes and the prosta Argus is that

601
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,450
you know for a free solution it does

602
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:07,970
have metadata support it's also very

603
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,370
reliable it's fast collection it's

604
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,350
bi-directional flows which is a you know

605
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,570
you could say that's good or bad a lot

606
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,909
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people prefer unidirectional well I</font>

607
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,919
prefer bidirectional the difference

608
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,180
being is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by directionless you know</font>

609
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,770
you communicate out and the guy

610
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,860
communicates back in that's one flow

611
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:27,110
well if it is unidirectional the source

612
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,760
IP communicates back out well if another

613
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,439
communication comes around and the

614
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,150
source IP is different the response

615
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,800
communication it's going to say that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

616
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,230
different flow that's essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

617
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,879
difference the downside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Argus and</font>

618
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,810
hopefully this will change at some point

619
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,840
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well supported as far as</font>

620
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:47,149
documentation goes if you go out to the

621
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,600
the wiki you'll find a lot of page under

622
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,550
development since like 2012 but you know

623
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,500
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an extremely cool tool that is</font>

624
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,690
already you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there in security</font>

625
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,640
onion if you've never you know mess of

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,590
flow data at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all but you probably miss a</font>

security onion go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start that</font>

628
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:06,500
back up and just try to run some some

629
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,120
Argus commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in if dump is you</font>

630
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,790
know very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to set up and use it's</font>

631
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">very accessible it's one of those things</font>

632
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,770
that if if you weren't already you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

633
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,570
first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what flow data is and</font>

634
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,040
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea what you wanted to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

635
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,629
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing</font>

636
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,240
you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking up flow</font>

637
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:26,150
solutions the only downside is it's not

638
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,220
really incredibly wide use in very large

639
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,160
enterprises there are a lot of smaller

640
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:34,550
companies that use in<font color="#E5E5E5"> F dump but not</font>

641
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,140
really large ones the there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also NF</font>

642
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,180
sim that works within it

643
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,930
and it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a visualization tool</font>

644
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,010
that's pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get going so silk</font>

645
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:46,400
is 1 i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about</font>

646
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:49,550
mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> today silk has awesome analysis</font>

647
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,610
tools it's very easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once you get</font>

648
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,080
to using it but you know it has

649
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,570
traditionally had a more involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font>

650
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,909
you know for instance Argus has you know

651
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,310
its own built-in collector<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas silk</font>

652
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:04,130
you know you generally use you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know yeah</font>

653
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,409
for some other collector it doesn't have

654
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,900
its own sorry generator it doesn't have

655
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,700
its own generator it has its own

656
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,920
collector are to be flow package i'll

657
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,440
discuss in a minute but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's been</font>

658
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,000
a more involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up later the scripts</font>

659
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,730
will get rid of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that though it's not</font>

660
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,980
a big deal it also has by far the best

661
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,840
documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of probably any tool I've</font>

662
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,180
ever used of any kind not just flow

663
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,340
dated and very awesome stuff awesome

664
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,440
guys that work with it and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

665
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,409
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chance to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the flow con as</font>

666
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,060
well they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much always there</font>

667
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:38,030
it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note that Argus and</font>

668
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,169
silt both were without Carnegie Mellon

669
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,180
they probably would have happened

670
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,970
Carnegie Mellon is basically one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

671
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:47,750
biggest pushers of flow data and they've

672
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:49,700
made flows accessible to everyone you

673
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:53,450
know that you know regardless of how

674
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,220
your funding is a silk by comparison

675
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,190
some of these other tools silk can

676
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,590
handle 12 billion flows per day pretty

677
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,630
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not just the analysis</font>

678
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,919
tools but even in order to be flow pack

679
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,690
a single instance might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

680
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,410
collect all those flows with no problems

681
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:13,670
if you can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them silk is unit</font>

682
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:16,040
direction so silk is sis operator at

683
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,780
level knowledge again Carnegie Mellon

684
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,389
has put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that together I still maintain</font>

685
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,730
it they still do regular releases now

686
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,590
they had a hiatus for a while on public

687
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,780
releases but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because they're also</font>

688
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,070
partly funded that government funded as

689
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,200
well so things have to go through a

690
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,120
review and but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they've had some</font>

691
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty frequent releases it's</font>

692
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,840
essentially two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there's</font>

693
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,419
the packing sweet that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send it</font>

694
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,939
flow data it will pack it up into some

695
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:44,180
files and then you can parse that with

696
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,880
the analysis sweet a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

697
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,860
the term silk database really it's not

698
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's so database as much as it is</font>

699
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,059
a bunch of binary files that are stored

700
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:54,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a directory structure that is</font>

701
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:57,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the input so when you actually</font>

702
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,880
run commands there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> input switch</font>

703
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,040
it's essentially looking in those

704
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,510
directories directly and that's why it's

705
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,129
sort of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way again here this the</font>

706
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:09,559
documentation and community the

707
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:12,130
documents there's not just references to

708
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously the tools but they also have a</font>

709
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,740
analysis or an analyst kind of a

710
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,720
workbook by which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start out it</font>

711
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,840
is like several<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred pages long</font>

712
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,419
though but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty awesome in the</font>

713
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,740
analysis sweet and the main tool that

714
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:29,720
you'll use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll discuss in a minute</font>

715
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,640
is this filter tool the whole point of

716
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,340
flow data is again to filter down to

717
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,290
data that you really need the main tool

718
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,959
is called RW filter you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

719
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,730
everything later on starts with RW but

720
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,590
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also display and sort do</font>

721
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:46,160
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could do to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

722
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:48,559
do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of analysis on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data a</font>

723
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,929
typical silk collection architectures is

724
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,790
really simple you'll have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> F probe</font>

725
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:56,809
sensor may be generating submit flow

<font color="#CCCCCC">of router that's sending flow data and</font>

728

you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah for something that's</font>

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,450
sending some IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data and these can</font>

730
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,390
all be sending to this one silk server

731
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,280
that's running the packing<font color="#E5E5E5"> sweet namely</font>

732
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,410
just RW flow packets the tool that runs

733
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,629
on there<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's collecting based on the</font>

734
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,610
sensor configuration that says oh you

735
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,160
know send your f probe is here so you

736
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,320
can define that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> national</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensors in</font>

739
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:27,890
want you can add any number of these and

740
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,410
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> artery flow pack can handle quite</font>

741
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,450
a bit of data then you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

742
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:35,600
analyst workstation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the s the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">silt tools on it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that then query from</font>

744
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,668
that server that silk server or you have

them<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh directly just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look server which</font>

746
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:44,860
is not always ideal for obvious reasons

747
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:51,190
so what you need to get going with silk

748
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:54,260
you need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> source again I recommend</font>

749
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,220
software sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you aren't</font>

things where that might stop some day<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

752
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,700
you know we decided we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch the</font>

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,919

763
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,010
that just for debugging purposes even if

764
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,929
the analyst<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't going to actually go</font>

765
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:29,450
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have all they</font>

you also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the analyst him or herself</font>

768
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:38,570
the annals workstation may have the silk

00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,570

770
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:43,039
they can access<font color="#CCCCCC"> the silk server directly</font>

771
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,720
accessing it directly you know obviously

772
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll need access to that data</font>

00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,879
filter through based on different

781
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,860

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,280
data are you looking at that can either

784
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,110
be a file that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given it say</font>

785
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,330
you've generated some sort of flow data

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,100
from some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know somewhere else off of</font>

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,158
a pcap or anything like that then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,449
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say art of you filter you know</font>

789
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,460
Tessa pcap not hard to be after

790
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,140
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you also have to</font>

791
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,000
give it a partitioning switch and an

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,309
output switch partitioning switch will

793
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,720
be what date are you looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for if</font>

794
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,760
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font>

795
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,220
you an example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute our table cut</font>

796
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,080
generates<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine or takes binary data</font>

797
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,970
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the output of our to be filter</font>

798
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,580
and converts that to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human readable</font>

799
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:42,590
format as I discussed before silk

800
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,840
records everything in these binary files

801
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,879
while even<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you process it with our</font>

802
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,010
to be filter it continuously just sends

803
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,620
it to other other silk files well to

804
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,539
actually see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want RW cut but</font>

805
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,428
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to take our w cut output</font>

806
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:57,260
and grep through and use a bunch of bash

807
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:59,690
tools right<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bat because</font>

808
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,419
generally the other silk tools they will

809
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">do these things much faster they they</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredibly powerful are to be stats</font>

811
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,799
it does stats right so

812
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,120
generate statistics based on a whole lot

813
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I show it several</font>

814
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,350
examples later but let's say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

815
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:19,059
your tops it and it pairs do that

816
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:21,980
seconds if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the amount of unique</font>

country codes a certain you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know source</font>

818
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,390
ideas talk to it'll give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">this guy's talk to 50 and this guy's</font>

talk to you know 31 and it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

the amount that they've talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

822
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,279
will give you basically any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

823
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,158
stats you can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that relate to a</font>

five people are dumb account kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

825
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,919
takes it away and looks at a much bigger

826
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,470
picture it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> bins of data which data</font>

827
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,200
can be records packets or bytes it'll

828
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,149
Bend all that up<font color="#CCCCCC"> into certain you know</font>

829
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,370
configurable size bins to actually look

830
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:55,070
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say oh there were X amount of</font>

831
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,840

832

second<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the next minute had this</font>

00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,220
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bytes and so on pretty ideal</font>

834
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,529
for you know a line chart or something

835
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:09,980
like that show you know conditions over

836
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:12,260
time an example of RW filter this is a

837
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,220
pretty ugly example and it's ugly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

838
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,049
purpose because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you an example</font>

839
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,669
have already been cut in a minute but

840
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is where you can draw all data</font>

841
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:21,730
you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have dash dash type</font>

842
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:25,669
equals all that is an input filter I

843
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:27,590
have dash dash protocol equals 0 to 255

844
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,419
that's just saying look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at everything</font>

845
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,279
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that's example I was using that</font>

846
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:33,020
you have to have a partitioning switch

847
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,880
but the partitioning so it doesn't have

848
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,279
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of sense in this case I</font>

849
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,960
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> said give me all these protocols</font>

850
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,549
when is that useful what's useful if

851
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,529
you're using some sort of tool like our

852
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">DB count to just get a stat of your</font>

passing quill standard out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

855
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,419
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and stick that to</font>

856
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,789
standard out but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you can't</font>

857
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:57,830
read binary so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be cut says</font>

858
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:59,870
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i already that for you and then it</font>

859
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,389
produces something like this which is a

860
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:05,299
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to look at which is why you</font>

861
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,960
generally want to to knock things down a

862
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:10,460
little bit here I've increased the

863
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,929
partitioning switches but right off of

864
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,119
that I want to point<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the very</font>

intereses are to be cut dash<font color="#E5E5E5"> text fields</font>

866
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,169
it's a much smaller output because I've

867
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,359
said hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> only show me you know</font>

868
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:23,069
what kind of data there actually is not

869
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,168
exactly looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the five tuple hear</font>

870
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:27,389
that but I'm looking for four out of the

871
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:30,418
five as well as the type of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is</font>

specific week and now it's it's kind of

879
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:54,509
obvious once you actually start looking

880
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:56,790
at it but you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just hype</font>

881
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:59,220
equals also that means any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of data</font>

882
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:02,220
if it's in or out if its internal

internal if its external day external

884
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,160
which is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example probably some sort</font>

of misconfigured sensor follow but you

886
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,270
also have we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at where</font>

any port is 41 142 and by any port it

888
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:20,940
means where the source port or the desk

889
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,190
port is 41 142 you'll notice an example

looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a splash of all data again</font>

notice the protocol equals as<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero to</font>

900
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:55,079

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really needed it's your</font>

00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,440
we're looking at a splash of all data

906

only displaying the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 well you'll</font>

actually gave it but said dash dash

are valid conversations we're trying to

931
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,250
get valid conversations at least and

932
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,660
probably could have put in an additional

933
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,040
initial flag setting there that would

934
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,109
have probably hammered that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

935
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,060
closer to being accurate but again we

936
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,530
look at a splash of data where these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

937
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,660
conversations that we hope are

938
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:15,140
legitimate and we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,410
there's actually been quite a day this

941
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a pretty big set of sample data to</font>

00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,820
can see here are the top 10 outbound

destination country codes by records

946
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,470
instead I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always hype on you know</font>

947
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,330
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many records</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

948
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,700
because again those can vary based some

00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:41,270
time outs of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 19 but here we are looking</font>

00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,210
for any type of data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is out or out</font>

951
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,640
web data which those are determined

952
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,440
again by the configuration files for

953
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,589
silk itself when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> first set it up</font>

954
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,430
it's a splash of any data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is outer</font>

destination country codes a rural

957
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,580
example again these don't usually tell

958
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,380
you exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers you're looking</font>

959
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,410
for sometimes they give you a pretty

960
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear idea with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or no</font>

961
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:14,660
false-positive sometimes in this case

962
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,830
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some traditionally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:24,560
every bit of the data with<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

965
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:28,550

destination country codes as the actual

968
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:36,410
value this time so previously we do use

969
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,940
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes and whatnot well this</font>

970
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,799
time it's counting up it's looking at

971
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,140
every single record

972
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">has these ports and it's saying oh let</font>

973
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,940
me look at every distinct or every

974
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,010
country code and count all those up and

975
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,050
then give me the guy that has anything

more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> three country codes where he's</font>

you know outbound stuff and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not always accurate but you can pretty</font>

00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,850
this actually looks like you know here

998
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,649
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say this looks like HTTP</font>

999

traffic well how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1000
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,420
destination ports use things that look

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTP traffic well it should have</font>

1002
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,590
said if it was all you know non mismatch

data there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one it should have</font>

been 80 unfortunately the<font color="#E5E5E5"> app label</font>

1005
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,509
doesn't always look at things like 80 80

1006
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,430
and other no common web ports and things

1007
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:06,920
like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all 23 different</font>

1008
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:09,950
ports in this data that we're actually

1009
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,930
HTTP data and again as you go down

1010
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,029
through there and what it thought was

1011
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:16,069
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off five</font>

1012
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:18,380
different port so maybe you know an SSH

1013
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,630
on non-standard ports or whatnot in the

1014

1016
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,330

1017
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,670
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send flag as the initial flag</font>

1018
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,810
and we won

1019
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,970
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're at least four</font>

00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:47,080
desk port pairs where we're looking at

1027
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,500
intelligence data a pretty big fan of it

1028
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,940
pretty fond<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the idea that if you</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's on your network then</font>

1030
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,870
you probably don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real good idea</font>

1031
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,640
what's happening on your network you

1032
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,470
know friendly intelligence gathering is

1033
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,850
just as important it's looking for the

don't know really what to watch more

1038
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:15,190
carefully but it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to do</font>

1039
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,790
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you example how to do</font>

1040
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,980
this with silk here's identifying SSH

1041
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:23,830
servers just by port you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also do a</font>

1042
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,840
playable if you're using yeah but here's

1043
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,910
identifying web servers which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

1044
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,470
for you know actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1045
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,600
reasonable connections and things like

1046
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:33,609
that you can also add a threshold on

1047
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,190
that the larger enterprises<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

better<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so actual detection with</font>

1049
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,420
flow data and you know over the course

00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">of detection in general you had</font>

1051
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,650
signature-based things you know like

behavioral based things like bro or

00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,819
pretty cool but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people aren't</font>

1070
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,730
you know this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

1071
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:26,920
understand well here's this plot to that

1072
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,540
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a better idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spike or</font>

1073
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,350
something and they'll believe you off of

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust here's a map which is good</font>

1075
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a dashboard I won't go into the</font>

1076
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,670
actual details and have the queries

1077
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,839
themselves you can look at those later

1078
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,900
here's a line chart<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's basically</font>

1079
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,960
looking at splash of all data

to flow flow plotter and say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1082
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:53,339
line chart 600 seconds by bikes and

1083
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,779
here's a treemap a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1084
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:56,788
requested treat maps and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like</font>

1085
00:42:54,779 --> 00:43:00,599
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you like treat maps you can</font>

1086
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:02,549
use this one here's a pie borrower

1087
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,799
column chart it's all the same data in

1088
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:07,529
the actual charts but it's looking for

1089
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:08,690
high port high port stuff this bubble

1090
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:10,680
chart a little hard to explain

1091
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially the time I have but it</font>

1092
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,339
basically says hey are we looking at

1093
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,259
real communications are we looking at

1094
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:17,700
you know just maybe some scanning you

1095
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,410
can do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things based</font>

1096
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the query coming in but it's</font>

1097
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:26,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically a comparison of packets versus</font>

1098
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:28,140
records<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus bites so you know if you</font>

1099
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of packets per record or if you</font>

1100
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lot of bytes per record you can</font>

1101
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:33,359
make some inferences off of this more

1102
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:35,609
useful for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyst actually looking</font>

1103
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,430
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data than sharing it now here's a</font>

1104
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:43,049
timeline of a given IP and this is this

1105
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:45,779
172 189 124 166 maybe you can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1106
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:47,730
this but as it goes along as you'll see

1107
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:50,069
it's saying every<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP it communicated</font>

1108
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:52,410
with when it communicated with it and

1109
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:55,470
showing comparisons between each again

1110
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:58,020
it runs like all the rest of those force

1111
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,848
directed graph it will really lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1112
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,299
to any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know here's the bad</font>

1113
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:05,220
guy but it may show to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-worker or</font>

1114
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:07,109
manager you know here's an example of

1115
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,669
kind of what's happening here and in

1116
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:10,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">this example I'm you know showing you</font>

1117
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,630
know you can say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a blue</font>

1118
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,849
guys stick it over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1119
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:17,520
to say oh there's a bad guy or a good

00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:19,529
guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in here color of red kollam</font>

1121
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,210

1123
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:28,079
that a little later here is some acid

1124
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,430
discovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools so i showed you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

1125
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,319
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of acid discovery</font>

1126
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,930
earlier with silk well this will do it

1127
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:35,700
all automatically so you see these

1128
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,799
servers that have been shown here which

1129
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,439
there's web servers smtp servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

1131
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,910
command which has no options at all

1132
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:46,319
unless you threshold some data will

1133
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,700
output something like this for your

1134
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,099
environment if you just have silver

1135
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,660
running and this is pretty useful for

1136
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,520
determining what you actually have on

1137
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,460
your network again

1138
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,350
your friendly assets so analysis with

1139
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,470
flow data a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a summary of what it</font>

1140
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:02,180
does for you previously pcap kind of

1141
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:04,220
gets you in a bind when you're actually

1142
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,290
reducing the data set thirty-five

1143
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,379
percent of your first hour may be spent

1144
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:11,210
reducing them with flow data it takes

1145
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,770
that away it gives you eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1146
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:14,630
your first hour to actually make

1147
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:16,220
decisions you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> pivot off your flow</font>

1148
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,380
data straight to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcap and understand</font>

1149
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,959
what you have there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are barriers to</font>

1150
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,210
entry namely it's very hard for junior

1151
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,250
analyst to read and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bear here is</font>

1152
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:27,740
so what they'd output looks terrible

1153
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:29,120
right cheering<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's seize this if</font>

1154
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:31,129
you're good at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're one of those</font>

1155
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,660
guys you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like a monster because</font>

1156
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,820
you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird you stick to this</font>

1157
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:37,370
all the time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could there be</font>

1158
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,070
another way if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> an experienced</font>

1159
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:42,529
analyst you have the power already but

1160
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:44,420
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want more power well we have</font>

1161
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,550
flow back you don't need silk command

1162
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:49,610
line anymore necessarily you can use

1163
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:52,340
flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> bat to parse through all that silt</font>

data it's a graphical front end it uses

1165
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,690
node we use the meteor framework to set

1166
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:59,000
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you can install locally or you can</font>

1167
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,770
install<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SSH and we've basically</font>

1168
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,290
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any of the things and silk</font>

1169
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:07,400
take those out if they were kind of bad

1170
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:08,600
and you know deploy selections and make

1171
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,570
it to where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can easily set these</font>

1172
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,100
things up so for instance we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1173
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,210
you know autocomplete things like that

1174
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,250
so you don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up the</font>

1175
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,870
commands you want even<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still mess up</font>

1176
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,390
some of these partitioning switches and

1177
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:23,210
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> autocomplete things it'll</font>

1178
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:25,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">find data really quickly you know also</font>

1179
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:27,350
pivot off of data you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up</font>

1180
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,540
certain ports you can add things to the

1181
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:31,370
query you can basically do anything you

1182
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,200
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do if you</font>

1183
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:36,109
can't make a pull request or make a

1184
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,970
issue it'll also pivot off of other

1185
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:40,070
information so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> could click on those</font>

comfortable with float or with silk

1190
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,089
already you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can generate all these</font>

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to for some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

1194
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,560

00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn silk you can do it straight off of</font>

sortable columns as well

1198
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,730
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make some stats</font>

1199
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,620
right now but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the actual flow</font>

00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,009
flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> bat if you want them you could have</font>

1204

had them at the beginning of talk and

1205
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,600
had it in like 10 minutes run these

1206
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:27,790
commands and you'll have completely set

1207
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:28,779
up you'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to your go to flow</font>

1208
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,759
back you'll set it up in the

1209
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,380
configuration and flow path and next

1210
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,000
thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you will be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">data that you just collected why you</font>

1213
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,510
download float back actually I'm

1214
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to identify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this in a few</font>

1215
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,290
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so it's going to be one</font>

1216
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,420
command and saved it as curl flow bad

1217
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:49,500
installed pipe dissection it'll be

1218
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:52,450
installed probably around four minutes

1219
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,130
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion flow data very</font>

1220
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:56,080
underused very underrated it's been

1221
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,640
around forever but only ten percent of

1222
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,529
us are using it we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> really be</font>

1223
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,569
using it more because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be saving</font>

1224
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,820
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty five percent of our time</font>

1225
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:06,130
for every first hour of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sort of</font>

then obviously silk again I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>
