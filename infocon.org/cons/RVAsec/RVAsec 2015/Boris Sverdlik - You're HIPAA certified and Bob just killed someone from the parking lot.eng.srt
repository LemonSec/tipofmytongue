00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,299
so you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn anything</font>

2
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:26,110
new in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk this is actually</font>

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,520
recycled material per se Jake asked me

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,060
to talk last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had some</font>

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,168
issues so it's there's some stuff still

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,640
relevant I was thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

7
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:34,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">other day if I should if I should come</font>

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,190
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new and I started</font>

9
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,349
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking at the stuff and</font>

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,780
it's still as relevant today as it was

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,700
as it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year ago I've added some</font>

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,620
I've added a couple couple of

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,469
interesting slides based on why

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,790
nothing's changing and unless we see

15
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,590
some type of reform nothing's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,560
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll get into that in a few</font>

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:58,570
minutes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,060
hip is certified in Bob just killed Bob

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,930
just killed someone from the parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially it's an overview of why</font>

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,130
HIPAA doesn't do shit for your state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,529
security so if you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care or</font>

23
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,658
you have any type of sensitive health

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,170
health data any type of pH I which

25
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:21,460
applies across the board in any industry

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:23,109
the legislation surrounding the

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,059
legislation surrounding HIPAA and now

28
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:27,068
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-tech an omnibus really want to shit</font>

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,979
to secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> its a secure environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

30
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:33,969
even less so than pci or socks and yeah

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,560
if you want to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> something i</font>

34
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:41,350

48
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on almost 15 years in the</font>

49
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,500
industry and that's 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actual</font>

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,870
security I've never been an IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,720
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never done network administration</font>

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:27,379
I've never done systems admin I grew up

breaking shit got into some<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble with</font>

54
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:34,099
some phones may be in the mid 90 to

55
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">mid-90s if it wasn't for this I'd be</font>

asking people if they want fries with

57
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:39,980
that I don't know dick outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

58
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,720
security again started on the opposite

59
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,909
side somehow got sucked into defense I

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,940
spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years heading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up security for</font>

61
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:48,230
some of the world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest financials</font>

62
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,909
specifically the one specifically the

63
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,738
world's largest commodity shop Iran

64
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:53,298
global security for them a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

65
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,680
ago the economy took the tank I don't

66
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,799
know if you guys remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> societe</font>

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">generale was in the news dude pretty</font>

68
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,829
much move the economy were like five

69
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:03,950
billion dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days in</font>

70
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:07,310
segregation after that so we were their

71
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,290
largest subsidiary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again it was an</font>

72
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,150
IT guy who decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

73
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,638
business side and kept his kept this

74
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:17,780
provisioning so change<font color="#E5E5E5"> management failed</font>

75
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:19,579
there sorry not sorry the fact that the

76
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,609
deck is like I said the talks kind of

77
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:24,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we'll see when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we go through it</font>

78
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:27,500
a lot of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff still relevant</font>

79
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:33,019
and I have made some I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> made some</font>

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:36,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting changes um so the I was in</font>

81
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:39,919
security when hippo is just the wet

82
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,780
dream for Clinton it was essentially

83
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,329
built out so we can easier issues so

84
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can easily share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done easily easily</font>

85
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,620
shares healthcare healthcare data with

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,370
providers and vendors they didn't take

87
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:55,310
security into account at i was at sprint

88
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,319
in 2001 when the first hip assessments

89
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,870
were coming out even before it was even

90
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,099
before the legislation was ratified and

91
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,780
it was an interesting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

92
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,369
interesting dynamic as we're like yeah

93
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,019
fucking it's another rag<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just pen</font>

94
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,609
testing write write write up the report

95
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,169
do the gap analysis will never be erased

96
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:13,340
them out so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was 14 years ago and</font>

97
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,079
nothing's fucking changed like high-tech

98
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,810
an omnibus have added a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

99
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,600
provisions but essentially it really

100
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,040
doesn't cover your security it's more

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,380
cover your ass as opposed to coverage

102
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,100
security so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be a little</font>

103
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a scenario</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might or might</font>

104
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,780
not have happened depending on where

105
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,760
that recording goes we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

106
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,440
about Bob that's strictly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a strictly</font>

107
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,870
based on theory nothing was<font color="#CCCCCC"> owned</font>

108
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,490
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened nobody no records are</font>

109
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,750
stolen well no records were exfiltrated

110
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,850
if you hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitstrips get up and leave</font>

111
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,860
now I'm not a graphic designer I still

112
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,770
fucking images off the internet like

113
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:57,040
everybody else for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their slides so why</font>

114
00:04:50,770 --> 00:05:00,310
are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> here bob was diagnosed with</font>

115
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,340
cancer in 2012 nobody's dying at school

116
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,770
whatever fuck it he had a biopsy<font color="#CCCCCC"> son and</font>

117
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:09,340
colleges got a pet pet scan and started

118
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,159
antibody treatments Bob's wife one<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

119
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,830
the second opinion Bob couldn't get his

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,300
own medical records so apparently the

121
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,099
only thing hip was really good at is

122
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,310
keeping medical records out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

123
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:24,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">patient's hands we went through tons of</font>

124
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,950
calls met with actually has his<font color="#CCCCCC"> lawyers</font>

125
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,020
sundin he send letters to the facility

126
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there should try to pick</font>

127
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,650
up his<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to get their records</font>

128
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,680
released in after back and forth and all

129
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,239
sorts of shit Bob wanted to experiment

130
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,430
on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be getting you</font>

131
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,050
easily be<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to get his own data</font>

132
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:46,750
out of the this facility interesting

133
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,900
dynamic this time this facility might or

134
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,660
might not reside in northern california

135
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,030
so before we go further again we'll go

136
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,780
over some<font color="#CCCCCC"> basics on what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security of</font>

137
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:01,539
what HIPAA really is I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

138
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,330
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in healthcare do you guys</font>

139
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,700
understand what HIPAA is what do you

140
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,590
think HIPAA is and come up here to come

141
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,900
up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use with my guy but I love</font>

142
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:16,440
having these back and forth come up here

143
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,440

146
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,110
is or what you've been told him is what

147
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,330
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told that's probably an easier</font>

148
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,330
thing to answer yeah that's cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

150
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:48,550
hospitals and what we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been told HIPAA</font>

151
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:50,169
is is a law written to basically tell

152
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,050
hospitals what they have to do to

153
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:56,049
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> patient data nope that's what</font>

154
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,199
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been told it is oh I'm with you</font>

155
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,180
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that again I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came from the offense</font>

156
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
side when this thing was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

157
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,770
what they told us<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so I actually</font>

158
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,539
read the legislation that some and i

159
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,639
have i have a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool quote in one</font>

161
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool quote on has nothing to do</font>

162
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,919
with security it's an easier way to

163
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,650
share pay share patient information

164
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,560
between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors and providers</font>

165
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,349
and so it's covered in these providers

166
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,849
health care health and hospital and

167
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:28,779

Kennedy pointed out all the really

175
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:46,529
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool issues so these are the</font>

176
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:49,509
sites they tell you that they tell

177
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,919
search engines not to index so obviously

178
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,500
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go there right so there</font>

179
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,020
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cool stuff in there really</font>

180
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,360
really great development practices that

181
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare gov had they were</font>

182
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,020
technically supposed to be HIPAA

183
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,810
compliant because they did have patient

184
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,448
they had ph i ph eyes kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weird</font>

185
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,120
thing so what do they tell you that's PA

186
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:16,810
with at your at your hospital what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

187
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:23,560
they say is ph<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say exactly that's not</font>

188
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:27,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">ph I that's PII thing PII mph I have a</font>

189
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,410
shitload of overlap and anybody remember

190
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:32,390
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance company called anthem</font>

191
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,640
you guys remember anthem<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 billion</font>

192
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever the fuck records they claim</font>

193
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">though ph I was breached medical record</font>

194
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,190
numbers are technically considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> pH I</font>

195
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,200
if there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a name phone number and the</font>

196
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,470
medical record number that's pH I that's

197
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,590
where it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> VII</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch bhi sorry</font>

198
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:55,310
anthem you guys are lying look get<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000</font>

199
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,810
good so HIPAA the HIPAA privacy rule

200
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,939
provides federal protections for

201
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,069
individuals individually identifiable

202
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,840
health information held by covering

203
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,400
enemies and their business<font color="#E5E5E5"> associates</font>

204
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,720
and gives patients at the array of

205
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rights apparently Bob had no rights with</font>

206
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,600
respect to that to that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

207
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,010
the same time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Privacy Rule is</font>

208
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">balanced so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from its disclosure of</font>

209
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,069
health<font color="#CCCCCC"> information needed for patient</font>

210
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,660
care and other and other important

211
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,610
purposes you guys all sign that little

212
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,770
form when you go to see a new dr right

213
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">and yeah go ahead share my data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

214
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool unfortunately sharing it with you</font>

215
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,150
is totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> different it's not covered in</font>

216
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,800
their security rule specifies that

217
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,420
series of administrative physical and

218
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,250
technical safeguards for cover it for

219
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,900
covered entities<font color="#CCCCCC"> and their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

220
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,300
associates so sure the confidentiality

221
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,069
integrity and availability of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eltron</font>

222
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,420
protected health information we're all

223
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,500
cissp is right we know what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

224
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,270
cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially it really doesn't</font>

225
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security rule actually only states</font>

226
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:53,199
that you need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the next one a</font>

227
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:57,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit we'll get inside of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

228
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only real requirement and as opposed</font>

229
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,500
to addressable so when you look at the

230
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,170
hit when you look at performing hit but

231
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,820
assessments even internally<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything's</font>

232
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,199
addressable except for the requirement

233
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,750
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement is that you do a</font>

234
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,700
risk assessment we all know how useless

235
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,380
risk assessments are right i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font>

236
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">Trustwave to say I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI certified in</font>

237
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,650
school target but yeah it's that's how

238
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,020
things work covered entities is also a

239
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,640
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird so everyone here is</font>

240
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,949
technically a covered entity so either

241
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,220
your insurance carrier so your mom pop

242
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,370
position health plan a<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearinghouse so</font>

243
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,540
if you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with patient records</font>

244
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,250
and I'll get into in a few minutes so I

245
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,890
spent the last six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of my life at</font>

246
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Obamacare startup insurance company</font>

247
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:43,449
doing some really really funny things

248
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,220
these insurance companies don't

249
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,690
necessarily process all their data in

250
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,970
house they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party they use</font>

251
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,860
third-party providers hip has got this

252
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,630
really cool document the hip that's got

253
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,970
this really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> process that says you</font>

254
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,740
can get a baa and we'll get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

255
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,620
the area yeah I guess the one of the

256
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,589
slides you can get a ba between you and

257
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,690
this vendor or provider that says the

258
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:07,210
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of providers willing to protect</font>

259
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,860
your data cool you just take it at face

260
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,880
value its contractual at that point

261
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,200
right if your data gets breached though

262
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,450
anthems going to be in the news not this

263
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,279
third-party mom-and-pop Ohio nobody's

264
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,110
ever heard of them whatever right it's

265
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,550
cool you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys remember when citibank</font>

266
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:26,470
lost all those all those backup tapes

267
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,300
everybody remember that you guys would

268
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,830
know that Iron Mountain was the company

269
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,109
that actually lost the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tapes citibank</font>

270
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,660
just paid someone to do it cool right

271
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,690
nobody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's yeah yeah</font>

272
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,260
reputational risk so just a little flow

273
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,540
chart<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially yes your if you deal</font>

or integrate or integrity of such

338

information so China after our data is

339
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:38,670
that reasonable expectation I as part of

340
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,279
my position with this insurance company

341
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to cool air quoted each</font>

342
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,470
time because yeah I was on the call<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

343
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">was on a call with a hip there's anybody</font>

344
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,300
familiar where they had the American

insurance some<font color="#E5E5E5"> shit apparently it's a</font>

347
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,560
it's a it's the it's a collaboration

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,810
between all private and public health

349
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,839
care systems so the dude from anthem was

350
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,099
on there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dude from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cigna aetna all the</font>

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,360
insurance carriers although big and

353
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,190
large hospitals and one dude actually

354
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,839
one dude<font color="#E5E5E5"> had actually gone as far as to</font>

355
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,110
say I want the government to come and

356
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell me how to secure my data and that's</font>

357
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,540
when I just put the ship on like okay

358
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever I'm going to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

359
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,920
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting when he when he</font>

360
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,720
said that because it was right after the

361
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,930
anthem breach and it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have actually</font>

362
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,100
been the<font color="#E5E5E5"> anthem see so some said it</font>

363
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:36,660
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal but it might have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

364
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:39,870
in really because regulations work real

365
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:43,439
well the other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found I</font>

366
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,290
found slightly way the fuck out there

367
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,820
one guy did mention that the Chinese

368
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,399
Chinese are after<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care data</font>

369
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,620
because healthcare data can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font>

370
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,930
correlate information information on

371
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,820
individuals and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that information</font>

372
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:00,060
can be built it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to build</font>

373
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:03,149
personas and go after set individuals I

374
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,750
don't buy it it's a way to fuck out

375
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,829
there but ok cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah say hip these</font>

376
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,899
are the people protecting your health

377
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:11,219
care data so if you have any type of

378
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:17,149
disease that you don't want anyone

379
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowing about blame them yeah someone</font>

380
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,479
compliance doesn't equal security right

381
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,130
we know this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't anything new so</font>

382
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:30,590
enough boring stuff so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start</font>

383
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:35,960
recording this this never happened this

384
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:38,480
is all theory so Bob's got an idea to

385
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">get his shit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back sitting around the</font>

386
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,410
doctors of the office right doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

387
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:47,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">shit to do looking all sorts of cool</font>

388
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,650
stuff there he sort of put together a

389
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,200
rules of engagement cuz you know Bob's

390
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,120
ethical loves not<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed the street</font>

391
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to steal healthcare data for</font>

392
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,980
meth right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a crackhead so he's</font>

393
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,990
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to steal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any data or there's</font>

the organization no<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit for</font>

396
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoever's not a pen tester here it's a</font>

398
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,740
against machines whatever so no active

399
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,690
no active penetration any facility on

400
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,880
campus is free game which means if they

401
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,020
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lunchroom that's three blocks</font>

402
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,570
away that's connected to their network

403
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,690
it's cool it's it's it's part of the

404
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,369
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engagement make no</font>

405
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,020
determination by single instance and

406
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,458
what that means is if he finds one

407
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,870
instance of something it doesn't

408
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily mean the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system is</font>

409
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:36,139
broken and obviously make it rains the

410
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:40,430
goal right so receptionist<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dumbest</font>

414
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,970
penetration testing before it was a

415
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,200
thing like nobody like we didn't know

416
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,400

awareness training if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

430
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,479
security awareness training in the

431
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,659
organization so they're usually their

432
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,910
first point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> vail so that's an actual</font>

433
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,350
image off the back of a machine at

434
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,890
reception at the

435
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:32,780
major cancer health care campus she was

436
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,860
charging her<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone that's cool school</font>

437
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,530
that means that their ports available

438
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,030
and it's behind the monitor so Bob

439
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,030
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fuck with that he can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

440
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">know put something in there in school so</font>

441
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,910
assuming the risk assessment at this

442
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,100
facility missed the fact that the

443
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,570
receptionist had access to ph I because

444
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,668
you know the receptionist does have the

445
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,470
same medical records as a nurse<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> these these legacy systems are</font>

448
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,689
built so bob was running a pen tester

449
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,600
trying to steal shit from that that's

450
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:06,409
where he would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> stick a USB in there</font>

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">tindie device would ever owned owned and</font>

452
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:13,130
owned Bob would get shell games over

453
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,320
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pen test but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

454

were<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually so I guess they tried to</font>

475
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">build it out right and all of the</font>

476
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,820
systems that had ph I on the wireless

477
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,769
we're using us itself not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ssl is</font>

478
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,799
not breakable but they were using<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl so</font>

479
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:31,659
it's cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> bob said he wasn't going two</font>

483
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:40,870
keys and this is fucked so this was a

year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so before all the TLS bullshit</font>

485
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:47,289
right so it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been even easier</font>

486
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:50,230
let's keep that in mind um so Bob

487

532
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even better so obviously it can use</font>

533
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,030
it can launch it can log into<font color="#E5E5E5"> SharePoint</font>

534
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,439
console I think there's a way I think

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a python that on now for</font>

confluence and its really really

537
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,600
lightweight it's actually a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font>

538
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,730
tool gateway finder obviously to see if

539
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,469
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a way out aircrack for you</font>

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's got plug-ins for the look for</font>

instance that was connecting to so some

559
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:47,379
I might have a slide somewhere how it

about Python you can download the Python

665
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:59,190
shell from pretty much anywhere it's

666
00:28:55,139 --> 00:29:01,080
like six lines of code ninety-nine point

667
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,149
nine nine percent unless they're running

668
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,590
some unless they're running carbon black

seem to not do anything like nothing's

hit escaped twice like it's it's

699
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,860
intuitive some of the newer models have

700
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:33,230
this as well as well as an rj45 and the

LCD output but you know if it was

707
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:59,180
morphine it might be worth it you can

708
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,100
buy one of these for ten bucks connected

709
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,500

780
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,560
to believe its public data which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is cool</font>

781
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,720
right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we as as citizens don't</font>

782
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,730
want it to be public data because you

identifier and it's attached to all

790
