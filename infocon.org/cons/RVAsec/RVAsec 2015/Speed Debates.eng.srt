1
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:22,500
closing punch they can do that it's up

2
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the team's who'd give the closing</font>

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,880
argument and again if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,220
that's fine but it's a good opportunity

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,220
to kind of you know tie things up nicely

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:41,220
the judges<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you we will judge by show</font>

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,409
of applause the instructions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,260
you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to applaud for the team</font>

9
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:48,360
that made the better arguments not the

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,320
team that you necessarily agree with or

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> team that said the funnier things</font>

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,180
sometimes the audience follows those

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,890
suggestions usually they don't there are

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">no prizes so it doesn't really matter</font>

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,210
but that's what you'll do you'll do by

16
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,470
applause and then we'll get I don't know

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,860
if Jake is here or not I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,039
make him I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make Jake stand</font>

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,990
up here and just kind of you know face

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,210
the audience and have it be kind of a

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,579
blind<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wouldn't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who you're</font>

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,570
cheering for right so if he shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

23
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,979
we'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> him come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do that</font>

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,658
otherwise we'll just we'll pick someone

25
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,658
to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because ultimately doesn't</font>

26
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,979
really matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay does that make sense</font>

27
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make sense to you guys since I</font>

28
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:34,439
haven't really outlined that for you

29
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:38,069
before yeah figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you guys</font>

30
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide okay what all right we'll start</font>

31
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:44,240
we'll start over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we'll start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

32
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:44,240
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> and work out how about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that okay</font>

33
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:52,499
you if you want to switch seats feel

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:57,560
free<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a little bit of a</font>

35
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:57,560
background here so plain hacking

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,540
in this morning's keynote if you were

37
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">here you heard Jennifer reiterate</font>

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,270
several times that if you're not

39
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,590
approaching security research within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,370
bounds of the law you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

41
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,470
right and yet none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us really have a</font>

42
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,140
chance of going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ebay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and getting our</font>

43
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,080
hands on an airplane to do a control

44
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:25,339
penetration<font color="#E5E5E5"> test on so what I don't want</font>

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,560
to do is make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this discussion about what</font>

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,540
chris Roberts was or wasn't able to do

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,170
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to</font>

48
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,150
figure that out it's all hearsay what

49
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,859
we're actually going to say is here's

50
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement conducting tests against</font>

51
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,780
live systems is an acceptable way to

52
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,400
create the necessary urgency for

53
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,000
manufacturers to build more secure

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,310
products let's say it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the only</font>

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,810
way says it is an acceptable way to test

56
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,500
against live systems such as ostensibly

57
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:01,700
allegedly the airline thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:04,970
we'll have you guys agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys you guys</font>

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,018
will disagree all right we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

60
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,320
we're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> one minute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of peace</font>

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:14,030
and we'll start with mark wait hold on

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,440
don't start yet okay fine oh yeah I did

63
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,860
say I don't told them they could confer

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,859
all right

65
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,829
don't worry I'm not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give him</font>

66
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,828
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

67
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,370
all right we're starting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

68
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,200
agrees go first anyway and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

69
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">are clearly ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right go i'll tell</font>

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,549
you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're when you're done</font>

71
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:05,320
in-a-gadda-da-vida word up don't get

72
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,840
close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> peak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll use that yeah you go</font>

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,380
you stand the nightstand you don't have

74
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,930
to stand obviously this isn't optimal

75
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,609
but in a world where corporations are

76
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,860
passing the risk on to us and especially

77
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">for something like aircraft I think it's</font>

78
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,970
absolutely mandatory that we do do this

79
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,530
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that responsible</font>

80
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,170
disclosure is suddenly thrown out the

81
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,849
window but personally when I fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

82
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,500
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that the airplane is not</font>

83
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,390
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to be maneuvered by</font>

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,100
somebody sitting in a seat yeah and

85
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">there it I don't know of any other way</font>

86
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,660
to create the necessary urgency then

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,400
actually to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

88
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,630
these vulnerabilities exist because we

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,130
all know we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry they</font>

90
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,500
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to believe it they want to</font>

91
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,240
pass both the cost and the risk on to us

92
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:58,890
as consumers and frankly that's simply

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:58,890
unacceptable<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right anarchy</font>

94
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,420
most of the eastern states of europe are

95
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,060
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things like this if you start</font>

96
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,300
thinking about this where's the where's

97
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line we draw human lives is this</font>

98
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if we can do this with aircraft can</font>

99
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:26,210
we do this in hospitals you know are we

100
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start testing on people we're</font>

101
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:32,590
gonna have dead bodies lining the halls

102
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:38,230
and is that what you want that's on you

103
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:40,369
thank you with 20 seconds to spare you

104
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,000
so what Pete said what's the worst that

105
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">can happen someone dies yeah we're going</font>

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,450
to test live systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> just makes a lot</font>

107
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,520
more sense testing testing live systems

108
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,840
because if you're not researching

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,669
against live systems whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

110
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,619
long what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> be researching against</font>

111
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci scope to find by like hey you</font>

112
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,680
can touch that one box hitting live

113
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,120
systems is the only way to go it's same

114
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,410
way attackers do it when you when an

115
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,760
attacker is looking at something are

116
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,110
they looking in the sandbox know they're

117
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,420
going against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the production system so</font>

118
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,770
it's obvious based on so from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

119
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,820
responsible disclosure perspective it

120
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,070
just makes a lot more sense for us to

121
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,940
test against live systems obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

122
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,219
permission sometimes if you permissions

123
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,540
of permissions that fine line right but

124
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">what source that can happen someone guys</font>

125
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,030
that wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant to happen I think so</font>

126
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,890
conducting tests against live systems

127
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,599
the way i'm reading this question given

128
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,010
the context is the United thing and

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,690
sighed dragon and all that I would

130
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,110
actually interpret this as being without

131
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:44,150
permission you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think from from</font>

132
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,100
like the purity of the test to making

133
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,870
sure what is there gets found like

134
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,980
testing against life systems is the best

135
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,200
way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cuz it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

136
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,640
most accurate result but you know one of

137
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,300
the things that happen when there was

138
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,469
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dude who hacked Mark Zuckerberg</font>

139
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,220
facebook wall a few years back you guys

140
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,050
might remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that obviously it was a</font>

141
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,760
bug right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked the</font>

142
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,700
CEO which means there was a problem that

143
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,680
he found Facebook decided not to pay the

144
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,930
guy and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did</font>

145
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was okay by saying to him all right</font>

146
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,780
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what you went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of the</font>

147
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,910
scope of

148
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,250
what we've actually established as being

149
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:24,000
okay and not okay with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research</font>

150
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,680
community if we're now to reinforce that

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,810
then what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> precedent you know this</font>

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:36,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">is gone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time Pete's point anarchy I</font>

153
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:40,139
don't you let down down so my first

154
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:44,669
question is will this allow us to hack

155
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:47,070
our way out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle seat if it</font>

156
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:50,070
does then I'm all for it Tim knows how

157
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,690
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this live systems what is pen</font>

158
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,460
testing pen testing is against live

159
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,669
systems what's the option testing

160
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,530
against systems in a lab we're all all

161
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:01,890
pen testing is against live systems

162
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,929
that's why we do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so if we're</font>

163
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,729
now obviously we have the question is

164
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,160
whether we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have permission or not that's</font>

165
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,320
a whole different question but in in my

166
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:18,419
mind it's it's a definite<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should</font>

167
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:20,250
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing against a live system so I</font>

168
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,979
wrote software for a living for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

169
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,990
better part of two decades and I'm

170
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,990
actually a pilot so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

171
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,390
stuff the fact is there are ways to

172
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,490
write code and test code before you

173
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,838
deploy code and sometimes they're

174
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,339
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and sometimes they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

175
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,900
and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're getting used and</font>

176
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:46,350
not even in the same device or craft the

177
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:49,650
fact is our industry has grown up and we

178
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:53,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">are now at a stage where screwing around</font>

179
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,620
is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people killed Boris is</font>

180
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,490
right in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that regard I agree with that</font>

181
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:03,630
element of his his argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> the urgency</font>

182
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:06,089
is there and actually this this is

183
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,130
really driven by<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who don't</font>

184
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,750
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power they already have</font>

185
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,250
and the number of people who are

186
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually willing to listen to folks like</font>

187
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,010
you right now today about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,790
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> better this is the argument from</font>

189
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:23,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years ago and we are way past that</font>

190
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,420
now if you don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

191
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,420
cavalry guys

192
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,850
I think the urgency still remains on

193
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,759
getting stuff out the door more than

194
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,899
security so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see your pointed</font>

195
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,610
that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago but I still</font>

196
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:51,410
think there needs to be more pressure

197
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:53,389
applied not everybody cares because part

198
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:57,709
of the problem I mean Australia exists

199
00:09:53,389 --> 00:10:02,269
because of things like this thought

200
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:05,599
you'd want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's the the</font>

201
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:07,310
thing is is that pen testing is against

202
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,509
live systems and of course you can joke

203
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,819
and say what are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to test</font>

204
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:12,740
against dead systems and you know you

205
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:15,769
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take this to absurdity but the point</font>

206
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,189
is is that if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is live and</font>

207
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:23,259
there's lives inside especially there's

208
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:23,259
a time to test in a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to test I</font>

209
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,170
feel like somebody's trolling me or

210
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,819
something with the micro situation but

211
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:45,529
yet it's won't go green<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Jake you</font>

212
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:53,779
here now<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right a volunteer angry</font>

213
00:10:45,529 --> 00:11:00,800
ain't<font color="#E5E5E5"> God who are you pointing to okay</font>

214
00:10:53,779 --> 00:11:01,850
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> front and you're gonna have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

215
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,300
stay up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're going to do</font>

216
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,300
this every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

217
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay remember who do you think made the</font>

218
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,610
better argument that's that's the

219
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,620
question but you don't have to actually

220
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:27,389
cheer for that all right so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

221
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to face the audience okay don't look</font>

222
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:33,499
back keep looking that way who thinks

223
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,498
this team did a better job

224
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:51,560
okay who thinks this team did a better

225
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:56,060
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right very scientific first a</font>

226
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:00,138
second all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right the disagrees have it</font>

227
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,839
stay up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here say stay near the front Sam</font>

228
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:05,029
fries please stay up front and that's

229
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,529
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works I was talking to Jake about</font>

230
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,600
this last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night when I was going to make</font>

231
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,160
him do it before he disappeared and it's

232
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,399
like maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get a app on my phone</font>

233
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,649
that will you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know do the decibel meter</font>

234
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,560
mano he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting tested and I was like</font>

235
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">now that's way to sign gentle way to</font>

236
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:27,349
scientific for this we wait till now to

237
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:28,879
test it really live as nice isn't it

238
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,060
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take turns being first so</font>

239
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,759
Brandon vulnerabilities were heavily

240
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,170
marketed vulnerabilities certainly good

241
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,810
at raising awareness and generating

242
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:44,529
headlines who's heard of heartbleed

243
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:50,449
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> shell-shocked poodle ghost venom</font>

244
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:55,160
so clearly it's good to get in the word

245
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:56,120
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there however in Tim's talk earlier</font>

246
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,399
today he doesn't know I'm doing this

247
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,199
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> game I just wrote this in here</font>

248
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,699
like five minutes ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in his talk</font>

249
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:03,620
with Michelle earlier today they pointed

250
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,240
out that what's hot in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the news is often</font>

251
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,579
not what's most important to your

252
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,050
organization's IT department and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

253
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,819
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own filter on what you</font>

254
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,910
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what's being kind of you know</font>

255
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:16,360
put in your face front by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the media but</font>

256
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,009
do all organizations actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

257
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,449
it's common<font color="#CCCCCC"> to unintentionally allow</font>

258
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:23,120
media coverage to affect the

259
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:25,459
prioritization of IT security task

260
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,709
within your company so the statement

261
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:31,369
today is raising awareness of

262
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:35,329
vulnerabilities via logos branding and

263
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,009
PR campaigns is ultimately beneficial to

264
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:40,550
the security posture of the typical

265
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:43,009
enterprise and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll switch it up so</font>

266
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,930
over there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can agree and over</font>

based on how exciting they are based on

298
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:54,610
on maybe all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong things right</font>

299
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,270
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> our vulnerability is something</font>

that we should market that we should

some buddy who redisclosure at marketing

on an equal level rather than looking at

them based on how their other position

315
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:50,079
what we have to do with security

316
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,850
professionals is actually a marketing

317
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,439
role it's getting the awareness of the

318
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,119
fact that no this is a problem that you

numbers which will be kind of cool but

327

yeah I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in the</font>

the straight face yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put Cyber</font>

342
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,399
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to raise visibility</font>

343
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:51,100
in your it's not the raise visibility

344
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:52,449
until it until it shows up see I can't

345
00:17:51,100 --> 00:18:01,149
even disagree with this thing I really

346
00:17:52,450 --> 00:18:05,039
can I think think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a great idea we</font>

347
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,039
wind up we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disagree</font>

348
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:16,080
so what we're talking about is the

349
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,519
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> posture of a typical enterprise</font>

350
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,590
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here have been in the</font>

351
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:24,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">security role and have had to fight to</font>

352
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:27,269
get a resource how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

353
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">their budget isn't what it should be</font>

354
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:33,159
things have changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> target lost a CEO</font>

355
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:34,720
and a SISO and the boards are starting

356
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,070
to care and the management teams are

357
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,690
starting to care and if you've got a

358
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,210
vulnerability with a logo behind it and

359
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,179
you'll bump into a board member in the

360
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,970
hallway don't be surprised if you might

361
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,580
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get budget now and that</font>

362
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,519
affects the security posture of a

363
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,168
typical enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glad you</font>

364
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:59,740
mentioned target because that's the

365
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:01,539
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of why this is bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dad</font>

366
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,850
not the target had had nothing to do

367
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:05,230
with any marketing crap it had

368
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,789
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with how they had</font>

369
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,470
didn't have their network segmented and

370
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,869
that's the whole problem with this it

371
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,629
lets pinheads prioritize the wrong

372
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:16,119
things it lets them fall for snake oil

373
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:18,039
and it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them prioritize best</font>

374
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:21,189
practices I mean we know target got

375
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:22,720
hacked but hey you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

376
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,919
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think Stuxnet had a</font>

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:32,019
marketing team and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seemed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

378
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:34,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay without that if if you sit like if</font>

379
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:36,279
you're a if you're an executive who

380
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,690
controls budget and security is not high

381
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,850
on your radar if you're potentially

382
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,950
someone who's not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't use the word</font>

383
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,219
pinhead but someone who's not as well

384
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">informed about security as we are having</font>

385
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,549
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> your kids talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font>

386

regardless of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're</font>

388
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:56,259
giving you an informed view on that I

389
00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:00,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">think ultimately is a good thing happy</font>

390
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:04,010
how scary is a picture of a poodle<font color="#E5E5E5"> ruff</font>

391
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey boo though you prepped it for that</font>

392
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,300
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually bitten in the face by a</font>

393
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,900
poodle when I was four years old so

394
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:15,800
there's different I can show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this</font>

395
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,890
car very<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's judging</font>

396
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,030
time come on up<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll make still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> owe do</font>

397
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,330
it next I mean you can sit you can sit

398
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:27,139
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> down after it's good yeah okay</font>

399
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:35,679
ready don't look back who thinks this

400
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:39,400
team did a better job very compelling I

401
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,400
think this team did a better job

402
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:51,150
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough one I don't know what's</font>

403
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:53,130
the verdict number two ought to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

404
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,210
have to actually write it down so I

405
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:59,040
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget all right that's how</font>

406
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,580
forgetful I am troll<font color="#CCCCCC"> group I mean is</font>

407
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:07,409
there like at number<font color="#E5E5E5"> three your acting</font>

408
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,270
is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is for scientific okay this</font>

409
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,070
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like the so like we start out</font>

410
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,840
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of easy and like we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a</font>

411
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,700
little bit more like<font color="#CCCCCC"> in-depth and then</font>

412
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,679
we'll it will go like really easy again

413
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:21,450
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end so another discussion about</font>

414
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:27,600
the law that's that's what you get when

415
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:28,860
you search flickr for cyber war I mean

416
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,419
there's one of the pictures you get when

417
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,219
you search flickr for cyber war these

418
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,070
are all Flickr Creative Commons anyway

419
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,300
so go back this morning again there was

420
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,310
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in the keynote that the lines</font>

421
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,220
are blurring between good and evil and

422
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,649
that's having a direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect on</font>

423
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,330
government regulation on policy and for

424
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,250
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the way that the US Bureau of</font>

00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,950
actually don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it's</font>

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:57,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">wassenaar Boston are Sammy yeah we're</font>

429
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:59,130
gonna say Watson are so who is not

430
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,760
familiar with what's going on in that

431
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:05,070
arena<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay most people are I'll just do</font>

432
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,410
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick so it's a global pact among</font>

433
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,570
41 nation states that oversees export

434
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:14,040
controls on<font color="#E5E5E5"> munitions and arms and in</font>

435
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:16,850
2013 that definition of arms was was

436
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,680
expanded to include intrusion software

437
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,149
intrusion software and so how each

438
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,980
nation state interprets that and

439
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,560
implements the agreement and local laws

440
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,870
is going to vary from country to country

441
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:30,720
so just to set the stage for what

442
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,310
intrusion software is under this

443
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,320
definition software specifically

444
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,780
designed or modified to avoid detection

445
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,550
by monitoring tools or to defeat

446
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,260
protective countermeasures the

447
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,080
extraction of data information from a

448
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,030
computer or network capable device the

449
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,010
modification of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard execution</font>

450
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,750
path of a programmer process in order to

451
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,190
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the execution of externally</font>

452
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,230
provided instructions that's the

453
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,960
definition so because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

454
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,130
arguing about the new

455
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">austin our provisions surrounding the</font>

456
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,330
regulation of quote-unquote intrusion

457
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:06,330
software will<font color="#CCCCCC"> arep release tunt progress</font>

458
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:12,000
in security research so agree so Watson

459
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:20,129
are bad come on you guys were ahead by

460
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:23,700
two Watson are good are you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

461
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,440
to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and say nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

462
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:30,360
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this side which is the agree</font>

463
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:35,149
side who's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go first I probably</font>

464
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:39,928
shouldn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk I've lost two yay um</font>

465
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:41,399
so it in terms of in terms of something

466
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:43,320
security research obviously it's going

467
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:52,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put a damper in what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting can</font>

468
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:58,590
can't do and it just doesn't it we agree

469
00:23:52,559 --> 00:24:00,928
no I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at you good it's bad</font>

470
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,158
it's it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's it's</font>

471
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,539
something that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

472
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring us back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring us</font>

473
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,340
back in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our research capability</font>

474
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:10,649
and it's not gonna it's not gonna it's

475
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,928
gonna Oh Bob's obviously not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

476
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:20,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to do any more cool stuff and yeah</font>

477
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:22,559
no don't so I stand before you having

478
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,960
been a licensed arms exporter because i

479
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:30,658
had a cryptography product the world

480
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:34,470
didn't end we sold product this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

481
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:36,600
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is will it's done progress</font>

482
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:40,529
in security researcher will stunt

483
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,510
progress in people screwing around there

484
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:44,399
was a ban at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> point in the united</font>

485
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">states on radio receivers that could</font>

486
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,120
listen to phone calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there was an</font>

487
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:50,399
exception for technical and maintenance

488
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,529
use in businesses that had a reason to

489
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:56,100
do it so there's every reason to think

490
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you're actually doing this as a</font>

491
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,189
profession<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not doing this hoping not</font>

492
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,470
to be indicted that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't even</font>

493
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,850
notice it because you can look at the

494
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,760
history of things where there have been

495
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,740
restrictions on tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

496
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,420
is there exceptions for the people who

497
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:16,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them in their</font>

498
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:19,220
industry and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a fact I look</font>

499
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,020
at this in the same vein I look at any

500
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,450
pending cyber legislation here in

501
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,820
America and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the people writing it</font>

502
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,790
don't understand our profession and they

503
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,500
just it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they seek</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

504
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,670
limits on us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep the power for</font>

505
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,870
themselves and the knowledge for

506
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,980
themselves in some way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

507
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:43,820
go full Orwellian but that's where it

508
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:45,800
takes me up I don't know that hackers

509
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,870
are going to let legislation stunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

510
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,240
participation<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security research in</font>

511
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,340
the first place the the yeah because we

512
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,890
hurt really thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

513
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,709
with my argument that virus<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that's</font>

514
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,600
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works but yeah we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't follow</font>

515
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">rules in that sense and I think in terms</font>

516
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,639
of any any initial dampening effect as

517
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,919
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the industry has its initial</font>

518
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,960
response to the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being legislated</font>

519
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,420
which is really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big piece of what's</font>

520
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,980
going on in the reaction right now will

521
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,090
will you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

522
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,620
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> two tone risks we'll just</font>

523
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,169
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way around it and if it has</font>

524
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,719
impact on on you know our effectiveness

525
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,890
as and industry that rolls up to the

526
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,780
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll end up making</font>

527
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,640
modifications to it that allow us to

528
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,379
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do our job because they're</font>

529
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:36,200
really smart like that and it's all good

530
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:39,610
I actually agree with what he's saying

531
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,560
but I also covered the data encryption

532
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:45,469
regulations that took place back in the

533
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,690
80s that Bob's talking about and they

534
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,660
were pain in the ass it was a serious it

535
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,520
with serious trouble for encryption

536
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,790
software to be moved where it needs to

537
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,800
be moved it prevented vendors from Duke

538
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,440
from evolving their technology it

539
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,780
prevented technology from getting where

540
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,120
it neat<font color="#CCCCCC"> roots really needed and it</font>

541
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,850
prevented vendors who wanted to abide by

542
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,570
the law from developing the technology

543
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,730
in a way that it that it would have

544
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:16,879
evolved much faster if the regulations

545
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:20,320
hadn't been there so I don't see I don't

546
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,320
see how it could possibly help

547
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:36,270
don't start we live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world where the</font>

548
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,459
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> person can't buy dynamite to</font>

549
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,620
blow up a building that upsets them it's

550
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">just too hard there's regulations for</font>

551
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,090
that it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to get the dynamite</font>

552
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,679
unless you know the right person now

553
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:50,520
we're also coming into a world where

554
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not hard to compile some code to</font>

555
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:58,500
take down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bank it's not hard to get</font>

556
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:01,918
the tools to do large-scale cyber

557
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,740
warfare for the average person now

558
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,169
construction hasn't stopped you know

559
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">mining hasn't stopped just because the</font>

561
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:16,040
you know what has stopped a hell of a

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of deaths think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

um look look how good the cfa is Ben

564
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:38,009
let's see what happens with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

565
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:49,470
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite like the Second Amendment as</font>

00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:53,179
stop gun crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey so there's a there's</font>

567
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:56,129
a word up there it reprobate is

568
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:58,470
important it's part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question will</font>

569
00:28:56,129 --> 00:29:00,299
with this irreparably<font color="#E5E5E5"> stump progress in</font>

570
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,919
security research I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

571
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:04,340
pretty poor estimation of the

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,659
capabilities of people in our industry

573
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,939
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to have any</font>

574
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:11,039
irreparably damage to security research

575
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:16,350
but we might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a situation where</font>

576
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:20,149
whoever's plane just fly sideways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">our key that's coming you do this one</font>

578
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:35,309

579
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:37,669
better argument made by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> team and by</font>

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

581
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:48,450

584
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,530
get at least get a moral victory ok this

585
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,820
is this is the easy one you don't have

to know anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> current news and</font>

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:16,830
I promise you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have an</font>

588
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:19,049
opinion on it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok companies with</font>

589
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,389
a preference for hiring industry

590
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:23,730
certified security practitioners will be

591
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:29,549
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> off in the long run that those</font>

592
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:34,559
than those who don't I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

593
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:36,450
these guys agree let's see if they can

594
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,399
do it let's see if they can do it you

595
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:45,690
guys can disagree I'm like handing this

596
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:47,309
to you on a silver platter<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok you guys</font>

597
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,720
start you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to confer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

have an opinion everybody has an opinion

599
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,190
already yeah okay give us 30 seconds

600
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:21,030
cool so there's there's a report that

601
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,500
came out I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Cisco last year</font>

602
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:26,010
saying that there's a million unfilled

603
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,830
cyber security roles globally right

604
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,809
right now then you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

605
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,600
the DHS or someone came out and said it

606
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:35,730
was 209,000 in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

608
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,030
know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you've got HR you've got</font>

609
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,289
procurement you've got all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

610
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,970
different people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in play in the</font>

611
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:44,580
hiring process that don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

612
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,280
understand what they're looking for and

part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why certifications I think of</font>

vital for the for an organization to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

616
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,010
you're allowing you know basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

617
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,120
baseline<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know you've got all</font>

618
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,980
these different people applying for the

619
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,350
job all right here's your first point of

620
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,429
triage to work out you know the wheat

621
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:07,620
from the chaff in terms of who you

622
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:12,690
wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire I'm the perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

623
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:14,520
of this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just got my cissp and</font>

624
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:18,090
I'm in the marketing department and I

625
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,830
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says it all but the product</font>

626
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,750
but the problem with certifications is

627
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,120
and I know because all i did was cram

628
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,429
cram cram to memorize and study<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

629
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,770
test it doesn't actually teach the

630
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:30,750
critical analytical thinking skills that

631
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:37,799
you need to solve the problems that we

632
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:39,480
face so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't speak to the people that</font>

633
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">cram for their tests at the last minute</font>

634
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,659
but i know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

635
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,250
hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best people in this kind of</font>

industry one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that becomes</font>

637
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:52,080
apparent is that not everybody has the

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,549
same grounding in what has been done

639

before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what's been what's gone</font>

00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:05,730
opportunity to connect those people to

00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,419
that body of<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is bigger</font>

645
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:14,309

<font color="#E5E5E5">their one professor in school so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> passionate about the whole cssp</font>

648
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:20,658

his on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">write to take the test and I think with</font>

enough studying my seven-year-old can

pass a the cissp light CSM maybe the

654
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:39,499
cissp is pretty much the borderline

idiots entrance to security and I don't

656
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:44,059
think you need one to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but as Casey</font>

had said you two have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

with a cissp who's completely brain dead

anybody raise your hands now I know

663

there's more of you we live in a world

things keep live are there going to

676
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,590
there's going to be good certifications

677
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,900
and really bad certifications so you

678
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:03,290
can't put the crucible put them all in

679
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:06,890
the crucible there's it's important that

680
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:13,580
you pick and choose what's right in this

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,189
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I'm gonna let you guys</font>

685
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,940
answer this question which industry has

686
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,890
the greatest requirement for

687
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:40,369
certification as an employment

688
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:43,910
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I heard law government</font>

689
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:48,080
medicine<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and of course</font>

690
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:50,930
marketing and so and which industry has

691
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,220
the highest incidence of security

692
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:58,399
breaches I would argue it's the exact

693
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,259
same same group<font color="#CCCCCC"> GART government</font>

694
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,690
government breaches happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day</font>

695
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,480
government has huge requirements for for

696
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:08,990
industry certifications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

697
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,869
they're arguably the most breached so

698
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:14,709
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is over the long run</font>

699
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,710
sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

700
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,840
I'm doing the ramp up this is a wrap up

702
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,950
wrap up here you see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing</font>

703
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,810
because they know they're wrong you see

704
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,810
how they stumble and all of this

705
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:40,720
certification construction workers you

706
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">know falling down safety</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're crying</font>

707
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:48,320
how many security certifications our
