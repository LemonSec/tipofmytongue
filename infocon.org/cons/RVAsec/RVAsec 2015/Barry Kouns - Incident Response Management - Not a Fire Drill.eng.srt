3
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,040
Coons I'm with her space security my son

4
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,140
Jacob has kind of been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of the</font>

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,050
group little bit he kind of runs and

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,350
organizes and originally founded our be

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,290
a sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> so every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other year or so he'll</font>

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,050
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> submit a presentation and I get</font>

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,129
selected and so here I am for the second

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,199
time and my topic this morning is

11
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:55,530
incident response management and you'll

12
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,690
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone on fire up there I was</font>

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy on fire you know</font>

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">running around his hair on fire but it I</font>

15
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,299
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I shouldn't have that</font>

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,180
graphic so I just stuck with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a phone on</font>

17
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,060
fire because that's not what we want to

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,920
do when it comes to incident management

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,780
so just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you through very</font>

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,720
briefly a quick overview what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,380
cover today you want to have a couple

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,350
slides on basically a disclaimer meaning

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,440
what the topic is and what the topic

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,140
isn't because all of you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,240
different view of what is an incident

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,250
and what does the management of that

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,110
incident mean I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of focus us</font>

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,900
a little bit that will do a poll in the

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous years I try to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little quiz</font>

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,670
see if we go to false quiz and we'll

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,050
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little poll true false then I</font>

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,120
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at do we really need</font>

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:52,020
instead of management you know why who

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,990
cares the language<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition spend more</font>

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,300
time on that so we get on the same page

36
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:02,780
and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how</font>

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,190
risk risk of harm plays into that topic

38
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,479
reporting and Response framework and

39
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,459
then we'll do a little we'll wrap it up

40
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
with some best practices<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's</font>

41
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:15,180
kind of what what we're looking at doing

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,970
I have 50 minutes and I want this as be

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,069
as interactive and sharing as we

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,940
possibly can be if you have a question

45
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:27,358

I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

48
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,130
covered in a slide you know you know in

49

52
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,980
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do we're going to do well</font>

53
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">so good that's what I want please talk</font>

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:55,768
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so a disclaimer I'm not going</font>

55
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,680
to be talking about business<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptions</font>

56
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:03,870
okay which as we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of</font>

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:07,769
security you know CIA or IDs IPS alerts

58
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,170
data corruption scans attempted access

59
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,880
all this kind of stuff log analysis

60
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,349
malicious code that experts in here that

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,530
natural disasters helped us tickets

62
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:22,048
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of attacks and I know there's</font>

63
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,360
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of activity that goes on there but</font>

64
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:29,220
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus this talk on is</font>

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:32,730
potential exposure of pio a pH I<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it</font>

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">really boils down to when when do I have</font>

67
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,070
to notify the quote victims and the

68
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,350
thought process getting to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

69
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:45,239
that's what I'm after here so basically

70
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,040
we're not you know CIA as a part of

71
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,920
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of focusing in on the</font>

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,010
confidentiality side not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,250
automatically generated quote incidents

74
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,480
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pulled this out of a PwC</font>

75
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,480
report forty two point eight million

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,100
incident and I'm wow what what is the

77
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,328
definition of an incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

78
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">using because we collect RBS collects</font>

79
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:16,289
data breach information and we only

80
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,108
collect at about 3,000 data breaches

81
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,329
sometimes we call an incident they got

82
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,030
forty two point eight million they have

83
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:28,229
a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> definition than we do this</font>

84
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,539
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> topic forty two point eight</font>

85
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:33,360
million that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not where we're going to</font>

86
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:36,169
talk about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's get ready</font>

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,360
for a poll anybody know who this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy is</font>

88
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,359
what movie was his name

89
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,349
come I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Commodus right letting</font>

90
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the competence something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

91
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,560
so thumbs up or thumbs down having a

92
00:04:50,740 --> 00:05:00,730
documented<font color="#E5E5E5"> instant response is optional</font>

93
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:04,510
for most organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well</font>

94
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,310
Commodus says no it isn't really

95
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">optional you need to have one in fact</font>

96
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,430
it's like having a will even if you

97
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,130
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got one it may be run</font>

98
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:19,000
by the state or federal government would

99
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:22,420
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have about this one incident</font>

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,180
management process is a support aid not

101
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:30,940
a decision-making tool come on

102
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,190
participate help me okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commodus agrees</font>

103
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,270
with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

104
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:40,240
we go so establishing a team before an

105
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:46,500
incident will have a positive influence

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:49,330
on how they're handled all right exactly

107
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,420
most security experts says it's not a

108
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,950
matter of if your organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

109
00:05:52,420 --> 00:06:00,970
breached but when do we we really

110
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe this right in fact I think I</font>

111
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,240
think Diane in the audience I think I

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,550
took this one from her how about this

113
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are two kinds of organizations</font>

114
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:18,720
those that have been breached and know

115
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:18,720
it and those that don't know it three

116
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:25,990
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be the four</font>

117
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,169
there's ones that are breached they they

118
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:32,080
know it but they don't report it they

119
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,450
look for reasons not to report it as we

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,740
had a conversation last night all right

121
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:45,729
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go speed of response is all that</font>

122
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:48,729
really matters definitely data breaches

123
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:51,270
isn't that why we buy cyber insurance in

124
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,270
the first place

125
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:01,710
how many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those work at organizations</font>

126
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,690
that have cyber insurance policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

127
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,630
the guy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there's a little bit</font>

128
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">i will recommend that if you don't and</font>

129
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">you haven't looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into it you should</font>

130
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,390
suggest looking into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really it's</font>

131
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as expensive as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might think and</font>

132
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,140
the coverage is a reasonably good if you

133
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,940
have any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that you can</font>

134
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,250
see my colleague in go up here in the

135
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,760
front row she's an expert on all that

136
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,150
stuff seriously and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RBS does</font>

137
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,599
not sell cyber insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it slipped okay</font>

138
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,940
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> more oops I gave you the answer</font>

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,420
to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one prevention seems to be a</font>

140
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:43,370
losing battle maybe we should focus our

141
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:47,910
money on detecting response and recovery

142
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,320
I got up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and down in the same row what</font>

143
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,110
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I mean there's no right or</font>

144
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:57,810
wrong answer here but if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

145
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a breach is inevitable and and some of</font>

146
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,940
us don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've been breached</font>

147
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,599
maybe it makes sense anyway I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think yes</font>

148
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:11,790
preparing for something that never

149
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,910
happened is complete waste of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

150
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">right if this and management can impact</font>

151
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,010
the level<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your business your</font>

154
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:30,750
this will kill<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the goal of insert</font>

155
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,599
response is to handle the situation in a

156
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,720
way that limits and reduces recovery

157
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,700
time and costs how can that<font color="#CCCCCC"> be false</font>

158
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,900
right that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta be sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

159
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:45,060
official standard definitions of data

160
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:51,150
breach terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been applied across</font>

161
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:53,040
all industries I mean when people were

162
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,500
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they say we've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incident</font>

163
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,500
what is your definition of incident and

164
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,529
that is a major part of my talk with

165
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,139
today is to try to offer up to you

166
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:09,209
some definitions that are management

167
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:11,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">friendly okay almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left the nature and</font>

severity of unauthorized access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to data</font>

169
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:19,850
should determine their response the

00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:27,180
nature<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> severity of access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to data</font>

171
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:30,420
could determine our response I don't see

172
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,459
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think yes we'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

173
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:37,339
you agree with me at the end an

174
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:42,420
organization can be too quick to notify

175
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:44,490
hurry<font color="#E5E5E5"> up it's all about speed no plane</font>

176
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,529
it yes yes if they can be too quick

177
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,569
that's that's what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we want</font>

178
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:52,559
to say page we kind of warmed up any

179
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:58,229
comments questions any polling anybody

180
00:09:52,559 --> 00:10:00,149
else like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but do do you do I</font>

181
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,550
really need to be concerned with

182
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,860
incident management if you haven't

183
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,930
already been convinced when they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

184
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,569
some numbers here as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

185
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:13,079
risk-based security collects<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

186
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:16,559
this stuff and over the years we've been

187
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:18,719
collecting publicly reported data

188
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,219
breaches and all the information that we

189
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,680
can gather from these you know public

190
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">reports and look at the number of</font>

191
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">records individual records that have</font>

192
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:31,050

193
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:34,079
billion just last year the total number

194
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,089
now is in excess of three billion a lot

195
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,910
and occurs not going in the right

196
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,300
direction you add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that number of</font>

197
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:45,149
incidents and you can see it's also

198
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:49,469
rising significantly and so far this

199
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:53,149
year we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a thousand incidents</font>

200
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:57,149
that we've collected<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 191 million</font>

201
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,980
records have been exposed so this isn't

202
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">going away which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is further supports</font>

203
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,199
everything we agreed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to earlier that</font>

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,740
there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of time before we</font>

205
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:10,649
get breached let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about software</font>

206
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,790
vulnerabilities that's another thing we

207
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:18,060
collect

208
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:19,920
and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these numbers 2006 11,000 it</font>

209
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,270
kind of went down a little and look at

210
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:28,490
the steady<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase since 2011 over</font>

211
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:30,449
13,000 new vulnerabilities exposed

212
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,410
reported however you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

213
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,240
it we're currently tracking well<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

214
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:41,300
121,000 vulnerabilities and by the way

215
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:45,600
for those of you who rely on nvd<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDE</font>

216
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,310
that number equals about 36,000 more

217
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,130
vulnerabilities and they have given<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

218
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,979
CDE number two so there's a big

219
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,439
population of vulnerabilities

220
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,000
vulnerabilities means exploits means

221
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity for you to get breached</font>

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,850
right so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activity</font>

223
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,640
that's pushing us and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course there's</font>

224
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,700
all kind of regulations that require you

225
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,650
to have incident response brief response

226
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,600
notification alerts things like that

227
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,340
regulate our activity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't mean</font>

228
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,710
for you to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read all this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

229
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share with you that you</font>

230
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:26,000
know Health and Human Services grew

231
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:29,730
their scope largest fine ever in 2014

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,850
focus many cyber regulators are focusing

233
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,040
on how prepared you are and how you

234
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,430
respond more so than what you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

235
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,400
prevent cyber insurance as an indicator

236
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,349
of an organization's maturity so they're

237
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,449
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it hey yes you do all these</font>

238
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:50,090
things but in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect the</font>

248
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">is are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of convinced yet that a</font>

data breach is looming and maybe

250
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,340
incident response is something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

251

to do

252

I lovely remember that the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'll see anybody leaving so</font>

258
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,370
we're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> good shape all right now let's</font>

259
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,350
get into some definitions because I

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,820
can't talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about some</font>

distinguishing four levels of a quote

security event issue incident where you

want to call it so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to walk you</font>

with the risk escalating and all the

00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,919
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

304
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,410
our pretty good idea what vulnerability

305
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:08,179
means right it's an existence of a

306
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:11,329
weakness where ever that a desirable

307
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:13,730
event might take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

308
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:15,589
remember you have threats but without

309
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:19,249
being vulnerable to it that threat

310
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:21,919
cannot take take place so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

311
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:25,269
pretty pretty good footing about that a

312
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,009
weakness which allows an attacker right

313
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:30,589
intersection or three things

314
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">susceptibility access and in capability</font>

315
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,899
to exploit all these are good solid

316
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,639
definitions a floor week it's an

317
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:41,619
assistance but really boils down to on

318
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:45,470
vulnerability something has been exposed

319
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:48,589
or is exposed but not necessarily taking

320
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,379
advantage of does that make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

321
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:54,949
be with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and there's less</font>

322
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:59,209
one now here's a couple definitions of

323
00:16:54,949 --> 00:17:02,329
the word incident it's an attempted more

324
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:05,569
successful unauthorized access use etc

325
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:07,908
and so it's a both attempted and

326
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:11,480
successful but is there not a difference

327
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:13,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">between attempted and unsuccessful and</font>

328
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,789
successful I think you'll start seeing

329
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:21,260
where I'm heading here just to separate

330
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:27,079
the various terms situation that might

331
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:28,610
or could lead to various things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

332
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,850
there's a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> or series of all</font>

333
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:35,870
morning expectations followed up with a

334
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:37,939
violation okay then it's kind of you

335
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,580
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a mishmash of different</font>

336
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,860
different definitions in there an event

337
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">which calls an interruption okaying all</font>

338
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,809
of these very solid references have

339
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,759
different variations on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

340
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,220
talk about a breach what is what's the

341
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,889
definition of breach an authorized

342
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,830
movement and it's not authorized to see

343
00:17:55,889 --> 00:18:03,860
the information if I see the information

344
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:07,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that make it a breach hmm maybe a</font>

345
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:10,799
breach of security this comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of you</font>

347
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,899
of you probably familiar with this a

348
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:18,450
very prescriptive requirement here they

349
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:21,570
go to quite a bit creates a substantial

350
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,220
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of identity theft or fraud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

351
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,309
they're starting to talk the language

352
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,379
that I think you know we can deal with

353
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:30,629
and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Florida statue it</font>

354
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:32,730
kind of zeroes in on just computerized

355
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:34,619
data you know there's all kinds of

356
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,039
different definitions all right now

357
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,740
here's what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to see if you</font>

358
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,049
agree with what I call management

359
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,710
friendly definitions of those four terms

360
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:50,940
okay so we'll start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with event notice</font>

361
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,789
the green color it's an occurrence that

362
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,529
has not<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been classified meaning we</font>

363
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:58,289
haven't been analyzed it we don't know

364
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:00,090
somebody said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey I think maybe</font>

365
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:02,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">something happens we don't know so it's</font>

366
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,699
an event because it hasn't been

367
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:10,860
classified as one of the other things

368
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:13,799
okay a vulnerability is an event upon

369
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:18,059
analysis did not result in the exposure

370

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PII pH I but a weakness was</font>

discovered that could have compromised

372
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,259
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's a</font>

373
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,639
vulnerability that has not been

374
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:33,629
exploited incident it's the

375
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:36,178
vulnerability that after analysis did

376
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:39,360
result in reasonable probability of

377
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,980
exposing the data meaning somebody solid

378
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,508
who shouldn't have seen it or they have

379
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:49,460
access to it but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk of harm to an</font>

380
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:54,269
individual has not occurred and in our

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:56,730
judgment is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to occur are you</font>

382
00:19:54,269 --> 00:20:00,179
with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you an example that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

383
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:03,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit because there is a different</font>

384
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:07,830
not all unauthorized the data exposure

385
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:09,689
results in a honest assessment that harm

386
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,610
is going to occur<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the people whose</font>

387
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:15,029
data was exposed can you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity like that they think and</font>

389
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll talk about a little bit now a</font>

390
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,389
breach on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand it is an</font>

391
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,740
incident that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> resulted in the</font>

probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been subject to</font>

393
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,580
unauthorized access so someone who

394
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:34,950
shouldn't have seen it or had access to

395
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:38,399
it has done so and the misuse of that

396
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:42,480
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> has occurred where the risk</font>

397
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:45,658
of harm<font color="#CCCCCC"> to individuals is probable you</font>

398
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:49,399
with me you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference and so</font>

399
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:52,590
these are the definitions that helps

400
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:55,739
managers kind of understand and of

401
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,019
course what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really boils down to we</font>

402
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,200
just walked up this curve right we

403
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:04,710
walked up this curve so because I move

404
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,110
up the curve to breach bigger and worse

405
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,559
things happen more notification has to

406
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:14,549
take place etc more managers need to be

407
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved etc etc the risk of harm to</font>

408
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">individuals is growing and along with</font>

409
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,070
that risk of harm is escalation of

410
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:26,129
notification right up to and including

411
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,619
authorities and regulators and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

412
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:34,590
people it's better this makes sense so

413
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:36,928
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now let's talk about whether</font>

414
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:40,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">or not I want to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion on</font>

415
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:43,590
whether or not risk of harm should play

416
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:45,029
a role in<font color="#E5E5E5"> determining whether or not we</font>

417
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an incident</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't have to</font>

tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody outside our organization</font>

419
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:53,309
about or a breach which we do have to

420
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:55,710
tell and report to individuals you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

421
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:58,259
the letters as everyone here received

422
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,809
one of those notification letters I'd be

423
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,889
really surprised if you hadn't in fact a

424
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,009
little bit we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to walk through</font>

425
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:07,110
one very recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it you get the</font>

426
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:10,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">same feeling out it that I did all right</font>

427
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:13,199
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully of the 47 states now there</font>

428
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:13,820
are 47 states who have data breach

429

notification

430
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,649
lols there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still three states that do</font>

431
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,650
not have laws anybody know who they are

432
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:30,770
nope starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an 80 Alabama South</font>

433
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:34,010
Dakota New Mexico all the other states

434
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:38,030
have some sort of data breach

435
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,980
notification laws but and 40 of those 47

436
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,970
states and here's four years West

437
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:48,770
Virginia puts right in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

438
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:51,920
notification is required only if the

439
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:56,110
entity reasonably<font color="#CCCCCC"> believed the breach</font>

440
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,730
has caused or will cause identity theft

441
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,879
so as an organization that has been

442
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,400
breached I make a judgment of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or</font>

443
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,320
not the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been exposed at</font>

444
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,480
yours whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a chance of</font>

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody using it in a bad way to harm</font>

446
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,890
you I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay forty or</font>

447
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,940
forty seven states have a similar

448
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,760
opportunity for the breached

449
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,860
organization to make a judgment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

450
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,270
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that tell you I mentioned that we</font>

451
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:28,939
collect reported if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have read data</font>

452
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:32,090
breaches there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of bridge</font>

453
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,600
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that through either proper</font>

454
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:37,159
judgment or convenient judgment are not

455
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,980
being reported so it's a tip of the

456
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:45,620
iceberg<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Wisconsin is not required</font>

457
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:49,250
if it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not create a material risk</font>

458
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:51,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay a breach us cause there will cause</font>

459
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:55,310
that's our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commonwealth here in</font>

460
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:57,919
Virginia Arkansas no reasonable

461
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,929
likelihood of harm so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not required</font>

462
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:04,360
so you gives us an out so you need to

463
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:07,400
know that that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a letter</font>

464
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,649
most of these companies regardless of

465
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,840
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says within the letter there is</font>

466
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,790
a reasonable more than reasonable chance

467
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,939
that you could be harmed okay take them

468
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:18,590
seriously and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one utah has</font>

469
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,140
occurred or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> leggett there so you</font>

470
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,419
get you get my point here so this risk

471
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,240
of harm is an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> element that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

472
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,990
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an address within your</font>

473
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,150
incident

474
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,250
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now I'm not suggesting</font>

475
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,500
you take liberties with it I'm saying

476
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,580
you do an honest assessment one that

477
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:40,280
would stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in court is my live you</font>

478
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so here are the a quick quick view</font>

479
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:47,690
of the 40 states in red that have this

480
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,760
harm and the is slapped in those three

481
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,920
yellow ones real quick to say that these

482
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:59,809
guys haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even published a law</font>

483
00:24:51,920 --> 00:25:05,380
requiring anything at this point let's

484
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:09,320
see oh the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that are in white</font>

485
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:12,170
they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have a risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of harm so if</font>

486
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,050
you if your breach is involves a

487
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,929
resident of California it's not giving

488
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:21,200
you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> liberty to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make that judgment so</font>

489
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:24,140
if there's a breach involving California

490
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,490
resident you must report it that's what

491
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,210
it's saying it doesn't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

492
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:34,250
risk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> harm out thank you for the</font>

493
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:36,980
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and even the human health</font>

494
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and human services agrees in terms of</font>

495
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,230
you know the HIPAA you know there needs

496
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:46,220
to be that risk of harm now and in the

497
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:49,400
HIPAA documents looking at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font>

498
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,540
here they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guide you and</font>

499
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,570
what would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reasonable objective</font>

500
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:59,870
judgment okay so identify the nature and

501
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:03,770
extent of the pH I involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

502
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:06,620
not all equal who was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the</font>

503
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,970
unauthorized person that got to solve

504
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the information got to see the</font>

505
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,500
information whether or not it was

506
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,170
actually acquired reviewed and the

507
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,970
extent of which it has been mitigated so

508
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,429
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of guiding you these</font>

509
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,260
minimal things you ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font>

510
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:24,020
before you make the judgment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

511
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,059
there's no likely harm that makes sense

512
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,360
so you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a convenient</font>

513
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:31,010
thing you have to have some backup and I

514
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's for your own own protection</font>

515
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:38,800
as incident response team<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so</font>

516
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:41,679
I'll stop there first a second

517
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,110
does this make sense or I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

518
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,050
communicate a fault process that allows

519
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:49,840
an organization to legitimately assess

520
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:54,040
whether or not the exposure that took

521
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,290
place will harm someone and then based

522
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,260
on that decision escalate the

523
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:02,379
notification okay because that's costly

524
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:06,250
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in a lot of ways okay this</font>

525
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:09,160
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense okay thumbs up oh good thank</font>

526
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,380
you all right now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

527
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,590
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thought process a little bit</font>

528
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:18,370
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we start out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

529
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:22,209
security event report or an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

530
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:26,020
however remember that iceberg thing I

531
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:30,070
was showing you when we cross above<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

532
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">there might be a exposure of pH I or PII</font>

533
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:36,220
that gets reported in to whomever

534
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,689
whoever is responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

535
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,780
thought we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conversation last night</font>

536
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,320
like do you know who you should report

537
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:46,149
such an event to about how many of you

538
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,250
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your work area</font>

539
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,650
and you saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that looked</font>

540
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,800
suspicious in terms of a security event

541
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:58,840
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know exactly who and how</font>

542
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:00,129
to report it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's not bad it kind</font>

543
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,429
of looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little less than</font>

544
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:05,320
half okay now whether or not that's just

545
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,360
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know or that there is</font>

546
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find you know we all know</font>

547
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,750
okay good so anyway a security event

548
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,820
happens it gets to somebody who's trying

549
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:19,600
now to determine whether it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

550
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:21,730
any exposure right and the decision if

551
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,040
the if it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a false alarm</font>

552
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,170
or they didn't know what they were

553
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,649
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about or whatever the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case may</font>

554
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:32,650
be then it just stays an event it gets

555
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:36,490
long it gets tracked etc but it's just

556
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:39,400
an event and that's all we do we stop we

557
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:42,190
log it in we do any corrective action

558
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,520
maybe it's retraining a person or

559
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:48,450
whatever however if there's potential

560
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,250
exposure now it becomes a vulnerability

561
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,540
right base<font color="#CCCCCC"> lennar based on our</font>

562
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,300
definitions

563
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,220
I'm not sure yet but something<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

564
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,590
quite right we got to do some more

565
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,230
analysis now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font>

566
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,030
this like oh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just did analysis but</font>

567
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,260
you all many of you know that that

568
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:10,330
analysis could be painful detailed

569
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,640
requiring forensic experts I'm not

570
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,010
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to downplay that but we need to</font>

571
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,710
understand whether it really was

572
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:20,740
exposure so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say potentially yes</font>

573
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:25,120
there was now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see whether</font>

574
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,350
there was actual exposure was it you see

575
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,110
where I'm done with this right I'm

576
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,959
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it</font>

577
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">was just a vulnerability an example I</font>

578
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,630
was working with the financial

579
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,419
institution and it was reported that

580
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:42,520
when one of our clients logged on to a

581
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,760
particular application not only could

582
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,730
they see their information they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

583
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,760
also see someone else's information you

584
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:54,400
know count information etc that's a

585
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,680
vulnerability through some forensics

586
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,890
we've determined that although that was

587
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,500
a vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no evidence in</font>

588
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:06,160
the logs or anywhere else that anyone

589
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,320
actually did that here with me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

590
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,420
stopped that this was a vulnerability it

591
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,939
needed to be fixed but when there's no

592
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,430
evidence that anyone who shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

593
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:19,060
seen information actually did that's

594
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,740
just one small example this however<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

595
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,879
the same time we could have concluded

596
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,950
yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-and-so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so-and-so were various</font>

597
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,040
institutions they saw something they

598
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:34,060
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now we have it</font>

599
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:37,240
incident you with me Ravana Billy now I

600
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a real life incident that is going</font>

601
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:45,960
to require a risk of harm analysis right

602
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:50,680
let's see are we worried about this if

603
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:52,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is no then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> logged stop do</font>

604
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,710
some corrective action<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're done let's</font>

605
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:58,020
stick with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same financial</font>

606
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:01,570
institution analogy what we found out

607
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:05,379
let's say in this case was that this

608
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:09,250
credit union was able to see that credit

609
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:13,420
unions account information the point

610
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:15,490
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that credit union the risk of harm</font>

611
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,590
of that particular person who has all

612
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights associated that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit union</font>

613
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,090
just happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see one of our members</font>

614
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:25,960
information the risk of that credit

615
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:30,010
union are actually harming our member or

616
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,920
customer was so small that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

617
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,270
breach it just remained an incident does

618
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make sense because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still</font>

619
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:40,990
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same world of governance and</font>

620
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:46,330
compliance had that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> however thats</font>

621
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:49,480
all it been outside you know an outsider

622
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:52,720
we're an unknown individual now we're

623
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,320
into that probability or likelihood<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

624
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,900
misuse does this make sense and now we

625
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,889
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a breach so you see how we kind of</font>

626
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:05,320
escalated and it takes real analysis to

627
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,660
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this and management can</font>

628
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,270
understand and appreciate this and so

629
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,580
we're not as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we get this report</font>

630
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,290
back here we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> start running around</font>

631
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,060
saying we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a security breach or a</font>

632
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,930
security incident no we don't we don't

633
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,879
know yet we got to figure it out in an

634
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,970
honest objective way but we don't know

635
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,490
yet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so therefore we don't run around</font>

636
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:30,160
their hair is on fire and start making

637
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:35,710
notifications to the world because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

638
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:39,900
don't even know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notify okay all</font>

639
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,900
right look

640
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to do that ok so I want to</font>

641
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,260
very quickly go through the various

642
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,080
steps i spent more time on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

643
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,790
chart and covered a lot of this material

644
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,840
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just want to hit so these i'm</font>

645
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,930
going to click through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

646
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,780
boxes real fast so basically under the

647
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:02,960
security event you need to have a

648
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:05,389
requirement to report you need to stop

649
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,280
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it needs to be</font>

650
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:12,020
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to submit a real life organization</font>

651
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">vet reporting is part of the lifeblood</font>

652
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok I've worked with clients is at all we</font>

653
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to have a list of events you</font>

654
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,100
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that awareness out</font>

655
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,500
there right you want everybody looking

656
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:28,580
and so you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it understood</font>

657
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,710
and easy to do potential exposure you've

658
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,409
got to consider all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> various things</font>

659
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,210
you know investigate review articulate

660
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,520
conduct forensics investigation etc

661
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,250
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I went</font>

662
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the flowchart is there a reason</font>

663
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to believe that pH I could have been</font>

664
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:51,400
exposed you know if yes we have the

665
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:55,820
vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok analyzing vulnerability</font>

666
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:58,070
boils down to if yes we have an incident

667
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means interview two systems etc so</font>

668
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,600
all of this this quickly is the analysis

669
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,220
that needs to take place to decide

670
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,830
whether you go to the next level and

671
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will vary based on you know the</font>

672
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:12,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology and technical incident itself</font>

673
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok I'm just going to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through these</font>

674
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:19,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">and of course the bottom line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's</font>

675
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:22,489
a definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a breach and if yes we</font>

676
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:24,529
have a breach again somebody's solid you

677
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:27,830
shouldn't have and there's a good chance

678
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:33,379
that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to misuse it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font>

679
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:36,409
probable alright so now what and again

680
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:40,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I waited to it was declared</font>

681
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">a breach you know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have had</font>

682
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,489
hopefully an incident response team

683
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:48,918
already in place right with potentially

684
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:52,668
a lot of these senior people involved in

685
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it from the CIO to the CEO and or maybe</font>

686
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:57,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just to see</font>

687
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,600
CTO who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> something matter experts</font>

688
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:02,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">human resources maybe somebody from the</font>

689
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,330
business unit operations let's not

690
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:08,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">forget the media people you know</font>

691
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,069
in-house counsel may be outside counsel

692
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,350
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of get to wear one of</font>

693
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">my lessons learned is if you don't have</font>

694
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:17,900
this organized or at least thought

695
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:21,530
through prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trying to deal with an</font>

696
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,080
incident a breach you're in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

697
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,840
trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> right because you won't know who</font>

698
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:30,650
to involve who to talk to who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

699
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:32,510
do what and and then you need to breathe

700
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">because all that information we just</font>

701
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,620
gathered during that process flow

702
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,320
they're going to have to be brought up

703
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:42,049
to speed and again if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these</font>

704
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,270
established definitions and you see how

705
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:49,460
it escalates that conversation is a lot

706
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:51,830
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this makes sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

707
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so in summary this is what I was</font>

708
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:57,830
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work through with you an event</font>

709
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,950
is either unknown<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is yet so they</font>

710
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:04,759
all start out as events if there's no

711
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:06,859
exposure it kind of stays there if there

712
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,360
is potential to exposure we call it a

713
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,540
vulnerability now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving up the</font>

714
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,340
scale if it's an incident there was

715
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,400
exposure but we don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going</font>

there is risk of harm and or harm has

718
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:26,600
occurred then we have a breach okay we

719

739
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:43,759
where is it on the scale it's our event

00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:50,170
right well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think yep among the items</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have at this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we have</font>

744
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:12,200
a vulnerability because we know these

these devices you know password<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font>

the computers are in the hands of

747
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:21,109
somebody we don't know who right so at

748
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:23,630
least we have a vulnerability in my

749
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:28,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">fault process you know because we still</font>

750
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:31,900
don't know but learning more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Heartland</font>

751
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:34,910
suspects that for the computers k

statement we have seen no evidence

wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just somebody in the office you</font>

know rearrange them or they were sent

760
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:03,259
out you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are stolen</font>

761
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,140
computers or they were used in any way

762
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:08,839
and have no reason to<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe anything's</font>

763
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,450
going to happen with you see the

764
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:13,910
language familiar kind of language that

765
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:16,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">we just went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through right so my</font>

766
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:20,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is anybody buying that</font>

767
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:22,240
made you I mean give me a break how

768
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:26,309
would they possibly know that you know

769
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they were stolen by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whom for what</font>

770
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the fact that the computers were</font>

771
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,760
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> password-protected how long is that</font>

772
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:36,339
going to prevent me to get to what's on

773
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,140
that computer well it may prevent me

774
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:40,140
from getting to it but I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font>

775
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">here it wouldn't prevent them at all</font>

776
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what do you think we have at</font>

777
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:49,809
this point what would you as the manager

778
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:56,380
this at response for<font color="#CCCCCC"> heartland what</font>

779
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:58,210
would you be calling this right now it's

780
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,079
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than an event it's more than a</font>

781
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:06,099
vulnerability it's teetering on incident

782
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,650
/ breach right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a fair</font>

783
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:11,589
assessment is I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a breach</font>

784
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,680
here because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

785
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:17,710
know who took it now one way for this

786
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,430
not to be a breach in this scenario is

787
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:23,740
upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> investigation we found out that the</font>

788
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,759
computers went missing but they were

789
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:30,339
taken by another Heartland office you

790
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,789
know without the<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge of management</font>

791
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:35,470
etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so maybe we could have an</font>

792
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident meaning people are looking at</font>

793
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:39,368
data that maybe ought not to but they're

794
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,010
within our system they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

795
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:44,319
misuse it that will be an incident but

796
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:47,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that they were stolen most</font>

797
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:51,220
likely for malicious reasons we have a

798
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:54,849
breach do we agree a break you know got

799
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,169
a breach okay and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just answered that</font>

800
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:59,230
question what would it make it an

801
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:03,849
incident let's do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> back story on</font>

802
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:06,849
on heartland 2008 I think they reported

803
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:09,369
it in 2009 130 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> US credit card</font>

804
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:12,069
and debit cards number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 all time they</font>

805
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:14,079
were number one for many many months but

806
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:18,058
other organizations have stacked up on

807
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:20,650
top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pushing them down a little</font>

808
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">heartland sent a breach notification</font>

809
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:27,520
letter to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2200 people as a result of</font>

810
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:30,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that their information</font>

have been affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by this burglary and</font>

812
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,310
they offering one year<font color="#E5E5E5"> of credit</font>

813
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,170
monitoring from Kroll to those who have

814
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,580
been affected by the incident you sure

815
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:44,140
you all get that right though it's those

816
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:47,170
kind of letters the office that had to

817
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:49,600
theft was a former ovation payroll

818
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:54,010
location one thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary in looking</font>

819
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:57,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heartland not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the payment</font>

820
00:41:54,010 --> 00:42:01,120
cards but they seem to now be acquiring

821
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:03,790
payroll management companies so it's

822
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">even more personal information that</font>

823
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:09,790
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with okay and they're</font>

824
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">their excuses that we hadn't totally</font>

825
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:15,009
integrated them into our into our

826
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,070
security program well they bought them

827
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:20,920
back you know in 2013 so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

828
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:23,650
their time to integrate them into the

829
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,050
program which was mandated on them by

830
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:29,380
virtue of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that big breach back in two</font>

831
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:32,950
thousand eight so not a lot change there

832
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:35,970
and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pick let's look at this</font>

833
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:39,040
notification letter that they published

834
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:41,709
so Heartland get this Heartland was

835
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,660
notified on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8th that your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">information may have been compromised it</font>

837
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,980
almost sounds like somebody else told

838
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:51,700
them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like we discovered it was</font>

839
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:55,110
it's like somebody told us an incident

occurred including<font color="#CCCCCC"> password-protected</font>

842
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,990
normal consumer doesn't understand that

00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,910
password protected computers doesn't do

844
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,319
much in terms of protecting the

845
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,589
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're alluding to</font>

that it does one of these computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

847
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:15,160
have had your information don't you

848
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:20,250
think they ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what was on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

852
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:31,149
eight this is I think June first they

853
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,560
put this out or we have no reason to

854
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything's going to happen again</font>

where innocent response teams are told

because we might have to notify and that
