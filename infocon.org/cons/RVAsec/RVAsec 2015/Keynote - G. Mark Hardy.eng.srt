startup company and all the fun I'm

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,670
having with that although it'd be fun to

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,230
talk about it offline but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,239
what a key notes about it's not about

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">your pet project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey look a little thing</font>

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,729
I'm building up there in the lab but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

23
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,930
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on it for so many</font>

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,800
months and maybe it's going to come out

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,570
but that's not a keynote um it's got to

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,000
be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big picture it's putting</font>

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,979
things into context looking at what it

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,870
is that we are either as a community or

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,850
as a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> or as an event and</font>

30
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,190
trying to stitch that all together and

31
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,929
do it in a way that we kick things off

32
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make something so we all get you</font>

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,010
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something interesting and</font>

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,120
useful anybody was here for Marcus's

35

talk a couple years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how come</font>

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,180

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,460
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said that they were here</font>

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,200

42
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,259

keynote sir he's gonna be sudden death

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,860
because you've just might screw it up

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,330
and then everybody says hey you know the

54

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,819
for us they took us out bar hopping last

59
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,790
way to prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for nine o'clock talk</font>

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,010
at least I didn't get off a plane from

61
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,019
London like your other chief did

62
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,239
yesterday but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you also want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

63
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,170
thought-provoking get you thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

64
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,790
stuff because in a way our community<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

65
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,769
all about coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with great ideas and</font>

66
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,660
implementing them we're not about just

67
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,720
grinding it out this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is not a</font>

68
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,160
sheet metal man or a ship fitters union

69
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,960
where we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead of</font>

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,609
doing that stuff we're thinking we're

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,380
working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brains so trying to get</font>

72
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,930
you to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff some new ideas</font>

73
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,310
we talked about new relationships when

74
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,640
you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cond you have an objective</font>

75
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,580
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends if you're making</font>

76
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,559
contacts do so we're all part of a

77
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,780
community in that community transcends

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the geography of Richmond it goes</font>

79
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,350
nationally and it goes internationally

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,820
if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to travel around</font>

81
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of conferences you</font>

82
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,120
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we are is some big</font>

83
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,829
global community of security experts you

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,030
want some new insights<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to look</font>

85
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">at things a little bit differently</font>

86
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,770
because let's face it it's look at

87
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,940
things the way we've always looked at

88
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,690
him we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

89
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,480
same results and so we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring a</font>

90
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,200
new perspective now I've been doing this

91
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">a while because I know someone's out</font>

92
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,950
here going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reverse engineering ages</font>

93
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,650
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but when I was born</font>

94
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were wheat pennies were still being</font>

95
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,940
made and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a dollar bill it</font>

96
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,459
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue seal was a silver certificate I</font>

97
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,340
mean gee whiz we only had forty-eight

98
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,530
stars on the American flag I mean this

99
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,080
was so long ago the Pentagon only had

100
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,040
three sides okay they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> built the</font>

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,500
other two yet and so as you watch the

102
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,070
industry grow up you see things change

103
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">my first full-time security job you know</font>

104
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,930
not what<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security but before that</font>

105
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,980
was what and it was info SEC and then

106
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,060
computer secure we have all the

107
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,320
different names for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but I've always</font>

108
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,970
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked the word infosec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

109
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of locked in years ago my</font>

110
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,918
first full-time job for real was back in

111
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,079
New York in 1976 or bicentennial year

112
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,760
and I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whopping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two dollars ten</font>

113
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,340
cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour working for the state of</font>

114
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,590
New York plugging all of the security

115
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,140
holes in all the systems that we had

116
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,489
punched as high school kids now granted

117
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,680
this was probably one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the first</font>

118
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good ideas punch a bunch of holes</font>

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,930
in the system and

120
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,340
get hired and paid to plug them and this

121
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,900
is long before the Computer Fraud and

122
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,299
Abuse Act and quite honestly was an

123
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,919
entirely different mindset<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

124
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,720
break into stuff to steal or to do

125
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">damage just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like because you could you</font>

126
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,660
got the door open you said hey look<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

127
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,580
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbor's house all right</font>

128
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,370
let's close<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and relock it because we</font>

129
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,409
like our neighbor today<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little</font>

130
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,210
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggressive out there so I got</font>

131
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,460
to watch her and just grow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

132
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,229
is a really fun thing to be able to do

133
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,489
you know we have these Apple computers

134
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,140
you just hear about that the press the

135
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,670
other day somebody had turned one of

136
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things in and recycling bin</font>

137
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,760
because her husband died and they just

138
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,289
adds out a computer junk so for like two

139
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,909
hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars and their</font>

140
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,280
policy when you turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> in old computers</font>

141
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,530
recycling they'll get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> half to the</font>

142
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">donor or if they can find who it is so</font>

143
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,979
they can't find who it is here's a good

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,400
because you can't trade market number

began and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you what if I</font>

180
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,090
grabbed up a whole bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> names</font>

181
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,020
and by the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was in an era</font>

182
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,030
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> bns before network solutions</font>

183
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,940
because domains were free you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> vet</font>

squatting or domain hoarding nobody

186
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,729
would ever

187
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,260
ever do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what happened I</font>

188
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,200
felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was in California it was</font>

189
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,090
like 1937 your prospecting for gold you

190
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,460
do cool stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find really neat</font>

191
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,599
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but never get around to stake in</font>

192
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,219
the claim and what happens you could

193
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,870
overrun like Custer at Little Bighorn

194
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,850
I'm not about their look at the vendor

195
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,440
space and it always amazes me every year

196
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,180
there's more vendors doing pretty much

197
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,070
the same thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were doing 5 10</font>

15 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago just with a different</font>

199
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,880
twist on it you think we'd be saturated

200
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,410
but no we're not it keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and</font>

201
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,080
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could have been a contender</font>

202
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,680
you know it would have been awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

205
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,940
point is today I get to live down in

our jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't end earlier seven</font>

businesses and organizations they don't

306
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:24,500
land at layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven what happens is they</font>

307
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,960
go beyond listen to layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight and</font>

308
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,310
that's what I wanted to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

309
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,570
because they say is a keynote you kind

310
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:36,410
of think of whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do what</font>

311
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:38,630
is Larry<font color="#CCCCCC"> its politics layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

312
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,660
controls everything below it and you

313
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,310
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you Ray that's true it's just</font>

314
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't talk about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why because</font>

315
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,410
it's outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our sector okay it's in</font>

316
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,740
the maintenance sector we don't see

317
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,750
stuff over there we have office politics

318
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,200
you know every beginning gets along so

319
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,850
nicely in this world but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the most</font>

320
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,270
part of the security world what happens

321
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,620
we tend to be a filk swirl right anybody

322
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,300
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of problem with this</font>

323
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,860
anybody know somebody had a little bit

324
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,490
of problem with this it is actually

325
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that let us</font>

326
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">do what we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do it well because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

327
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,790
rational sane person is going to track

328
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,320
as many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> variables as we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

329
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,420
keep them all up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our head so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

330
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,700
actually an asset but it's tough because

331
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,370
in addition to that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes more of</font>

332
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,480
an introverted personality not<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

333
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,270
but in general if you look at our

334
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,950
community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to find out who are</font>

335
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,060
the ones that we often<font color="#CCCCCC"> see around us</font>

some may be hygienic Lee challenged I

337
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,150
was kind of wondering when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting</font>

338
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,339
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like nobody was sitting with</font>

339
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:43,730
about three rows<font color="#CCCCCC"> of me it's like oh yeah</font>

340
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:45,440
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm okay and in some cases we</font>

341
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,880
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who will almost kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

checked out a society but they're

343
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,500
absolutely brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the key is</font>

344
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,120
is find these brilliant people they

345
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,130
become part of our community we love

346

because this is our comfort zone

technology is where we love it things

351

continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just stay inside the network</font>

more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people wanting to do</font>

363
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,580
startups and that's fun I've done a few

364
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,650
there is a group that's in funded by the

365
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,470
Commonwealth of Virginia called mock 37

366
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,090
they provided me some funding and I they

367
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,860
have rolling admissions Google if you're

368
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,360
interested but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you can kind</font>

369
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,000
of get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that zone but when you</font>

370
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave your comfort zone it gets a little</font>

371
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,390
bit iffy now<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's the thing about that</font>

372
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,920
I submit you don't learn anything inside

373
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,530
your comfort zone there's no growth

374
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,390
there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not challenging</font>

375
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,189
yourself you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what you're used</font>

377
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,710
do and as a result you're not trying

378
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,120
something else and I'm suggesting if you

379
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,640
want to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and get it a layer</font>

380

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else but in general we don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">care we let somebody else handle the</font>

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:30,760
politics of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we tend to look down on</font>

384
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,740
politics right that's a beneath us we're

385
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,370
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to play that game but the</font>

386
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,100
reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's above us it's layer</font>

disconnected to our political leadership

451
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,750
are we seeing a government that's more

452
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,550
responsive or less responsive to the

453

he's got a huge book which you can buy

us on UFOs did a lot of research on he's

486
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,730
absolutely convinced that the government

487
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,730
has suppressed all kinds of information

488
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,080
and his quote that he had put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

his books that he said this actually

<font color="#E5E5E5">it consists of illusion misdirection and</font>

492
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,010
ridicule but the greatest of these is

493
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:48,580
ridicule let me offer you one word

494
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:52,070
modification to that observation and

495
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,639
it's still true look at how whole

496
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,899
politics work today it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing</font>

497
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:59,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of deception going in</font>

498
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:01,189
there and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it remember</font>

499
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,470
son sue anybody ever read The Art of War

501
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,740
warfare is based on deception now I

502
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">would suggest that it's not about</font>

503
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,889
ridicule but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about ridicule I</font>

504
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,570
think Hillary should volunteer her

507
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,149
came out of it but not to make sure they

508
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,559
not to look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm partisan I said</font>

are now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become victims</font>

541
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,429
potentially a political correctness

542
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,190
because we can't do that stuff anymore

543

means<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us is our attack surface we</font>

555
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,959
look at our attack surface as it comes

556
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,190
to networks and we kind of get that and

557
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,010
applications and we get that in

558
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,840

what you pick as your primary calling

795
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,289
why are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after layer eight we</font>

798
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:13,989
as Ben Franklin said if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hang</font>

00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:16,389
together we shall surely hang separately

800
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:18,489
and right now i don't see that

801
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:20,918
unification that we have in our

<font color="#E5E5E5">throw money at us and we somehow think</font>

806
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,468
that we're doing a pretty good job of

807

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing we need to do better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

which goes beyond IT security beyond IT

811
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:46,928
and it goes into society as a whole

812
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:49,989
because as we look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,889
sticks and as I learn from a menu in a

836
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,600
PO folks restaurant many years ago

837
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,210
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on us that never</font>

838
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,480
wrestle with a pig you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get dirty</font>

839
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,520
and the pig likes it and isn't that kind

840
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,130
of describing American politics today

841
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,840
but we've got to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and toughen up</font>

842
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,090
and take a couple the hits because

843
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise we could be playing for very</font>

844
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">very big stakes there are organizations</font>

845
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,140
out there that are stealing information

846
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,300
we know it we know the theft of stuff

847
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,980
that's going on what do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to the</font>

848
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,649
point where end up facing something

849
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,880
seriously like a full-blown<font color="#E5E5E5"> war you</font>

850
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,930
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyberwar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

851
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,580
hello mcfly yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a whole lot going</font>

852
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">on it's all taking place in cyberspace</font>

853
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,149
but doesn't make the headlines because

854
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,450
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really cyber terrorism because</font>

855
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:36,790
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conflict</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do I mean</font>

856
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:38,560
terrorism is traffic and adrenaline<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

857
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,750
when you see a building go down or a

858
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,090
train blow up or somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets shot or</font>

859
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,750
beheaded or whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes the news</font>

860
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:48,399
but networks server administrators being

861
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,310
up till three in the morning rebuilding

862

servers that doesn't make national news

863
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the background it's not</font>

864
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:59,890
as visible now this guy Carl von

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:02,470
Clausewitz who is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> west equivalent of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Sun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soo from the east suppression</font>

867
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:08,260
general and he wrote a<font color="#CCCCCC"> book from Cregan</font>

868
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,960
war and what he stated almost 200 years

869
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:15,280
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that war is a continuation of</font>

870
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:18,550
politics by other means yeah anybody's

871
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,700
we understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so politics is</font>

872
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:23,560
tough and it's dehumanizing and we have

873
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,040
to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take shots when we don't</font>

874
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,470
want to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shots</font>

875
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,940
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go ahead and recognize</font>

876
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,620
we're going to be wrestling with pigs

877
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,330
we're going to get mighty dirty and

878
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,409
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to not learn to</font>

879
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,389
love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to have to go ahead</font>

880
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and at least tolerate it but if you only</font>

881
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,960
tolerate it and don't love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a</font>

882
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,149
passion and so you got to find someone

883
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">who can go off and do that because these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">days are over mr. Smith goes to</font>

885
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,230
Washington the old Frank Capra movie is

886
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:53,630
fiction and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be that</font>

887
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,270
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what we have today is the Lord</font>

888
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,340
of the Flies we are without any direct

00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,560
a whole little you know island with kids

892
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,389
try to organize themselves or we look at

893
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,070
our office politics<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we look at our</font>

894
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,469
corporate politics or we look at our

00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:15,020
state or regional or national politics

896
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,459
it all becomes like that and we as

897
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,570
humans are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to fight</font>

898
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,199
and fight and fight with each other

899
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:23,540
until somebody else takes over all right

900
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,370
hey we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Skynet will be in charge it</font>

901
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,620
isn't science fiction full of these

902
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:31,609
stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> and warnings about what could</font>

903
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:33,199
potentially go wrong we're worried about

904
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,450
China the big boogey man over to the

905
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,418
east now people's republic of china but

906
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:41,569
what 1.3 billion people plus had been

907
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:44,509
isolated from the world from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1842 1972</font>

908
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,679
because the Opium Wars British became

909
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,000
the biggest drug dealers in the history

910
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,500
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mankind but that's a different story</font>

911
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,290
go back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> check your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> history books but</font>

912
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,730
China where you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> little snooze say</font>

913
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,320
well wait a minute we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

914
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">charge of this thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet</font>

915
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,030
and so off they go and so in the United

916
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,230
States we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a legal system and shine</font>

917
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,540
I have a legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> system but what's the</font>

918
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,450
legal system for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world who's in</font>

919
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,540
charge nobody if nobody's in charge is

920
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,129
called anarchy and so it's whatever you

921
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,009
can get away with and of course like

922
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,210
Bart Simpson I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can't</font>

923
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,490
blame me nobody saw and can't prove

924
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:18,110
anything and that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go how</font>

925
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:23,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys do you want to see the</font>

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">future to this group of people there is</font>

927
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,310
a tremendous motions that are going on

928
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,420
different parts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we tend</font>

929
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,400
to think of ourselves to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

930
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">isolated from it but this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

931
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,570
nightmare for many many societies and

932
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,700
parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,910
the spread this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily where</font>

934
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,220
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font>

935
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:44,308
we need to go ahead and engage we need

936
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,839
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved you can't just sit</font>

count you got to get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah get back in</font>

940
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,799
the flake you know I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> already Bell</font>

941
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:57,510
Bell didn't ring that we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back</font>

942
00:35:55,799 --> 00:36:01,770
in there because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lose if</font>

943
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:05,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do not as we heard almost a hundred</font>

944
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:07,500
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago you may not fisted in war but</font>

945
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,538
war is interested in you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've modified</font>

946
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,280
that slightly if politics is an

947
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:12,839
extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> or Wars extension politics by</font>

948
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,020
other means so with apologies to Leon

949
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:18,390
Trotsky but you get the idea you may not

950
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,038
be understood it's interested in you so

951
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:24,029
let's see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> good we are as politicians</font>

952
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man a hero let's do a binary yes</font>

953
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,970
or no yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right never raise your</font>

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand when you're asked to raise your</font>

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:35,160

956
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,859
but I said if we're thinking politically

957
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,140
that's the wrong question what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

958
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:46,288
right question if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking a</font>

959
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:48,480
layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight is is this man useful is he</font>

960
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:51,809
useful for what whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is if you</font>

961
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,119
want to put right that's what we find is

962
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:56,130
we make everything the tool of layer

963
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,660
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're in some way a tool</font>

964
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,270
of layer eight whether we know it or not

965
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,129
and we may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> guided by our own sense of</font>

966
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,319
mission and direction and justice and

967
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,380
purpose but somebody's going to harness

968
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:08,759
that for their own political purposes

969
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,460
and if we're not thinking about layer a

970
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,160
we just become a big pot so let's see if

971
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:17,420
we learn anything what's finish a

972
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:23,490
sentence the enemy of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> enemy is my</font>

1025
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:40,319
focusing on dominating they were just

1026
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:42,960
focusing on surviving to the finish line

1027
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:47,349
so what do you want you want money

1028

1030
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:55,739
anything you can desire is available for

1031
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:59,119
those who play and win at layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:01,700
but wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more</font>

1033
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,980
because we're creating the future and

1034
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Peter Drucker had said the best way to</font>

1037
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,559
Lincoln said that but I think Lincoln

1038
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:14,539
predicted that drukker was going to say

1039
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,490
it and so therefore he went ahead and

1040
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">hinted it that way but we start to find</font>

not education the world's full of

educated derelicts it was persistence

1119
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:34,000
alone is omnipotent its persistence that

1120
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:36,100
gets you going there it makes it happen

<font color="#E5E5E5">to become the prophets of the future</font>

we're going to predict<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future we're</font>

1127
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,440
going to predict<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future more</font>

1128
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,510
accurately than others that was my

1129
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,010
definition when I got my MBA we always

1130
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about what is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prophet oh its</font>

1131
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:58,150
financial it's more gains / losses that

1132
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I says now profit is a result of</font>

00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:03,250
predicting the future more accurately

1134
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,380
than others and then acting on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1135
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,510
so two letter domains are going to be

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,660
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday yes predicted the future</font>

gotta do both but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do both whether</font>

intelligent people's perspective who

00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:47,630
understands the impact of what this

mission that we want to accept lightly

1156

my goodness even Moses go back and look

1166
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,330
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is here instead of going ahead</font>

00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,420
and being a probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up getting</font>

business Connor they have this printed

1178
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,060
as well if you're one step ahead you're

1179
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,730
a leader if you're two steps ahead

1180
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:56,330
you're a visionary and if you're three

steps ahead you're a heretic this has

1217
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,599
fractured and fractious than we've ever

1218
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:24,480
ever been before in American history not

1219
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:28,980
since 1865 when Richmond was the capital

1220

of the Confederate<font color="#CCCCCC"> states but not about</font>

1221
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,609
slavery it's not gender equality racism

<font color="#CCCCCC">even gay rights all these things are</font>

coming and they're being matured and

1224
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,470
we're integrating into society we're

1225
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,079
becoming one where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ought to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

meritocracy but its ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus as</font>

1227
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,579
a cohesive society that we're losing

1228
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:46,558
because many come to America and see it

1229
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:48,539
as a dream and I've talked to people who

1230
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">are immigrants and every time I I get in</font>

1231
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:51,660
a taxi cab because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's weirdly why I</font>

1232
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:53,640
meet people from all over the world I

1233
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,700
say where are you from and why are you

1234
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,589
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and almost universally they're here</font>

1235
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,839
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opportunity that this</font>

1241
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:12,000
America's a threat because we're in
