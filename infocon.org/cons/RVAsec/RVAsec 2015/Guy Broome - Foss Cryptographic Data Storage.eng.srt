implement them actually support them

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,780
fully how can we go about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way</font>

21
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:09,240
that is going to be compliant<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our</font>

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,619

<font color="#E5E5E5">supported within our infrastructure so</font>

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,200
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of background</font>

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,200
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know is for all intents</font>

30
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:31,020
and purposes of state agency we operate

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,940
as a four-year public university you

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,679
know we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of autonomy from the</font>

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commonwealth of Virginia but we are in</font>

34
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,330
effect still estate agency and that

35
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,830
comes with its own set of challenges and

36
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">struggles and difficulties that are</font>

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly unique to our organization that</font>

38
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,300
set us apart from both private secretary

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,880
and public sector businesses that are

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,140
not government agencies one of the

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,640
tricks that we have to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we often</font>

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,009
have to implement some some very very

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">complex intricate and multifaceted</font>

44
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,560
policies on very very minimal budgets

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,240
here you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always that</font>

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,640
there's always that almighty dollar that

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,429
has to be catered to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kept moving</font>

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,750
there so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

49
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,520
what we actually mean here with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:19,080
concept about adding the e first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

51
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,750
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we talking about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eatin the</font>

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,990
e simply put is enterprise management

53
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,500
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about bringing oversight</font>

54
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,220
accountability reliability all to

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,060
enterprise

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:39,540
software right in a free and open source

57
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:43,620
environment so the e simply put is

58
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,929
enterprise management now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk</font>

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">about bringing enterprise management to</font>

60
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,280
free and open source software there are

61
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,240
always some misconceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like to</font>

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,500
float around there that we need to

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,990
address many are you're probably

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,490

here so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so dang well beside me</font>

67
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,420
many of you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably familiar with</font>

the archetype for universe on terrific

72
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,200
misconception quite a bit in my

73
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,369
day-to-day work here somebody hears you

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,200
talking about three dozen source

75
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:27,390
software you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to leave</font>

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,320
it somebody here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about free and</font>

77
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,290
open source software and they

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately develop a certain stereotype</font>

79
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,320
of not only the technician who's

80
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,450
mentioning that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the software</font>

81
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,420
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know linux in</font>

82
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,280
particular kind of grew out a sort of a

basement computing movement and in

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,450
modern our team and though it powers a

87
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,590
they're still kind of its IT perception

88
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,060
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux is still the realm of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

89
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,430
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> the realm of hackers right</font>

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,900
and to a large extent it is but it

91
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,090
doesn't necessarily have to be that way

92
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,280
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring free and open</font>

93
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,230
source systems not too not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just servers</font>

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,549
mind you but clients as well and

95
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:11,220
actually integrate them in with the

96
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:12,959
inner purpose now first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is why</font>

97
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,330
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care we're not talking about</font>

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,910
talking about clients well I don't know

<font color="#E5E5E5">about most of your organization's I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of two hands going up there maybe three</font>

113
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,670
maybe three hands go up there so why do

114
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,229
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about bringing enterprise</font>

the keys to the kingdom there and if you

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,390
enough to have that laptop encrypted

146
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,960
hopefully they were if you don't know

though these Linux client machines and

156
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,640
these free and open-source client

157
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,200
machines represent a very small minority

158
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,539
of client deployments and most

159
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,550
organizations because they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks</font>

them as well

about six months behind how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

time and effort into it and then two

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I go any further does anybody</font>

have any questions any sort of

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,250
clarifications on what I've already

00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:47,509
discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> about bringing enterprise</font>

00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:52,220
involved with that anybody go ahead and

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:59,829
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up hands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have any questions</font>

00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:12,170
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now nope Oh nope no hands alright</font>

347
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:13,459
yes yes say that again correct

348
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,149
predominantly they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

349
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:18,739
distributions particularly in the sense

350
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,120
that its servers you're generally going

351
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,310
to have them secured in data centers

352
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,630
obviously not always but you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

353
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,399
worried about full volume encryption on

354
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,350
a server because it's typically already

355
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,699
behind enough physical security you may

356
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,470
or may not want encrypted swamp that

357
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:32,000
sort of thing but on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your client</font>

358
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">versions on your laptops and maybe even</font>

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,480
in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases on desktops those things</font>

360
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:38,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">are traveling out going to coffee shops</font>

361
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,819
and goodness<font color="#E5E5E5"> only knows where so in this</font>

362
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:42,290
case client<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus of server means does</font>

363
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:44,300
it have physical security doesn't stay

364
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:51,500
put versus does it get up and run

365
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:56,660
frequently in this case my<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

366
00:14:51,500 --> 00:15:00,230
concern is laptops and oh you mean a

367
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,719
client distribution this is developed to

368
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">be cross distribution I specifically</font>

369
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,829
developed a tool that would work on I've

370
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,569
tested it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on fedora open Suzy I've</font>

371
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:13,040
actually done some limited testing on

372
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,880
freebsd debian think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've run a test or</font>

373
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,579
two on centos for it

374
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,930
this part of this requirement up here

375
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,770
was that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want something its</font>

376
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:28,239
distribution specific we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

377
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:31,300
yes I will come to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in just a minute</font>

378
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
here the client-side tool in other words

379
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,189
the tool that actually runs on your

380
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,780
workstations is pure bash script there

381
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,280
are a few third-party programs that

382
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,959
pulls in like an ldap client if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

383
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload key staff directory with the</font>

384
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,040
tool itself is actually a bash script

385
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,390
the great advantage of that is that for

386
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,520
one it's very easy to modify if you need

387
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,650
to tweak it to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own needs not a</font>

388
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,540
whole lot to mess with the other side of

389
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,680
that is that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux</font>

390
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,240
distribution you gets going to have bash

391
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,709
on it you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry about oh</font>

392
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,010
gosh do I have do I have Python

393
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,690
installed the optional reporting server

394
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,800
where clients can actually store their

395
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,070
teens and we'll come to that in a minute

396
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,449
is actually written in airline so let's

397
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,890
actually look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the practical</font>

example here before we go on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

decide here at VCU and VCU<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech services</font>

401
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,210
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be different in your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">organization first thing we had to</font>

403
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,440

<font color="#E5E5E5">support in the case particularly a full</font>

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,790
there's a wide variety of them available

different from what's available on Mac

412
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,010
is different than what's available on

415
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,080
there's a whole plethora of different

text into an algorithm and it spits out

573
00:22:54,979 --> 00:23:00,109
that's another very valid option that's

574
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,519
you all over the place might include an

575
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:02,839
initialization vector that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,099
store<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help return the encryption</font>

577
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:08,899
algorithm or the hash function<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

578
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:10,819
a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> random key as a master</font>

579
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:13,248

00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:14,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">different outer ones right so we send</font>

581
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:15,829
there in we sit there we tend to think

582
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:19,629
okay well we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store the key right</font>

583
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:22,099
not always typically yes but not always

584
00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:24,649
so for any of the architectures and

585
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:29,448
system you considered what actually do

586
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:31,188
you need the story right in our

588

started out very simply very minimal

else to it this bash scripts initial

658
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,170
function was to collect keys from one of

659

two sources either equipped FS which is

a file based encryption method or Lutz /

appropriate permissions within your

701
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,550
Active Directory infrastructure ok so

702
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,080
that was going great

703
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,220
got that client rip up and working it

704
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,110
worked really well we were really happy

705
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it and my boss came back to me and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">he said hey guy what would be really</font>

00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,690
great that's where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped for a</font>

second<font color="#E5E5E5"> I what I don't know here comes oh</font>

709
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:26,590
no it won't be really great we can

710
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,150
collect status on those and have those

711
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines periodically paying back to a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">servant say hey I'm still encrypted</font>

713
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,010
should be pretty straightforward right

714
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:40,000

supports pushing configuration from your

765
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,160

771
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,110
being an open source project itself is

772
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,910
that you have the option<font color="#CCCCCC"> of going in</font>

773
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,830
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seeing exactly what it can</font>

774
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,850
push how it does it and making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

775
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,629
it's eats your needs and if something in

776
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:03,199
there is not for the fifth year

777
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:04,820
institution you can check it and the MLA

778
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,040
server itself also supports a tiered

779
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,230
management approach just like you would

780
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,760
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of any comparable tool where</font>

781
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can define zeros in the web server</font>

782
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,390
which users can recovery keys which

783
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,550
users can it add and remove and delete

784
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,020
machines and so forth and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

785
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:23,389
got a nice tiered layer of privileges

786
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:25,610
there it's a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> detail on Erlang</font>

787
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,720
here since we're a little short on time

788
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:30,428
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this a</font>

789
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:35,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">cover most of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

790
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:38,750
so by earlier standards MLA is a good

791
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:40,360
tool has<font color="#E5E5E5"> central Ott's configuration we</font>

00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,260

centralized reporting all in one place

795
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:52,370
we met that goal right flexible

796
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,540
deployment the client side component is

797
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,320
pure bash that's it it's all you need

798
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got to make sure you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

801
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,270
to have those right flexible appoints

802
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,950
going to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about any limit</font>

803
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,330
sister out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even had a</font>

804
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:11,260
chance to test a few experimental

806
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:20,300
right that's handy it has staying power

807
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,189
the product has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been released under a 3</font>

anybody who wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make changes of</font>

00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,420
welcome i actually have a few

815
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:38,640
personal friends of mine from some very

818
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,280
ensure that it doesn't fizzle into

819
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,350
obscurity and it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

as your particular organization sees fit

826
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,940
so the takeaway from his before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

827
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,409
into this a whole lot further here the

828
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,810
takeaway is as we covered at the

beginning free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source systems</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise do not have to be</font>

831
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,470
second-class citizens there are very

832
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,120
good reasons for ensuring that they're

833
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,130
well supported and fully compliant with

834
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,709
policy and it's not a pipe dream it's

835
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a pie in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sky it's doable we SAT</font>

here wrote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof-of-concept product in</font>

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,430
about four months of casual side work by

00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,689
one developer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could achieve this</font>

goal of managing the encryption on it

840
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:42,870
it's very doable so option one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

841
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,100
just ignore the issue if you have free

00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,330
and source client machines in your

843
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,969
organization you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not policy</font>

844
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:50,520
climbing just<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fine whatever let's</font>

845
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,780
not worry about it walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

an option not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good option but it's an</font>

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:31,230
eventually right and if you do nothing

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">here you're going to have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem you</font>

here which<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be demoing here in a</font>

865
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,450
minute it's just an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> no reason</font>

00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the reason you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use that</font>

867
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can go in there and write your own</font>

868
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,739
it's very doable just a couple months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">due</font>

872
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:57,000
you can go with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing tool cost of</font>

873
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,590
that also reasonably low you just need a

874
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,180
few let four hours to maybe adjust the

875
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,470
product to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization supported</font>

876
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,669
on an ongoing basis make sure to answer

877
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:06,390
users who have questions or concerns

878
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,670
about it right benefit is moderate on

879
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,779
that you get a decent mount of benefit

880
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:14,640
out of it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font>

881
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,470
that your sis admin's get to retain

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,350
their free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source client</font>

883
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,959
devices and you also get to make sure

884
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,569
you're in compliance with policy to win

885
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,150
win provided policies are actually

886
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:33,360
decent but that's neither here nor there

887
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:35,790
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay another option is you can</font>

888
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a new tool as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned you</font>

889
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,090
write your own tool from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground up</font>

890
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,650
in your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization if you can good</font>

891
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,520
look at the examples I've done check

892
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,670
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and say hey this guy's a</font>

893
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,720
terrible programmer he's awful I mean I

894
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,190
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust this guy to tie a shoe</font>

895
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,569
laces let alone let alone write an

896
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,850
encryption management system let's go

897
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:54,660
and ride around that's fine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

898
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,830
that the advantage there right you're

899
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,779
going to get a tool that's custom

900
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,880
tailored to your organization it's going

901
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come at a fairly high cost</font>

902
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,710
particularly if you want to do a

903
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,350
professionally developed product and

904
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,670
dedicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> full-time employees to it labor</font>

905
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,250
our whole nine yards they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get very</font>

906
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,870
costly but it's also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good</font>

907
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,600
benefit your organization it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

908
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:15,080
be custom tailored to your needs right

909
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,220
it's going to do what you want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

910
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,480
there's also the added advantage of not

911
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,520
having to ask anybody else if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

912
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,540
need support with it hopefully you'll

913
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,460
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your developers right there in the</font>

914
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,600
organization provide a bitch followed

915
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,930
some lifecycle management like we

916
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:32,190
discussed in the previous presentation

917
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:33,750
right future directions with him away we

918
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,040
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly do some improved server</font>

919
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:39,120
authentication right at the moment

920
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">malays authentication to the server is</font>

921
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,529
fairly rudimentary both to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MLA</font>

922
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,660
server at supplant Active Directory

923
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,800
standard ldap and HTTP I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

924
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly like to implement a REST</font>

925
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,530
API for the MLA server portion right

926
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">also implement client configuration</font>

927
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,470
right now all of the tools are in the

928
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,120
server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client script to make</font>

929
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,100
this happen

930
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,109
but that client configuration particular

931
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,180
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux gets very distribution specific</font>

932
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,530
right I think kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

933
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,460
witcha touching on earlier is how in the

934
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,810
world we address this client

935
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,970
configuration in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform neutral</font>

936
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,410
way the client configuration opponent

937
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,480
all the communication pieces are there

938
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,910
but the logic action needs to be fleshed

939
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,620
out to make this happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

940
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution at the moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">redhat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suzy and debian right because i'm</font>

943
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,680
only one developer but all the

944
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,000
communication is there to implement what

945
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:36,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need on other other systems as well</font>

946
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:38,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right need to support more operating</font>

947
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,370
systems there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no reason in</font>

948
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,569
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could</font>

949
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this tool and use it on</font>

950
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:46,220
Windows Windows has power shell and most

951
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,569
of the business versions now Power Cells

952
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,629
definitely not bash but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

953
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,160
functionality out of it uploading<font color="#CCCCCC"> keast</font>

954
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,070
active directory is substantially easier

955
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">from windows for obvious reasons right</font>

956
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,910
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible you can actually</font>

957
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,350
court<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool windows and have all of</font>

958
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:07,160
your clients manage their encryption

959
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:09,620
managed under one roof throw this out

960
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,899
there i am not a developer or a

961
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,270
programmer by trade especially and

962
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,070
particularly not a web developer right

963
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,200
and this will become very evident in a

964
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:24,100
few minutes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see this very</font>

965
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:29,990
clearly so the web face is full<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5</font>

966
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:31,400
validated themed in CSS right so I would

967
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,779
eventually like to also see it get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

968
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,960
more themes on here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe look a</font>

969
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:39,620
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional but be that</font>

970
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,260
as it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh and finally the build</font>

971
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,160
process those of you who<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised your</font>

972
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,390
hands and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you've dealt with their</font>

973
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,299
lane before have any of you ever messed

974
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,799
with OTP the build procedures and the

975
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,130
the system development integration

976
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,920
process they are laying particularly for

977
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:57,520
the server components the Erlang build

978
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:02,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution process dates back to</font>

979
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,620
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory serves the early 80s so it's</font>

980
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,790
kind of a relic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a dinosaur and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

981
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,819
would really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to get away from and</font>

982
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,590
get to more modern distribution methods

983
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,779
like actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> gene you make files and so</font>

984
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,759
forth

985
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:14,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright power is yours now if you folks</font>

986
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:16,249
will give me a moment here to get some

987
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:18,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">setup and a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a little bit</font>

988
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:19,819
of preparation done hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do</font>

989
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:21,109
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do the live demo here and then</font>

990
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:22,819
we'll conclude the presentation there

991
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,049

DM crypt under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hood to do its full</font>

1001
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:01,880
volume encryption there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no</font>

1002
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:03,499
reason whatsoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> this could not be</font>

1003
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,289
ported at least the client portion to an

1004
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:07,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android application it would be a</font>

1005
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:09,049
challenge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be work but it's</font>

1006
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,559
definitely doable there's nothing

1007
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,559
precluding it

1008
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,820
and what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing at the moment is I'm</font>

1009
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually firing up the MLA server</font>

1010
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,470
component of this on a remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

1011
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,180
ok so we're component appears to be up

1012
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,049
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually verify in my local sign</font>

1013
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,950
that it's working here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I'll</font>

1014
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you guys what that looks like</font>

1015
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,840
we're might on time here we got five yep

1016
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,839
just enough time to finish this up here

1017
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,630
right

1018
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,520
so get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here</font>

1019
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the server</font>

1020
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:29,660
component looks like it's actually not

1021
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,540
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this local machine it's live</font>

1022
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,040
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a machine elsewhere NBC user network</font>

1023
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,900
right few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may notice up there</font>

1024
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,299
that HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> f is not enabled at the moment</font>

1025
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I carrying around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> selfs on ca's</font>

1026
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:41,720
with me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to adjust them</font>

1027
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:45,589
provides demos it tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause a live</font>

1028
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,140
demo failure right and as I mentioned

1029
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:58,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't be too harsh on on the</font>

1030
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:59,450
styling and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot they're right you</font>

1031
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,910
going to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very simple interface</font>

1032
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,960
for the MLA server component home page

1033
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,450
with the brief landing little bit of

1034
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,980
info list of computers obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1035
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:09,169
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the databases we just initialize</font>

1036
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,140
the server for the first time and a user

1037
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and group management portal right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

1038
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,500
so good nothing in there terribly

1039
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,940
complicated there's a new user function

1040
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,309
password changes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there three groups</font>

1041
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,630
admit admins or folks who can do

1042
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:22,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything on the server adding removing</font>

1043
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:26,240
computers adding removing ball yours the

1044
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,470
whole nine yards key recovery or people

1045
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,750
who can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in there and view</font>

1046
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,368
the encryption keys themselves and the

1047
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,290
regular users category are folks who can

1048
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:35,030
just go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> see which machines are</font>

1049
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,170
reporting and the reporting status but

1050
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,790
can't otherwise be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the encryption</font>

1051
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:39,230
material so it has a tiered approach

1052
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:42,230
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to what Active Directory</font>

1053
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:43,849
uses for its key management<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

1054
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,990
and as we mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are no</font>

1055
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:48,010
computers in there at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment since</font>

1056
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,009
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just initialize the server</font>

1057
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:59,130
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so anybody have</font>

1058
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:00,450
any questions about the web interface

1059
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,769
before we move on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run the</font>

1060
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,839
client script and get these keys and

1061
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:06,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">active directory in the web interface</font>

1062
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:09,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's actually move on</font>

1063
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:10,828
and this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really have to keep</font>

1064
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:13,339
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> fingers crossed and hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that nothing</font>

1065
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:13,339
explodes

1066
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,859
we get a font on there that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

1067
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,859
bit legible for you guys

1068
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,310
you
