using commercial cloud computing

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:58,480
capabilities like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon and Google</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aser</font>

the identifying and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to</font>

mitigate the changes and impacts of

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,350
their operational components as well how

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,660
they do their jobs around a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,580
and it's this talk kind of distills out

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,190
a lot of the the large kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher</font>

agility and rapid deployment continuous

this and continuous that and no one's

30
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,350
talking really about security aside from

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,149
class cloud secure can I trust the

32
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,770
vendor you know you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the cloud</font>

33
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:43,330
it's not secure all this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,429
everything's leaked and breached and

35
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,509
that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of the</font>

36
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">genesis of where this talk is coming</font>

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">from as a bit of background for my</font>

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,830
perspective I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should be</font>

39
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:02,740
embracing cloud computing and to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

40
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:06,459
say why is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's marketing</font>

41
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:10,869
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> right who here has a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix</font>

vertical integration kind of model is is

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,090
moving rapidly into computing and I'll

47
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,820
I'll touch on a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

48
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,620
specific things I think in conversations

49
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,909
with lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and legal teens and</font>

50
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,470
looks like that that really changes the

51
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:38,200
tenor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how stuffs approached market</font>

52
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,180
realities obviously you can't turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,069
corner in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT world right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

54
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,950
seeing cloud this software as a service

55
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,179
that infrastructure this Amazon made a

56
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,190
huge splash with their earnings

60
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,450
right it's you can fight it in your own

61
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:00,069
organizations you're probably not going

62

they think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need security is kind of</font>

the awesome new data center they just

built or all of the colocation space

75
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:37,000
they filled with gear right basically

<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody is doing that anymore as time</font>

something that fails that's a huge

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,608
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can do it instead in the</font>

94
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,989
cloud in a few minutes and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs you</font>

95
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:21,969
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred bucks to find out that</font>

96
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,330
that experiment is a failure that's a

97
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,960
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can do lots of those and</font>

98
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:31,030
mature much quicker and finally from a

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,580
steamrolling perspective companies big

100
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">software vendors are pushing all of</font>

101
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">their software to be cloud centric or</font>

cloud

103
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,859
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe the exchange Microsoft</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Exchange road map ends at 2020 and</font>

105
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,710
beyond that they're shifting to a full

106
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,290
as a service delivery model right that

107
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,840
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> change between now and then but</font>

108
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,280
lots of lots of large organizations are

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,219
shifting is that their their predominant

110
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,138
focus there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of upside for them</font>

111
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">there right it's continuous revenue</font>

112
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,400
instead of buying software licenses once

113
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,280
and then holding on to them like Windows

114
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,080
XP license XP when it came out and and

115
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,090
companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get off of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of life now for a while so there's</font>

118
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,460
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot there to kind of show this</font>

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,860
is to kind of set the stage cloud is not

120
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,590
going away you can fighting it is is

121
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,450
kind of tilting at windmills so rather

122
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">than fighting it I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font>

embrace<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and more importantly I would</font>

124
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,100
be willing to bet a pretty decent amount

125
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,419
of money that every organization

mantra for as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I've been in IT</font>

155
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,740
direction but you still see flash stuff

156
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,109

157

158
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,599
so in the same fashion cloud computing

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,430
infrastructure platform software as a

160

number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are already</font>

approval or knowledge but they're there

169
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:19,409
so as a security community<font color="#E5E5E5"> as security</font>

170
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,849
practitioners rather than fighting it I

171
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:23,759
think we should choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adapt and</font>

172
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:25,740
adapt smartly to the challenges and the

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,300
opportunities that moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a cloud</font>

174
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:35,039
computing capabilities bring how we do

175
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,830
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is choose carefully don't</font>

176
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,090
let their lawyers pick your vendors

177
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,900
vendor selection is probably the single

178
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">most important component of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you</font>

179
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,280
do with the commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud right so</font>

180
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this is the big difference</font>

181
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">between buying software that you're</font>

183
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,180
of stuff and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do whatever you</font>

185

186
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,039
in the cloud you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

187
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,508
what that vendor brings to the table and

188
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,400
in my experience ironically enough if

189
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,740
your vendor is willing to negotiate

190
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,090
significantly on their capabilities on

191
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,490
their terms of service on their nests

192
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,900
la's you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run screaming</font>

193
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,490
from that vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that means</font>

194
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,799
they're not really operating their cloud

195
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,310
in an automated large-scale fashion

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're they're a small boutique you</font>

197
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know who knows if they'll be in business</font>

198
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,050
in a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years none of the tier 1</font>

199
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,169
vendors whether that's Google Microsoft

200
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,580
Amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> softlayer VMware they don't</font>

201
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,919
negotiate<font color="#E5E5E5"> SLA is they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> negotiate</font>

202
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,870
pricing for the most part there's some

203
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,000
scale volume discounts and things like

204
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,589
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but by and large the only way their</font>

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,570
businesses exists the only way they make

206
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:42,029
their margins is through absolutely

207
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,300
regulating automation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime there's</font>

208
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:49,079
one off changes that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

209
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,180
entire system into into disarray so I've

210
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,930
got three kind of major points around

211
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,170
event

212
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,870
selection without getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into into</font>

213
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,360
specific organizational details the

214
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,300
first is is indicators of success right

215
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,220
so dealing with federal government I

216
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,290
spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font>

217
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,970
to admit going through compliance

218
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,849
reports and looking at compliance

219
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,380
artifacts and things like that

220
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,410
compliance looking at the compliance

221
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,050
status of various vendors I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a firm</font>

222
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,240
believer that compliance is king right

223
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,250
so you've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA audit or a sock</font>

224
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,050
one or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft too and that means you're</font>

225
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,760
secure however the organizational

226
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,339
maturity required to go through those

227
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,350
audits in the first place tells a lot

228
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,899
about your organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so I</font>

229
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider a large number of those</font>

230
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,610
security audits as security compliance

231
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,290
reports and perspectives to be

232
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,000
indicators of success in the same way

233
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,620
that weird DNS traffic and things like

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> indicators</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of compromise right</font>

235
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,910
this is the flip side of the coin being

236
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table and say that</font>

237
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,939
you've been audited by four or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

238
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,620
independent entities and that you're

239
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing what you say you're doing is</font>

240
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,250
that's the important part right that the

241
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,279
audit doesn't say you're secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> audits</font>

242
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,930
generally say that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in fact doing</font>

243
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,220
what your advertising doing what you're

244
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,449
selling and that kind of thing that's

245
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,880
kind of the whole purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind like</font>

246
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,580
the the sock audit stuff specifically

247
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,470
for service organizations I think that's

248
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,709
that's critical and that's something if

249
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,140
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market space a huge</font>

250
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:21,180
number of vendors haven't even dip their

251
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,839
toe into anything maybe beyond PCI DSS

252
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:27,029
right so who can<font color="#E5E5E5"> support HIPAA data you</font>

253
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,550
know who's willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign a baa that</font>

254
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,220
includes liability for breach if the

255
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:38,550
gifting in the damages on their part of

256
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the equation beyond that the SLA terms I</font>

257
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,890
have had so many conversations around

258
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,690
people within<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own data centers</font>

259
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,400
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> its best effort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you buy a</font>

260
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,220

263
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,050
build a system that will be online and

264
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,240
sustainable and operational for whatever

265
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,459
your goal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your assistant happens to</font>

266
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,810
be those same people flip around and

267
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,000
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cloud service provider and</font>

268
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,890
immediately jump to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

270
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:14,150
good enough or you know amazon offers me

271
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:16,760
99.95 but google offers me 99.99<font color="#E5E5E5"> five so</font>

272
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">google is obviously a better service or</font>

my overall system needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you</font>

277
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,650
thing for infrastructure as a service

278
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,480
specifically I think it's kind of

279
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,980
ridiculous to look at s la's from

280
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,970
vendors as anything other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than an</font>

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,820
estimate of the mean time between

282

failure so in the same way that you

283
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,750
build with raid and redundant<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

288
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,160
should be read as an MTBF so you

289
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,290
engineer your solution around<font color="#E5E5E5"> those SLA</font>

290
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,060
s as they're presented to reach what

291
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,520
your actual business goals are so if you

292
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,170
need five nines of uptime none of the

293
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,630
cloud vendors provide anything at five

294
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,819
nines so does that mean you can't build

295
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,060
on them no it just means you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

296
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,620
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> according to their fault isolation</font>

297
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,000
capabilities and combine those in the

298
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,180
appropriate fashion which requires

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,290
really knowing how<font color="#E5E5E5"> your infrastructure</font>

300
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,729
provider actually works finally is is

301
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,500
don't let your lawyers get wrapped

302
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,150
around the terms and conditions<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

303
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,930
larger company the harder this is going

304
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:35,140
to be the lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the federal</font>

305
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,030
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really fun for this stuff</font>

306
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically most of the cloud providers</font>

307
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,770
have anti indemnity clauses all kinds of

308
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,930
stuff the indemnity thing is has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a</font>

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">constant source of pain and suffering in</font>

310
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,459
in my life<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the last few years</font>

311
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically Amazon and Microsoft and</font>

312
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,089
Google and soft layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and beyond all of</font>

313
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,070
the vendors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with</font>

314
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,780
all have a clause that says that you

315
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreed to indemnify them from any</font>

316
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:04,100
damages that occur because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your use</font>

317
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:06,110
of their systems lawyers hate that right

318
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,210
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge risk for your your</font>

319
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,970
organization to have to indemnify and

320
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">pay the legal costs of a third party</font>

321
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,940
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> no cap</font>

322
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,430
well after doing a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of digging</font>

323
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,890
it turns out that the power company and

324
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,650
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank terms of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service for bank</font>

325
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:26,160
accounts have the exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> same terms and</font>

326
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:29,220
conditions in them so do you negotiate

327
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,839
your your power bill with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dominion power</font>

328
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,390
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you negotiate your terms of service</font>

329
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,280
with them no<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually their terms of</font>

330
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,770
service are are less restrictive than

331
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,480
then even most of the cloud vendors they

332
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,120
got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra up there there might</font>

333
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,770
be an eye chart but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dominion</font>

334
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,850
power says<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll make a best effort to</font>

335
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,380
provide what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say we're going to</font>

337
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:53,520
anything beyond that so you know do with

338
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">it what you will so when thinking about</font>

339
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,410
cloud computing and thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

340
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,180
that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of approach to things you know</font>

341
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,800
build with and treat them<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Lego</font>

342
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,569
blocks treat them like<font color="#E5E5E5"> components in</font>

343
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,069
your own infrastructure and put them

344
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">together in a way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense and</font>

345
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,370
meets your needs rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

346
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,860
force your needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivered as a is</font>

347
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,740
a fixed solution at you know negotiating

348
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,270
a bespoke customs kind of thing when was

349
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,520
the last time you negotiated custom hard

350
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,840
drive delivery right you maybe you need

351
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,980
70 800 rpms instead of 7200 that nobody

352
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,920
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks that way in the hardware</font>

353
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,750
space moving your existing

354
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,550
infrastructure kind of composite

355
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,010
thinking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clouds basic it serves</font>

356
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,810
a lot of folks really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's that's</font>

357
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,060
true at scale as well so when you talk

358
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk to folks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix who are</font>

359
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,229
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're organizationally famous</font>

360
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,000
for being a huge huge cloud you know

361
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,570
their entire operation runs on AWS at

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,010
this point that's that's effectively the

363
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,770
same approach that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking right</font>

364
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,600
they they chaos monkey chaos army all

365
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,140
that kind of stuff is used to help

366
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,690
enforce their their approach to

367
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,260
stability and failure modes between AWS

368
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,260
components

369
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:12,270
so beyond that to adapt and adopt

370
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,370
smartly it helps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of the new</font>

371
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,500
threats right so cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> computing does</font>

372
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,740
have security challenges associated with

373
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,390
it it also has all of the same roughly

374
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking all of the same security</font>

375
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,530
challenges that your existing computing

376
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,900
infrastructure has right so if you're

377
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">running an insecure wordpress on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Prem</font>

378
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,220
and you move that to the cloud odds are

379
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,080
your cloud vendor is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

380
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,710
path of attack that leads to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system</font>

381
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,370
being compromised so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big four that</font>

382
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,380
I've seen from starting at the top

383
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,170
likelihood<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually impact your</font>

384
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,930
operational capability moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font>

385
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,490
stack and then starting at the bottom

386
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,430
the amount of marketing and vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> fud</font>

387
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,490
you'll see about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of inversely</font>

388
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,920
correlated here CSP account current

389
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,990
pneus so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

390
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,280
big scary things right if you forget to

391
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay your bill if you're not on a</font>

392
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">purchase order agreement arrangement</font>

393
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,390
with your your CSP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you forget or</font>

394
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,099
your credit card expires and the person

395
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,660
had the the master account for the

396
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,430
vendor has left the company so that

397
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,040
credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no longer there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

398
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,050
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to contact you anymore</font>

399
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,209
the vendors will just kill all of your

400
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,890
stuff right some of them have grace

401
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,900
periods some of them have the ability to

402
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:29,640
recover after you know up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

403
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,500

a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working with with the</font>

405
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,370
vendors I've seen this occurred at all

406
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,140
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't it's you know luckily</font>

communications to to fight that problem

412
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,100
so making sure your accounts are current

413
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,650
making sure that the vendor has ways to

414
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,240
contact you that kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

415
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,970
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cannot happen in your</font>

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,129
they come to repo it you know or they'll

420
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,830
they'll come and visit you in demand

421
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,750
payment or something like that versus

422
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:14,189
just having it all just disappear one

423
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:15,900
afternoon business stability this is

424
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be I think a bigger issue</font>

425
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:23,889
moving

426
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:26,589
forward so Gartner has issued some Lydia

long from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gartner's the VP who runs</font>

their infrastructure as a service magic

quadrant and some of the cloud stuff

430
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,480
there Gartner she said through through

months that this year and next year she

433
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,179
sees the cloud market space

434
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,909
consolidating<font color="#E5E5E5"> and collapsing a rapid</font>

435
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:45,070
fashion she's gotten lots of vendors

436
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:47,590
coming in asking how do we exit the

437
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,200
cloud business who should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sell to how</font>

438
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,370
does you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing work</font>

439
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,019
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult from an</font>

440
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,330
infrastructure service perspective it's

441
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,190
incredibly difficult to compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

442
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,699
likes of amazon and microsoft and IBM

443
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,990
right amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> is doing so at a profit so</font>

444
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,850
they announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> their earnings last</font>

448
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:11,519
profitable on their actual cloud

449
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">operations so there's a lot of</font>

450
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,549
accounting work that's done to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're you're making tons of</font>

453
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,460
you're losing a hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> over fist or you're</font>

455
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,019
a big issue what you don't want is to

456
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:28,330
get caught out as a consumer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

457
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:30,870
cloud services so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another kind</font>

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">of going back to indicators of success</font>

459
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,739
cloud computing capabilities that are

460
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,659
delivered<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the main focus of the</font>

461
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,720
company I think will generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

462
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:43,210
much much greater chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being a</font>

463
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,909
stable long-term capability that you can

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,230
use versus cloud computing capabilities

465
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:49,659
that are spun up sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of as a side</font>

467
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:57,009
they're doing so for instance HP and IBM

HP IBM and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google have all in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:17,990
you know there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their terms</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be around in in two years or anything</font>

479
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,939
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> NHP said they're getting out</font>

focusing entirely on hybrid cloud so

482
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,840
it's you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that become</font>

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,010
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of terrifying if if you would put</font>

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,410
into HP and looking at that as a public

486
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,030
cloud offering and you have to step<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

487
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:46,700
and really really kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on there CSP insider threat is is the</font>

third this goes back again to indicators

490
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,600
of success looking at folks looking at

491
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,800
companies that have been through audits

492
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,530
looking at companies that have been

494
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,990
from a u.s. perspective looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSPs</font>

495
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:10,340
that have been through FedRAMP and have

been through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DoD FedRAMP guidelines</font>

post federal guidelines those audits all

enforce some form of background check

sophistication so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just random</font>

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,970
folks they're hiring off the street who

threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> very as dramatically as the</font>

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:38,570
offering to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the vendors so</font>

506
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,370
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in audits for a bunch</font>

507
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,100
of the tier 1 vendors and even at the

508
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,928
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very upper end of the scale there's</font>

509
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,209
huge differences in how they how they

510
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,880
all counteract that the insider threat

511
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,280
risk they all take it extremely

512
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,110
seriously at that end<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

513
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,200
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key indicators of success in</font>

514
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,909
those audits that's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

515
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,059
biggest threat the federal government's

516
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:04,910
working working around is is in their

517
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:07,280
use of commercial cloud computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

518
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,420
there no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> government employees</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

519
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,520
direct government contractors

520
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,340
necessarily who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the data</font>

521
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,160
centers and systems so learning kind of

522
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,750
what your CSP does and then there are

523
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,890
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do to mitigate CSP</font>

524
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,200
insider threat as well that

525
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,210
in a little bit things like encrypting

526
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,200
your data when it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud that</font>

527
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,680
can sort of minimize even a malicious

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">CSP administrate or something like that</font>

529
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,750
finally there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are new technical attacks</font>

530
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,639
has anybody seen anything in the

531
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:45,000
literature about a hypervisor attack

532
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:46,860
against a tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 CSP exactly right so is</font>

533
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,310
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible yes well it probably</font>

534
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,169
happened yes we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on AWS has been</font>

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the better part of eight</font>

protecting these infrastructures that

540

obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> at no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point do I think anybody</font>

that it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's not an issue</font>

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:18,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">however I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's nearly as big</font>

of an issue as basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else</font>

546
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,239
we've talked about so there there's a

547
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,690
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fear uncertainty and doubt some</font>

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> non cloud providing infrastructure</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">running your own data centers because</font>

552
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,850
that's more secure when realistically

553
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,889
speaking you still have the same

554
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:41,610
technical threats on their stuff in your

555

data center as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well multi-tenancy is</font>

556
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,550
probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base differentiator there</font>

557
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:56,130
part of adapting means saying goodbye to

558
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:58,710
things right so there's a lot of stuff

559
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,870
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the largest lessons</font>

560
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,100
learned over the last four years there's

561
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,989
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ready to let go out from the security</font>

563
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,690
perspective that I see entrenched in

564
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:12,510
most large organizations the first one

565
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:16,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the intense focus on network</font>

566
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,910
intrusion detection ah people look at me

567

<font color="#CCCCCC">like I've got my head screwed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

568
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,970
backwards sometimes I go I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't buy gigamon or what have</font>

00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:33,350
security bolt on passive doesn't exist

648
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,409
in the cloud effectively so your

security devices and your appliances and

650
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:39,409

passiveness part goes away<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font>

660
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,430
security bolt on architecture and you

664
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,480
part of the data passing path right so

00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,770
they're active layer 3 and above

intrusion prevention systems kind of

678
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,189
goes away when you move into a CSP

679
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,930
environment you really if they may be

680

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that under the covers from their</font>

visibility of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your on your own so how do</font>

687
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:15,040
you do that so if all of your tools are

688
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:16,790
gone how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> work the old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adair is</font>

689
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,750
security has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be part of your</font>

690
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:22,100
architecture so moving into and this is

691
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,780
predominantly for infrastructure

692
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,429
platform as a service capability

693
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">software as a service i'll talk about in</font>

694
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:30,980
a second you really have to start

695
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,170
looking at how you bake security into

696
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,880
the products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're fielding rather</font>

697
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,770
than assuming you can put them behind

698
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,500
layers and layers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> racks and racks of</font>

699
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,480
appliances that that magically remove

700
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,690
threats from getting to them via the

701
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,640
network right there's all kinds of new

702
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,090
capabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole section here</font>

703
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,850
in a second we'll cover those failure is

704
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:56,899
much easier to design for so the concept

705
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:59,000
of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflix does with chaos army and</font>

unplugging stuff

710
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:08,190
can your operations survive that

711
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:10,168
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking no that's incredibly</font>

712
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,869
complicated and difficult to build in a

713
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:15,690
physical data center on most of the

714
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:17,340
cloud providers it's pretty easy it's

715
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy to manage it's easy to track it's</font>

716
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,199
easy to build as long as your

717
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:25,019

727
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:51,210
basically everything you need from a

728
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:53,279
security perspective virtually

729
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,960
everything you need is generated in the

730
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,869
logs of your applications and servers

731

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you read the literature and</font>

00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,470
look around at all of the breaches that

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:13,649
discovery and data forensics occurs

739
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,529
through log analysis not through looking

at peak apps pcap sometimes help but

741
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:20,519
generally speaking it's long analysis

742
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:21,928
when someone's attempting a sequel you

743
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,129
know sequel injection or cross-site

744
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,379

745

that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate you know 500</font>

747
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,998
like there's warning signs before

748
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:34,289
attacks occur there's surveillance stuff

749
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:37,200
that you can pick up that's all in the

750
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:39,600
all in your log files right learning to

751
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,549
focus you know stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> staring at peak apps</font>

and start staring at application logs

753
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:48,899
and I think it did anybody see Dave

767
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,750
and look at whether their flags for

have very methodical processes around

1048
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,520
handle a lot of incident response type

1049

stuff whether it's from law enforcement

1050

or organizations who are hosting things

that bad wordpress install drupal

1052
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,200
install that kind of thing most so the

1053
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,790
vendors will know kind of you know they

00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,610
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really actually kind of amazing how</font>

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">much their automation and not just</font>

vice versa and again this goes back to

indicators of success for for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:19,779
you're already trusting them with the

entire do you know of the operations of

1082

those systems and the data in them so

1083
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:29,009
encryption doesn't really prevent your

CSP from getting your data in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a panacea although</font>

1101
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:13,390
is a significant operational headache

00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:15,640
it's also a source of pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> right beyond</font>

1103
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,750
the headache if it breaks you lost your

whole system you're restoring from

1105

backup so it's really a you know there

1106
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,950
may be systems where that is justified

1107
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,078
you have good backups and that that is

you know your critical you whether it's

piii cardholder data something like that

inside of my head any questions the

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was also a vulnerability in it was</font>

only work on single<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU cores with no</font>

other processes running or they only

work there's there's a lot of stuff

00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:02,950
especially reading reading literature
