1
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,869
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> plant I'm like you guys you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

2
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,460
I think that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and it</font>

3
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:27,880
applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it applies to people I</font>

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,489
care about the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> landscape for info</font>

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,439
SEC and I'm really I appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

6
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,720
being here because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is such</font>

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,600
an important conversation so I'm really

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">glad that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this and I</font>

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,769
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be surprised and</font>

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,269
some of the stuff that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

11
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:49,600
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today it's not surprising but it's</font>

12
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:51,909
important so this just came out this

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,290
quote was just in the Washington Post

14
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:59,140
the other day the assistant director for

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the FBI's counterterrorism division told</font>

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,720
Homeland Security that's the challenge

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,759
working with those companies to build

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,630
technical solutions to prevent

19
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:15,100
encryption above<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this is the</font>

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:19,320
ecosystem we're in right now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:22,479
scary because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama also just said this</font>

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,658
we want cyber criminals to feel the full

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,970
force of American justice because they

24
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:30,250
are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much damage if not war as</font>

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,039
folks involved in more conventional

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,909
crime now I show solitary confinement

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,729
here because hackers get that kevin

28
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:43,420
Mitnick we've they both ended up in

29
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:46,030
solitary now you know they may have

30
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">provoked the guards a little bit maybe</font>

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,799
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would but</font>

32
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:56,770
nonetheless this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ecosystem that</font>

33
00:01:50,799 --> 00:02:00,580
we're in right now Obama<font color="#E5E5E5"> has actually</font>

34
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:03,070
proposed doing some changes to the laws

35
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:07,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government has been using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

36
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:10,389
prosecute hackers and he is suggested

37
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,599
expanding the definitions that could be

38
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:16,689
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prosecute cyber criminals I put</font>

39
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,670
cyber criminals in quotes because to the

00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:20,970
government to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> judges to the people</font>

41
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,660
who end up judging these court cases

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,220
things like changing a URL is a hack you

43
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,170
know two people who are less technically

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,670
sophisticated

45
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:35,488
the kind of stuff you and I do every day

46
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like really advanced hacking this is</font>

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,130
a good about the Computer Fraud and

48
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,470
Abuse Act this is the act that ends up

49
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:48,359
putting away people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitnick and</font>

50
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,870
we've the problem is it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> constructed</font>

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,030
many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and what's legal is</font>

52
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,750
unauthorized access now that can be

53
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,600
interpreted just really really broadly

54
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:04,980
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem no one knows what it</font>

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">means and Nate Cardozo from the eff the</font>

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,340
whole everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the eff is really</font>

57
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,160
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the changes that Obama is</font>

58
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,650
proposing and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cardozo said under</font>

59
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new proposal sharing their each view</font>

60
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password with the friends would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

61
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,239
felony<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's true and that's the</font>

62
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason why these laws worry me is</font>

63
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,540
because pretty much everyone here breaks

64
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,040
them almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day just doing the</font>

65
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,310
things that normal people do with

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,500
computers and with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end or not so</font>

67
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,200
what ends up happening is these laws are

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,170
used to punish people for political

69
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,268
dissent have folks here have been

70
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">following the Silk Road trial a little</font>

71
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:51,060
bit yeah so I you guys probably saw the

72
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:53,940
sentencing for the founder now Rob

73
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Graham wrote about this and she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,570
that we should find this outrageous we

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,600
should be outraged and I think he's

76
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,510
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually kind of outraged this</font>

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,780
is me like outraged I don't express it

78
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,790
very much

79
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a CEO and I've kind of learned to</font>

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,160
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything like under the surface</font>

81
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,019
so I don't you know scare off people

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,048
from working with me or with my company

83
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had a co-founder who got fired for</font>

84
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,030
seeing some sensitive things on Twitter

85
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,650
so I've kind of learned to keep some of

86
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,690
my outrage under wraps this is like his

87
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,310
outrage does it get right here thank you

88
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:35,850
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> letting me share this much outrage</font>

89
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:38,880
with you today no that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

90
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,990
extremely satisfying thank you we can do

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end we could all break</font>

92
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,350
pencils so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,210
in these slides and I apologize for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

94
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,890
it's because I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought all this</font>

95
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,830
language from the courts was so so

96
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,469
important I just couldn't cut it all out

97
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,770
so what the judge said here with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

98
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,530
sentencing about silk road is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

99
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what the Silk Road founder</font>

100
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,150
did was criminal but that it was

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
political dissent he was saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

102
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,640
laws governing drugs and the

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,100
marketplaces were wrong and his

104
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">punishment was very excessive for that</font>

105
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,370
reason so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the judges quote</font>

106
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,740
the state of purpose of the Silk Road

107
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,540
was to be beyond the law this is deeply

108
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,660
troubling terribly misguided<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very</font>

109
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">dangerous and she gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him a bigger</font>

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,160
sentence than even what the prosecution

111
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,520
had asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is the reason</font>

112
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that she gave whereas Ross told the</font>

113
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,940
judge I wanted to empower people to make

114
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">choices to privacy in anonymity I'm not</font>

115
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,919
a sociopath so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of see myself</font>

116
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,250
in front of the court<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday seeing</font>

117
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,650
this about you know why I made an end to

118
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,080
end encrypted at I'm making this<font color="#CCCCCC"> app</font>

119
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,000
right now that is a way for people who

120
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,760
are cannabis activists or second Rights

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,950
Amendment activists<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have large</font>

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,140
conversations amongst themselves like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred thousand people and have it be</font>

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,570
anxious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very worried about</font>

127
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,299
applications that prevent the FBI from

128
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,940
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to intercept them so</font>

129
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,479
oh I don't know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read this and I</font>

130
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,650
relate to it and that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why</font>

131
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,650
I'm anxious and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

132
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave the country because it's nice here</font>

133
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:34,739
but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

134
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,400
because this is what I do and I want to

135
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">live in a relatively free country right</font>

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,818
now we're free enough that I can have

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,680
this conversation so that those are the

138
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,560
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm thinking about right now</font>

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,650
now isn't this cute Ross<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so cute with</font>

140
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,379
the kitten I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> Business Insider so</font>

141
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,690
Business Insider is not like a high tech

142
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:01,129
blog or security blog so I thought it

143
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:04,169
was really meaningful that this writer

144
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:06,930
did this piece about how his sentencing

145
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,090
was too harsh it's like a mainstream

146
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,860
thing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who's watching</font>

147
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:17,580
this and and has some understanding if

148
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,830
the ecosystem can see it his sentencing

149
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,630
you know you deserve some kind of a

150
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,729
sentence they had a lot of evidence and

151
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">he broke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the law but it was extremely</font>

152
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:32,190
harsh so one reasonable response is just

153
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,800
like I'm out do folks here know who

154
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:38,550
Quinn<font color="#CCCCCC"> norden is do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys know who she</font>

155
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,370
is a few people but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> affront so Quinn</font>

156
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,800
warden is this security researcher who's

157
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,509
really good at embedding herself into

158
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">communities so she's gotten to know a</font>

159
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:51,029
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hacker communities you know</font>

160
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,650
anonymous and<font color="#E5E5E5"> aaron schwartz and she got</font>

161
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:56,310
really tight with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those folks</font>

162
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,948
and ended up handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of sensitive</font>

163
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,650
data like stolen credit card type stuff

164
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,259
in her efforts to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

165
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,020
security journalist and she wrote this

166
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,930
post recently saying we should all step

167
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,419
back from security journalism and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

168
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,979
go first this was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a watershed</font>

169
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,979
moment this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time that</font>

170
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,419
someone really<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out and said it's</font>

171
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,729
too dangerous and I don't want to do

172
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,590
this anymore and it was interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

173
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,960
see Quinn do this because Quinn is

174
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,789
different from someone like kevin

175
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,370
Mitnick or

176
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,630
we've or someone founding Silk Road

177
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,789
because Quinn is a journalist in Quinn

178
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,549
has been very careful to not break the

179
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,159
law and Quinn isn't even a hacker she's

180
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:44,300
not even the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one creating the</font>

181
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:47,360
vulnerabilities or breaking in and

182
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,839
getting the data she's just analyzing it

183
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,880
and sorting out truth from fiction and

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,490
then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring that to the light</font>

185
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,189
to the public what she said is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I may be</font>

186
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,070
incarcerated for doing my job and she

187
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:03,380
said I have a family which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> wild she's</font>

188
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:08,450
like as a family I can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this scary</font>

189
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,640
journalism stuff wow what and this was

190
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,620
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to Barrett Brown because</font>

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,330
Barrett Brown was sentenced to six to

192
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,580
three months just for linking to have to

193
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,290
material<font color="#E5E5E5"> no Barrett Brown was involved</font>

194
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,650
in anonymous Barrett Brown has all of

195
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,709
this context that added to his sentence

196
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,290
because political dissidents your social

197
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,050
graph all of that plays into intention

198
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,000
which plays into your sentencing but the

199
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,359
actual crime he committed was pasting a

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,730
link and for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Quinn who</font>

201
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,500
shares information in the process of

202
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,780
being a journalist that's worrisome and

203
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,030
for me that's worrisome to because

204
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,400
piecing a link is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy thing to</font>

205
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,079
do right like I drink too much Saturday

206
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,600
night and I go on twitter i can post all

207
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,980
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and usually it's all</font>

208
00:09:50,600 --> 00:10:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">right but the stakes are high so i need</font>

209
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:03,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch myself now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of</font>

210
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">text but what Quinn nerd and said is</font>

211
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,760
that the government is chilling the

212
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,510
basic techniques that we're using in

213
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,150
security research and in journalism

214
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:19,010
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's happening is if you paste</font>

215
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,470
a link if you share this data that black

216
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,920
hat hackers have got it then it's as if

217
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:29,860
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day to yourself and and</font>

218
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,790
that that's that's very chilling for

219
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,620
journalists and it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

220
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,199
security researchers to think about as

221
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,010
well I was actually thinking about

222
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,020
Jennifer earlier I tweeted about you

223
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,400
you have good lawyers because of what

224
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what your company does and</font>

225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,430
unique of lawyers it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

226
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,100
with like advice or takeaways here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

227
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,109
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of that but I have a</font>

228
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,960
lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same law</font>

229
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,720
firm that defended leave and they're

230
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,910
helping me just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know file on my</font>

231
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,800
expert controls and I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of</font>

232
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,810
hackers is being kind of like the Mafia

233
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,270
these days or like they get the Mafia

234
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,130
for a tax evasion and they could get me

235
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,790
for like failing to file my expert

236
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,520
controls or something if they wanted to

237
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,069
I also worry because I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

238
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,870
careful about my social graph like we

239
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,870
will post often all comments on it

240
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,420
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like funny or interesting I</font>

241
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,070
could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that showing up in court if I</font>

242
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,430
were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more careful I would</font>

243
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:38,050
like only<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly talked to really nice</font>

244
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:39,069
people but I don't know I I wasn't

245
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,050
raised the way I haven't lived the way

246
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:45,130
up until now it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

247
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,839
of mindset for me to say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

248
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,490
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what my court case would</font>

249
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,400
look like if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> in trouble for</font>

250
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,070
building the encryption because that's

251
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,150
scary and illegal now it's not illegal

252
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:01,810
yet but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> foreseeable it it could be</font>

253
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:04,600
it could happen I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

254
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,479
interesting but so I hang out in Silicon

255
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:12,970
Valley a lot and there's a certain

256
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:16,450
arrogance there now this CEO had it hit

257
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,090
him run so he smashed<font color="#E5E5E5"> him one up in her</font>

258
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:22,510
car and she had some significant

259
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:25,030
injuries he did it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font>

260
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeding he couldn't wait he couldn't</font>

261
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait for the slow driver so he cut her</font>

262
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,160
off and there was this accident and he

263
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,840
didn't have any jail time she didn't die

264
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,600
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but like you can actually</font>

265
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:41,170
in a hit-and-run and just get community

266
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,700
service if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the right contest so</font>

267
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,490
what the judge said is that he's

268
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,170
basically a good citizen so he doesn't

269
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,500
even need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the jail time that would</font>

270
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,890
norm

271
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:54,040
happen in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit and run because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

272
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:56,760
good citizenship so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

273
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,790
terribly surprising for everyone but for

274
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,350
me it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just a reminder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

275
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,849
disappearance of good citizenship and

276
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,530
the other stuff that goes on behind the

277
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,180
scenes right like his company raised

278
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,490
something like a million dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred</font>

279
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:14,589
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars so those kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

280
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:17,770
resources can be helpful again you know

281
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:20,890
what are the takeaways here for me it's

282
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a reminder that activism and</font>

283
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:26,980
dissidents as well as truly and

284
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,589
embarrassing the FBI and the government

285
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,460
end up being like the real crimes

286
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,770
because with the vagueness of the laws

287
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on the books right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

288
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,030
everybody violates these laws in one way

289
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,390
or another you share<font color="#CCCCCC"> your HBO Go</font>

290
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:45,939
password and that's already like fuzzy

291
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:50,020
so it's really the broader context of

292
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:53,050
whether you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like politically</font>

293
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:56,140
challenging things like Silk Road Silk

294
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:59,650
Road was asserting that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketplaces</font>

295
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:02,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">around drugs the marketplaces around our</font>

296
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,510
transaction should be different so what

297
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">can you do one thing you can do is file</font>

298
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,860
a Freedom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Information Act request and</font>

299
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,710
then you'll see like what the government

300
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,470
has about you which i think is useful

301
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,600
and interesting and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually will</font>

302
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,430
send you stuff they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> black out a lot</font>

303
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,740
of it and you can send it to different

304
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,189
agencies and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in touch with</font>

305
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:26,830
me if you want to file your FOIA request

306
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:30,610
so I think of we have a lot when I think

307
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:32,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because he got jailed for</font>

308
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,230
that AT&T hack which was essentially

309
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,800
just changing links so is this iconic

310
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,600
case where it wasn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hack like</font>

311
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:47,500
changing a link isn't that big a deal

312
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:50,380
anyone can change a leg and I wasn't

313
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">trata</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this top right I was like I</font>

314
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,750
don't know what to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say like these are</font>

315
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:58,360
just bad info SEC is dangerous during

316
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,230
our Indian he's like don't see well okay

317
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,709
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

318
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:07,199
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suggestion maybe next</font>

319
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,118
time the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants it I don't know</font>

320
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,579
I can bring it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on my phone we got</font>

321
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:15,869
time so I thought I'd end with this and

322
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,949
then we'll do some Q&A and some

323
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:23,369
discussion and mix it up which is you

324
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:26,219
know say what you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me but I'm</font>

325
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:28,649
always grateful that he actually fought

326
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,899
this case because we don't want that

327
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:34,230
accumulation of case law saying that you

328
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,699
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put people like us away for you</font>

329
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,709
know changing links and then sharing

330
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the newspaper we really need</font>

331
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,920
for that stuff to be legal and I don't

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,179
think I even need to tell everyone here

333
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,860
in the audience why we need security

334
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">research and disclosure to be legal so</font>

335
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,970
I'm always appreciative that that got

336
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,378
overturned and I think it's impressive

337
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:59,009
that you have returned it from jail so

338
00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:01,619
you know worst case if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you end up in</font>

339
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">prison and i hope none of you do please</font>

340
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:06,600
fight it because we really can't have

341
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,719
that accumulation of case law showing

342
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,720
that it's legit to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> people away for</font>

343
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:19,049
this stuff now I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my last</font>

344
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:21,329
slide yep cool so I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

345
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:23,730
kind of interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

346
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:25,079
you're so just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys know a lot</font>

347
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,240
about this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> new some really</font>

348
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,290
interesting stories probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> an insights</font>

349
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,519
I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be interesting to</font>

350
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:34,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">open it up a bit more in do more QA and</font>

351
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,850
conversation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if everyone</font>

352
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:42,360
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah ok so I'm going to kind</font>

353
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,709
of move on in and we've got folks in the

354
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,110
back a load of snow and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

355
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:49,439
close up at a time does anyone have

356
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:53,459
questions or like a story that is

357
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:58,649
relevant to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yeah</font>

358
00:16:53,459 --> 00:17:06,059
I have not and that's because I'm not

359
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">very successful let's wait ask me in</font>

360
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:14,908
like six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a year yeah I the way</font>

361
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:17,099
what I'm doing is following silent

362
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:19,470
circle's model right now where we just

363
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,089
delete everything and that's what the

364
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,529
government is really worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is</font>

365
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,809
like they approach you and technically

366
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:26,520
you just don't have records or like sent

367
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">and encrypted and we deleted all of it</font>

368
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,918
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what to give you when I</font>

369
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,139
end up doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure storage from our</font>

370
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,450
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes then we'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

371
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,710
hand that over but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm presuming no</font>

372
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,220
one's doing anything terribly

373
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,899
interesting in their small companies but

374
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,299
I don't know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know people do all</font>

375
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:48,418
kinds of crazy illegal business

376
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,279
transactions so we'll get exciting i

377
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,309
can't wait and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm ready to leave the</font>

378
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:56,130
country so I run this startup with my

379
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:59,610
ex-husband who's a goat herder uh and

380
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,260
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> back when we expatriated and we</font>

381
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,750
lived in the Middle East for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while so</font>

382
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,809
like everybody's ready to just like pick

383
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:11,580
up and go but I do like it here so I'm

384
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:14,250
hoping I'm hoping we don't have to but

385
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:19,529
you can ask me about goat hurting other

386
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:22,399
people had questions or thoughts don't

387
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,399
be sad not shy

388
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:31,610
that's good question the security

389
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:33,889
researcher is usually generating the

390
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,229
data like I have a lot of questions

391
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:38,360
about uber the company and how they're

392
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,919
handling our data and so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

393
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">to spend some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time in the app and see</font>

394
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,009
what they're collecting and what they're

395
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:46,070
sending home and back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to headquarters</font>

396
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:48,320
and I think that they may there may be a

397
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,450
discrepancy between what they're saying

398
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,129
and what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing there have been</font>

399
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,230
some hints at that and other research in

400
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:56,840
the past so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be security</font>

401
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,679
research going and finding out something

402
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:04,009
that isn't necessarily public knowledge

403
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,809
yet and then the journalism part would

404
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">be like a journalist coming to me and</font>

405
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:10,279
saying oh this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data that you</font>

406
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,259
found and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to verify it what</font>

407
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,480
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> was when Norton is she didn't</font>

408
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:16,700
verify some data early in her journalist

409
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,490
career and then she published it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

410
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,249
that data was incorrect and designed to

411
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,230
fool noobs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was she never wanted</font>

412
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:26,749
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mistake again so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

413
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,639
she had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify all of the data that</font>

414
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,409
came in if people said oh this is 2

415
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,008
million hat credit card she needed to

416
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:35,600
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure and so you end up doing a lot</font>

417
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,450
of security research if you're going to

418
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,490
be a good security journalist and I

419
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,440
think that those kind of journalists are

420
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,649
rare because we're in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> click beta right</font>

421
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,090
now people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have time for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

422
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:49,479
there are folks like Quinn who take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

423
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,480
seriously

424
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:19,110
yeah sure do you know one I don't have

425
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:22,320
examples offhand I don't have examples

426
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,330
of hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that speaks to the</font>

427
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,049
reasons why people get targeted and

428
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,330
prosecuted right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because um the</font>

429
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:33,570
people who are creating what's perceived

430
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,730
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage are the people who they want</font>

431
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,418
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make samples of and stop you know</font>

432
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:41,789
they're legitimately breaking laws I

433
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:45,750
think Quinn's point was that she<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

434
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:47,519
doesn't know and and it was a risk that

435
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:55,950
she wasn't willing to take because she

436
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:58,080
has a child yes yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

437
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a really important point it's a</font>

438
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,539
chilling effect because the law is

439
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:07,200
ambiguous and confusing and lawyers will

440
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:11,190
say as much I actually saw the American

441
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,100
Bar administration had a post about how

442
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">the language around the Computer Fraud</font>

443
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,789
Act is too ambiguous and so that's the

444
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,980
problem it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ambiguous I personally</font>

445
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,419
can't say this is a path where I'm

446
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,169
breaking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the path where</font>

447
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:30,240
I'm not like I'm safe I'm not safe with

448
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:33,510
traffic laws I know like I know if I'm

449
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,549
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 50 and I know if this is an</font>

450
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:39,980
area where<font color="#E5E5E5"> copter patrolling and the</font>

451
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:42,960
chilling effect is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know I</font>

452
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,340
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's just as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad that I have</font>

453
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,269
public conversations with individuals

454
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,418
that are hated as like any work i

455
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:54,139
actually do and that's part of what i

456
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,139
think is messed up

457
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,669
I think that's right in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

458
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,590
sentences are beyond what's reasonable

459
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:18,409
and just the interpretation of what's

460
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,908
hacking and what's unauthorized I think

461
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:22,429
that's what's worrisome that's what's

462
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:24,769
really worrisome is they'll say changing

463
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:27,620
a URL is hacking because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

464
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,970
advanced to people who you know their

465
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,090
lives aren't on the internet the way

466
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,980
ours are so we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even think of</font>

467
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,320
ourselves as doing a hack we're doing

468
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,950
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not publicly accessible</font>

469
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,769
a URL is publicly accessible right but

470
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,950
you know to certain government officials

471
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:47,120
or justices they'll see changing your

472
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:57,340
URL is like a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sophisticated</font>

473
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:57,340
thing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a hacker thing yeah</font>

474
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:12,600
yeah I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really well stated</font>

475
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,730
and the laws about authorized or

476
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,889
unauthorized access<font color="#CCCCCC"> were written</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

477
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,270
time when just computers and the

478
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so different and they</font>

479
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,260
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been updated appropriately and</font>

480
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the updates that they're looking at our</font>

481
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,800
laquey in the wrong direction and not

482
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:31,230
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarifying things my concern is</font>

483
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,389
you know our government officials either

484
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,910
just technically confused they not

485
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,650
understand it or do they yes understand

486
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,140
it and are going in this direction

487
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:46,020
anyway and either way I find troubling

488
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,490
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because like government</font>

489
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,559
officials like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI to see</font>

490
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,700
technologists as factions and they're

491
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,770
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create a compromised situation</font>

492
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,240
this is specifically with respect to the

493
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,879
debate around encryption we want

494
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,070
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> back doors and the</font>

495
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,340
technologists<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alex stainless from yahoo</font>

496
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,500
like all these really smart CISOs and

497
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,059
and technical advisors are saying

498
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,679
there's no way we can give you back

499
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,690
doors without<font color="#E5E5E5"> also letting China and</font>

500
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Russia in and the government's like we</font>

501
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,790
can compromise we can like surely we can

502
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,679
do it but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of</font>

503
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,730
compromise between like science and

504
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,160
fantasy like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like how do you</font>

505
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,809
write like like this is the science this

506
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the map this is how math works this</font>

507
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:32,879
is how crypto works and I actually

508
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">watched some of the preceding the like</font>

509
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,559
Senate proceedings around this and one

510
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,139
guy was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like don't tell me we could go</font>

511
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the moon the US could go to the moon</font>

512
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,340
and we could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that you really</font>

513
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,980
smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> nerds that you can't like make</font>

514
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,570
this happen and it's like well okay yeah

515
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,300
we can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moon but we can't like</font>

516
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,760
keep anyone else from going there that's

517
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,320
the analogy but like they're just like

518
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,540
you nerds like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

519
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,730
hard enough and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like this is</font>

520
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,870
math we don't know how to change now we

521
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to change the science</font>

522
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:10,720
does anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else have thoughts or any</font>

523
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:16,120
experiences related to this yeah

524
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:18,760
I did I not only submitted it my<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

525
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">up before this we were so broke and we</font>

526
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,070
were so scrappy and we're so desperate

527
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:28,210
and we're so mad about Snowden and the

528
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:32,230
NSA then we built a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little my FOIA</font>

529
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:34,600
request machine and we took $25

530
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:37,360
donations and we automated people<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zeppa</font>

531
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,918
ye requests so i did my request and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

532
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,490
we spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the whole weekend sending</font>

533
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,080
out like hundreds of requests and most

534
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,720
of us got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same letter back which</font>

535
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,980
leaked pretty much said nothing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

536
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because the government</font>

537
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,059
hadn't collected anything on me but

538
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,189
they'll send you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the latter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

539
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:58,690
it's cool it's like has the seal from

540
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:01,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA it depends on how much traffic</font>

541
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:04,750
there getting and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our goal and</font>

542
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,030
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got this idea I got this idea from</font>

543
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jonathan Corvette who's Lily a chi sa</font>

544
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,270
hacker but he was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we're like</font>

545
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,580
we want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to hire like five</font>

546
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,789
more people to handle all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requests</font>

547
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,939
so like they had like they're one person

548
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,710
whose job this is or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's too and</font>

549
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,650
then you start like submitting all these

550
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,620
requests and the timeline gets longer it

551
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:30,340
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about three to four weeks but</font>

552
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,139
who knows right the NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like button</font>

553
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,199
like defunded refunded who knows what's

554
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,789
going on there I don't know anyone who's

555
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,429
following this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the NSA had that</font>

556
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:41,260
sunset and then USA Freedom Act happened

557
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,880
and now like everything's back<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

558
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've got another six months in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

559
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:51,640
clear yeah so I can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep track of</font>

560
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,590
what's actually going on there but it's

561
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,059
cool to send the FYE<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests and see</font>

562
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,678
what the government has on you and

563
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:59,350
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have stuff and i'll send</font>

564
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's redacted but you get a sense of</font>

565
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,549
what they know and what they don't know

566
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:22,900
oh oh man that's a that's a hilarious

567
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:38,620
question yeah why is this person

568
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:40,990
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right right do they</font>

569
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,600
have a person that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know regularly</font>

570
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:47,500
scans or keywords are you just part of

571
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole bulk collection that's so</font>

572
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:53,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard question but interesting</font>

573
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,670
that that's worth looking at

574
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,360
right

575
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:32,860
right it's so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat up it's too</font>

576

much it's too much data how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

577
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,219
managing your security research you seem

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be legal</font>

579
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:24,740
yeah and the laws are changing oh that's

580
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:26,950
a good question do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually know</font>

581
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

582
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,070
Oh

583
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:55,480
the wrong hand Emma or even discuss

584
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:55,480
research said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was using the school</font>

585
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:02,600
there any attention somebody and

586
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:04,960
especially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of us at conferences</font>

587
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,959
you know

588
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:27,418
however that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds really familiar yeah</font>

589
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,879
i mean this top focused on the US but i

590
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:31,769
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start to look the international</font>

591
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:37,428
scene it gets really complicated and for

592
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:37,429
sure things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

593
00:30:50,990 --> 00:31:01,380
right right yeah well and as things

594
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,360
become more inhospitable will all want

595
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go hang out in canada said the</font>

598
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,750
look yeah

599
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:34,520
yeah so we were living in Israel and

600
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,820
ribbon that's his name has dual

601
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,129
citizenship in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US and in Israel he</font>

602
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">has some community service there but</font>

603
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:47,059
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal and I started my</font>

604
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">process of getting that dual citizenship</font>

605
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:51,129
and I stopped because you have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

606
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:55,730
like overhead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and taxes in bureaucracy</font>

607
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:58,370
and I just never finished it but I'd be

608
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,230
welcome to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and Israel is</font>

609
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,689
an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

610
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:06,620
because there's so many like really

611
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:09,200
people working in that now if we hire a

612
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,780
bunch of Israeli cryptographers and

613
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,640
developers and there may be some like

614
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,740
government three-letter agencies who

615
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,080
won't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with us for fear that</font>

616
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,559
maybe we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoored in the Mossad but</font>

617
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,990
that seems fine with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because that's</font>

618
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not the business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brand I just want</font>

619
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,400
to serve either like small to

620
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:32,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">medium-sized you know customers and</font>

621
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:35,809
privacy people for now so I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

622
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:37,460
idea of working with Israeli folks but

623
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:41,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better if we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

624
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:44,600
stay here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be comfortable but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

625
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,460
considering all our options especially

626
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,830
because I'm being advised by people who

627
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:53,419
have companies with headquarters outside

628
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:56,030
the US because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't have a lot of</font>

629
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,350
insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> into what actually happens when</font>

630
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,990
the government comes to you and says we

631
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:03,439
really want to back door<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the company</font>

632
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:05,360
says no because people aren't writing

633
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,280
happy little blog posts about that

634
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,689
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a real hush-hush kind of</font>

635
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,299
conversation you have to be privileged

636
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:14,600
to really get the real real deal on that

637
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:17,929
but I imagine that it's a difficult

638
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,120
position to be in so that's why we're

639
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:22,010
taking these precautions and thinking

640
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,040
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we're</font>

641
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:27,040
kind of willing to do that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

642
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:48,210
no cuz we're not successful and ah so

643
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:49,680
that's right yeah so uh right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that's</font>

644
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,380
all fine because we're so under the

645
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,540
radar and as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> start-up we have so many</font>

646
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,610
problems just being like Oh will we be

647
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,470
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay everyone like in four months</font>

648
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,899
even our tiny little salaries we have

649
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,340
like these really big picture like will

650
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,790
we be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in business and four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

651
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,399
problems that overshadow the more

652
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:13,860
nuanced like what's the logistics of

653
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:16,980
this guy being Irish well yeah and with

654
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:19,860
my last stirred up we had all these

655
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,300
problems like all startups do we hide it

656
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,409
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all started to</font>

657
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,610
have all these problems so my last

658
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,580
company had all these problems and

659
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:30,929
everyone worked in the US and we didn't

660
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,370
have international issues we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

661
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:34,530
any international people right now

662
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,120
because it's I just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know anyone</font>

663
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,280
who's international hoyt want to hire

664
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,710
and as a small company we're under the

665
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">radar so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do weird illegal things</font>

666
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:45,540
cuz all startups do half the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you</font>

667
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,909
don't know and the other half no one

668
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:52,770
cares so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really rely on that like</font>

669
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:55,020
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> through obscurity but yeah I</font>

670
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,759
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should think about that huh what</font>

671
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,290
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in the last startup is I</font>

672
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,570
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I had to do the export</font>

673
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,640
controls for the crypto but I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

674
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,860
website where you start to fill it out

675
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,200
and I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> so scared because I didn't</font>

676
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,490
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how and it was clear like okay I'm</font>

677
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be on some kind of list when I</font>

678
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,770
do this and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to talk to</font>

679
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it so I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to file all my</font>

680
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:19,290
paperwork this time around but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of</font>

681
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">a me is thinking back about my last</font>

682
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:23,550
company is like just too scary to do the

683
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,740
export controls and we're so small no

684
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,700
one cared maybe they look here now and

685
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,109
maybe I'll get a problem I don't know

686
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,259
what the statute of limitations all not

687
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,260
it

688
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:51,460
and put in the back we look out a bit of

689
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:53,080
time yeah yeah you know people don't

690
00:35:51,460 --> 00:36:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">always share that they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been monitored</font>

691
00:35:53,080 --> 00:36:02,110
but um yeah I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is would you</font>

692
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">define Jake Applebaum is like a</font>

693
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:06,580
journalist<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you can actually define</font>

694
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,470
like Julian Assange as a journalist

695
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:12,279
right like he's sharing this stuff with

696
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:15,189
WikiLeaks and they prosecuted the hell

697
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:20,170
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and that was for sharing this</font>

698
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:24,090
stuff now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secrets so</font>

699
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,090
you know you understand the sensitivity

700
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:34,750
yeah thatthat's I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

701
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think Jake Applebaum's probably</font>

702
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,600
the best example of a person who has

703
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:43,980
been monitored any tops about it he<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

704
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:47,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feds show up his mom's house</font>

705
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,270
that was awkward for his mom for him

706
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,129
because they really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what</font>

707
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,020
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do and they wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

708
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:56,200
what Julian Assange was going to do

709
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,940
who's just too close to everything any

710
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,129
of that social graph of like kind of

711
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,340
overtly being an anarchist<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

712
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:08,500
help I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell people I'm not an</font>

713
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:11,650
anarchist so they know has anyone had

714
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:15,210
any experiences with this do you guys

715
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,210
like think you're being monitored

716
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:29,320
hi everyone yeah so glad no one

717
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:31,470
introduced me think we got one in the

718
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,470
back

719
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:48,720
I was too close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the KGB</font>

720
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will do it</font>

721
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:55,499
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of irregularities and a</font>

722
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:59,638
lot of that's come out in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

723
00:38:55,499 --> 00:39:01,979
high-profile cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not surprised it</font>

724
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:04,079
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you reverse this engines</font>

725
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:05,759
they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Silk Road</font>

726
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,519
trial looking at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the misconduct</font>

727
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:11,069
that happened and that was a big issue

728
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,198
in weaves case wave was able to overturn

729
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:14,729
because they were like prosecuting in

730
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,189
the wrong state they're all these you

731
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:19,049
know minor things because he had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

732
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:21,598
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer who is able to suss that</font>

733
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:24,659
out so in some ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that misconduct is</font>

734
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,839
good because we can use it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> overturn</font>

735
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:29,639
these essentially miss trials but it's

736
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,749
obviously not good right I want our

737
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,749
government to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the right thing</font>

738
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:38,140
well what's interesting about enabling

739
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:40,510
illegal activity is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government has</font>

740
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,910
created protections for that for

741
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:46,000
corporations you know you can upload

742
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:49,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">illegal content to YouTube you can send</font>

743
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">dm's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on facebook saying all kinds of</font>

744
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:54,520
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> things illegal things and Facebook</font>

745
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:56,140
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> liable YouTube isn't liable so</font>

746
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,319
we've created<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of protections for</font>

747
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,940
companies and and someone I here at this

748
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:04,839
conference brought that up to me and

749
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:07,480
said look you know yes Silk Road is

750
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,240
facilitating<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegal activity but a lot</font>

751
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,920
of websites do that as a by-product and

752
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've created a lot of corporate shields</font>

753
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,849
for that so I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's just</font>

754
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,980
really interesting and if your<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

755
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:24,789
and you're hosting a legal content as

756
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,680
they've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> for years it's fine if</font>

757
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:29,529
you're facilitating this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of illegal</font>

758
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,419
content it's not fine there's obviously

759
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">a big difference between facilitating</font>

760
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,680
murder and drug sales and facilitating

761
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:38,559
like illegal cat videos and I'm

762
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,069
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that difference but</font>

763
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:45,700
nonetheless it does say something about

764
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:48,069
who gets prosecuted and why someone at

765
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:51,069
this con also mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that the</font>

766
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:53,980
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had done the biggest</font>

767
00:41:51,069 --> 00:41:55,779
donations to political campaigns tended

768
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,849
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the most success and prosecuting</font>

769
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,260
their hackers now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we</font>

770
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,970
can necessarily make the leap<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

771
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's because the government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

772
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,529
partial to them it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be that</font>

773
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:07,690
these companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> had more resources but</font>

774
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:09,069
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying anything about the</font>

775
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:14,490
world we<font color="#E5E5E5"> live in that we don't already</font>

776
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:14,490
know I say hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back</font>

777
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,970
sometimes I parents will let me out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

778
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,970
the house

779
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,578
any other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>

780
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:56,010
you're kind of nodding you have any

781
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,009
insights

782
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:12,720
yeah I think that's it I have to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

783
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">remind myself to be more conscious I do</font>

784
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,709
I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh nothing's gonna happen cuz</font>

785
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,870
I'm you know I'm nice and that had

786
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,850
friends in government but i don't know

787
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:25,920
maybe one day I'll take a talk like this

788
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:32,580
too far on him I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch myself up</font>

789
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:37,980
yeah yeah so I've had a really exciting

790
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:39,990
last two years I dated a special DoD

791
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,250
soldier person who did some kind of

792
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,229
background checking on me and I don't

793
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:48,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">know how much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government resources went</font>

794
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:51,690
into that but yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I don't know</font>

795
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the details there but um just I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

796
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I'm proud of the work I've done in</font>

797
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:01,860
the last two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I like to think</font>

798
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:04,310
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a notice I hope yo so I</font>

799
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">think if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a small file on me then</font>

800
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:09,660
that's probably a sign that I've done

801
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:12,149
some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right in the last few years</font>

802
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:18,560
actually given what I care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

803
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:18,560
hope the files not too big yeah

804
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:31,680
oh sure somewhere where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd be happy</font>

805
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:33,180
right and that's very personal well it

806
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,060
depends on you care about right so I

807
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,980
have a lot of friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think folks</font>

808
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,890
here probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 who've gone off to</font>

809
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,620
Berlin you've got Jake Apple bounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

810
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:46,109
moved there for the privacy laws<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gillian</font>

811
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,810
York from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eff is living there now my</font>

812
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:51,320
friend has the tekes a lot of privacy

813
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:55,710
people are in Berlin so that's really

814
00:44:51,320 --> 00:45:01,170
compelling of all places right my

815
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:03,090
goodness yeah it's personal taste I

816
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,490
would move<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to Israel because I</font>

817
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,620
liked it there I was comfortable there

818
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:10,979
it's obviously a very problematic region

819
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,810
and I fully acknowledge that but it's a

820
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,880
place where I can go and have some

821
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:18,150
familiarity with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture and higher</font>

822
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,880
really great people for my team and the

823
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:24,060
country would welcome me and all things

824
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,810
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some value</font>

825
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:29,250
like co-founders already a citizen there

826
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,600
but I wouldn't recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah</font>

827
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,620
everyone should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just run off to Israel</font>

828
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:38,160
if you have problems here like hell no

829
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:41,549
I'm really interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin that</font>

830
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,080
that's very intriguing but depends what

831
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,110
you want to do I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ecuador can be</font>

832
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,940
really lovely fight over the go<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise</font>

833
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,030
like a hundred thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find</font>

834
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,250
somewhere with a low cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> living and</font>

835
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:55,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">go to your thing silent circle's</font>

836
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,720
headquarters i think is Switzerland so

837
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:01,770
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some you know EU countries</font>

838
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:07,069
they care a lot about privacy and places

839
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:07,070
like Switzerland your kind of nodding

840
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:15,230
you gotta have a sense of humor about

841
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:19,559
this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh I'm a very fierce</font>

842
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:23,880
libertarian I appreciate some government

843
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:26,970
as a very petite woman who likes to you

844
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,309
know occasionally walk the streets alone

845
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,558
at night or you know leave reasonable

846
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:34,499
valuables in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a location like I'm glad</font>

847
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,239
there's a moderate level of police

848
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:39,089
protection I'm glad somebody builds

849
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:41,999
roads you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like I want a minimum</font>

850
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:44,519
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state I think that's great</font>

851
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:46,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think a minimum level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a state is</font>

852
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:49,339
just great it's just the overreach it's

853
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,470
the other each that I worry about you

854
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:55,200
know we could all<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here today having</font>

855
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,538
gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in our cars in having running</font>

856
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,819
water without also having mass

857
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:03,380
surveillance on us mass surveillance is

858
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:06,538
not adding the value from my tax dollars

859
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:10,200
yeah just it's an roi thing I like when
