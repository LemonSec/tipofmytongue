in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other sessions today we're going</font>

17

to talk to you a little bit about the

18
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,520
sausage-making that goes behind the

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,310
coverage of security you're you're

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,199
influenced every day by what you see

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,450
where you get in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> information what</font>

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">you what you know about current events</font>

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,020
and security more importantly there

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,380
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably executives or people</font>

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,959
who have some power over you who read

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,149
stuff too and so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,539
them so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really want to do is</font>

28
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:36,300
leave you with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas on how to deal</font>

29
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that when you know executives come</font>

30

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be news and how the media's influence</font>

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,520
and how how it works and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,890
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm going to bash the media</font>

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,959
quite a bit here because everything we

<font color="#E5E5E5">both coasts and at the end of the day</font>

53
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,170
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really do is PR public relations</font>

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,299
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

55
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,190
security clients right now and we're

56
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking to people like Tim and his</font>

57
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,359
editors every day and we're really

58
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,680
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get our clients in the news we</font>

59
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:47,180
have a lot of thought leaders that we

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,890
represent a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

61
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,340
interesting perspectives that can add

62
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">value and so we position our clients as</font>

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,599
thought leaders and spokespersons to

64
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,310
talk about every breach under the Sun

65
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,010
and there's quite a bit of those as you

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:30,009
between what happened at anthem and what

141
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:32,050
happened at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OPM and there have been</font>

been connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the anthem hack as</font>

145
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,139
well so you know we're you know we're

146
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:46,539
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best as</font>

147
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:49,840
media to give you the information that

148
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:52,840
you need to understand where the hacks

149
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,119
are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what how they're</font>

150
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,119
happening and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

151
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,280
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a lot of cases we don't have as</font>

152
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,280
much information as we should write so

153
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,260
and in a lot of cases we're not telling

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about the the breaches that you need</font>

155
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,270
to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so if you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> target</font>

156
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:12,820
target's sort of the iconic one right we

157
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:17,198
it came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party through an</font>

159
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,970
lot of damage it was it was sort of a a

160
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,820
poster<font color="#CCCCCC"> child for you know in some ways</font>

161
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,430
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what not to do at least from some</font>

162
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,770
people's perspective but there been a

163
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot the larger breaches than that that</font>

164
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,700
you may not have heard about if you look

165
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:41,150
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ebay breach from the same around</font>

166
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,180
time periods last year more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

167
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,210
effective than target nobody talked

168
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,010
about it right we you know if you talk

169
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,349
about home depot or<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the other</font>

170
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,810
big breaches that that you hear about

171
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,270
you might hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them but for some</font>

172
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,770
reason some stories get bigger than

173
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,289
others so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want</font>

174
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do here is talk to you about why does</font>

175
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,960
that happen and you know what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

176
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,120
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know when when all of</font>

177
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:14,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff gets brought up to you by</font>

178
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:17,540
executives so who reports on the

179
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,210
breaches obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like Tim and</font>

180
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,800
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can hear me and there</font>

181
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,919
are a lot of cybersecurity journalists

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,430
out there in fact the landscape has

183
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">grown tenfold I started doing PR and</font>

184
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity in 2003 and at the time</font>

185
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,840
there were just a handful of journalists

186
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're covering cyber and now it's</font>

187
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,550
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much everyone because it impacts</font>

188
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,350
everything and the reporters that we're

189
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,170
talking to you know they are looking for

190
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the big story like Tim said one that's</font>

191
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to draw you know interest and a</font>

192
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,110
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> readers a lot of clicks at the</font>

193
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,430
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day a lot of the publications</font>

194
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,410
that we work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in the reporters</font>

195
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,910
they're evaluated based on click

196
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,310
throughs so it's really important that

197
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,339
the stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they write are going to</font>

198
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,449
get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention and the reporters</font>

199
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,890
are looking for stories that will

200
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,020
interest the average person on the

201
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,819
street or business that everyone has

202
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,650
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> of so again that's going to lead</font>

203
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,480
to more clicks more interest from the

204
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,449
general public and they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

205
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,670
breaking news that has immediacy and

206
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,470
immediate impact and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

207
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:21,380
an interesting thing to bring out now

208
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,300
because right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I feel like day and</font>

209
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,670
day out I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting fires I have a lot</font>

210
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,250
of clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have great stories that</font>

211
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,780
can offer value to the media but when

212
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,300
I'm picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

213
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,339
to reporters there covering the breach

214
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,709
of the day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know three or</font>

215
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,140
four big stories per day that they're

216
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,270
tasked with writing so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> evergreen</font>

217
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,160
topics that I'm pitching although they

218
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,900
might have value and they are important

219
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,150
the reporters don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time they</font>

220
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,680
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just working you know</font>

221
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,520
trying to crank out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next story</font>

222
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,099
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reel</font>

223
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,170
just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of file their story</font>

224
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,210
and be done with the day and it doesn't

225
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">end reporters are doing pieces at</font>

226
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,780
midnight you know I was sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch</font>

227
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,970
of quotes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my clients over last</font>

228
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,800
night to reporters literally at midnight

229
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,620
on OPM because he was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file his</font>

230
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,880
story this morning and and then breaches

231
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,860
are breaking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know big news is</font>

232
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,600
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> on weekends if you think about</font>

233
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,520
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the big apt reports they've</font>

234
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,740
happened either later in the day or on a

235
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,020
Sunday afternoon so the journalists are

236
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,970
working around the clock now<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

237
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber security but at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day</font>

238
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,360
they really do care about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

239
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,520
impact and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> click throughs</font>

240
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,340
they're going to get it's also driven by

241
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,530
advertising you know the more content in

242
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,610
pages that that are served the more

243
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,360
money they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make off of them</font>

244
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,370
so most journalists are looking to at a

245
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,380
specific demographic that will make them

246
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem more unique to an advertiser and</font>

247
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,950
then they're competing with each other

248
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,990
as well these different publications for

249
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,880
advertising dollars a lot of my clients

250
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked me if they should even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be spending</font>

251
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,460
on advertising and you know if your

252
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,170
semantics or a mcafee that has a huge

253
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,240
marketing budget of course you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

254
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,829
but for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the startups that I'm</font>

255
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,200
working with you know they're really

256
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,120
looking for PR to help drive the leads

257
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,400
they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a ton of money</font>

258
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,650
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend on advertising with a lot of</font>

259
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,569
publications so they're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

260
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,310
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of money per month at PR</font>

261
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,460
just to get them quoted and get good

262
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,500
articles and coverage so the key

263
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,310
takeaway<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that the newest most</font>

264
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,870
novel and widespread threats really<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

265
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,430
the highest play and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've all</font>

266
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,050
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see that through the big</font>

267
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,599
headlines that you read every day in the

268
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,490
news but really are these<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

269
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,860
priorities as the professionals<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

270
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:35,690
room is this what you need to know to do

271
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,730
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> job better I think you know the</font>

273
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,950
addition to the various breaches that we

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,900
hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when we talk about</font>

277
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:55,370
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not unusual for dark reading</font>

278
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:58,250
to get a you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new disclosure</font>

now how to disclose a new vulnerability

that they've discovered and that can be

283

you know it's it's very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,790
you have you know the marketing power of

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,350
semantics behind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're willing</font>

286
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to issue a press release and that sort</font>

287
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,560
of thing as opposed to an individual

288
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,290
researcher who's discovered something

289
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,800
maybe even more important but it's very

290
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,769
hard to get the movement that you need

291
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,310
to let people know what you've what you

292
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:31,550
found and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's it you</font>

293
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:34,268
can be affected by who you have behind

294
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:38,240
you you know echoing what you're saying

295
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:40,430
so you have that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this issue and</font>

296
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,649
I always sort of call it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

297
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,819
Kim Kardashian sort of lindsay lohan you

298
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,100
know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of factor you watch your</font>

299
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,649
evening news you know and there's

300
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,720
there's their stuff that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

301
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,990
hear about there's there's just it's

302
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:58,069
just salacious or it's you know sexy

303
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,720
somehow and you and so people sort of

304
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:02,180
vote for it they vote for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it by watching</font>

305
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,009
it or they vote for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by saying yes to</font>

306
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,050
it in surveys or that sort of thing but

307
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,550
is that what you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know is</font>

308
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the kind of stuff that you really</font>

309
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,109
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's it's interesting over</font>

310
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,029
here or it's the kind of stuff that you

311
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,120
actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your for your</font>

312
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:19,550
work and what my argument is would be is

313
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,589
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're getting a lot more Kim</font>

314
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,779
Kardashian<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you are getting the</font>

315
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:26,029
stuff like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the fact that</font>

316
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:27,769
the road you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside your house is</font>

317
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,870
blocked and you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

318
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,209
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work the next day you you know</font>

319
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,480
the sum of the stuff that's out there

320
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:36,979
that that seems very you know exciting

321
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,509
and impactful and that sort of thing it

322
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,269
may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of stuff that you</font>

323
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:44,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to know in order to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle your</font>

324
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,730
particular organization so you know you

325
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,519
look at something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Target you know</font>

326
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,889
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got people being fired you got a</font>

327
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,790
company that everyone knows you got you

328
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:57,939
know consumers who are upset and drawing

329
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,800
lawsuits and you know that sort of thing

330
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:06,560
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of the poster child</font>

331
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:08,449
for you know that for news and yet maybe

332
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,359
not necessarily something that was

333
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:12,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really helpful to you I mean</font>

334
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,459
you you know maybe it got you to think a

335
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,349
little bit about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

336
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,989
connections you know if target was was

337
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,790
accessed through an HVAC vendor maybe it

338
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,130
got you to start thinking about well you

339
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,519
know how what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing to verify you</font>

340
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,019
know the supply chain in our

341
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,570
organization so maybe it was helpful

342
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:33,610
from that perspective but you know in in

343
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,940
some cases it may not have been all that

344
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:39,940
useful to you you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an item for</font>

345
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,740
you to work on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> day yet you may have</font>

346
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,440
some executive somewhere saying what are

347
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,690
we doing about this we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

348
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:51,430
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the kind of disconnect that</font>

349
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,320
you begin to run into you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

350
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,199
some companies are really good at PR I

351
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I'd mentioned ebay as an example of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">slid by nobody talked about it and</font>

354
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,200
partly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have good PR yeah I</font>

355
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,019
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that candidly it plays</font>

356
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,190
a big part<font color="#CCCCCC"> in how big some news gets and</font>

357
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,570
that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that you know I've</font>

358
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the front lines working with</font>

359
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,579
large companies that have had most

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,220
recently big threat Intel reports that

361
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:20,620
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to get out and make a</font>

you know the users of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was kind of funny around</font>

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the holiday time I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

trade journalist and when the Sony

breach happened all of these reporters

386
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,819
got inundated with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latest</font>

you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony attacks happened</font>

technology at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

393
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,850
reporters see through all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that they</font>

394
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:29,740
see it and they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was</font>

395
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,620
nothing anyone could have done to

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,630
prevent it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> journalist</font>

397
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,079
said that he ended up getting a pitch

398
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,339
from someone that said quite candidly

399
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,410
they couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevented it it was</font>

400
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,360
an awful breach and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

401
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,490
really nice for somebody to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest</font>

402
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,500
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for once to say you know what</font>

403
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,139
it's a horrible thing we couldn't have

404
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,639
fixed it we couldn't have prevented it

405
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,800
the reporters do see through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

406
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fud that the PR pros and the</font>

407
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,389
vendors are spinning up to them so it's

408
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,490
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys to know</font>

409
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:03,880
because again it feeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this larger</font>

410
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,859
discussion you know don't exactly I

411
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,669
guess except everything you read that's

412
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:12,458
out there because a lot of it has spin

413
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:17,169
and so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

414
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:18,909
what the sausage that gets made behind

415
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the scenes where you know where the news</font>

416
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:26,199
comes from and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> then how the media</font>

417
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:29,530
works you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know bottom line reporters are</font>

418
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,929
people right so and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a job to</font>

419
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,149
do every day I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to file two stories</font>

420
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,610
or my<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have to file you know two</font>

421
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,190
or three stories so they're in a lot of

422
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases they're taking whatever the</font>

423
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,460
low-hanging fruit is they're being

424
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,630
pumped full of information they they're

425
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,820
seeing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same stuff that</font>

426
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,940
you're seeing on Twitter there they're

427
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting information from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

428
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,059
vendors that are in the space there and

429
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,070
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting information from</font>

430
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:59,620
researchers if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky we have a</font>

431
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good network of researchers so we</font>

432
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,059
have some sense for what new

433
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:07,260
vulnerabilities are being reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

434
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:09,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">to day you know you're you're on a</font>

435
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,120
constant deadline you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have time</font>

436
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go into the depth that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

437
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,789
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know bottom line we end up</font>

438
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,980
writing a lot of stories where we don't

439
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lot of information OPM is a great</font>

440
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:27,010
example so yesterday opium came out and

441
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,010
said you know well we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a breach</font>

442
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happened back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in April we think</font>

443
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,030
maybe it was the Chinese

444
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,070
we don't know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it came from you</font>

445
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,990
know Chinese IP addresses which we all

446
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,659
know means nothing so they're basically

447
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,330
telling us very little bit spirit that's

448
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,580
useful so we're reporting everything

449
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,669
that we know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you're going to</font>

450
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,679
find a thousand people who have an idea

451
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,870
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we think it was</font>

452
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,700
this is how we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happened you</font>

453
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,909
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing but very little</font>

454
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,430
that's that's really reliable so it's

455
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:04,480
ironic but a lot of the news that you

456
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,530
see about breaches or things that are

457
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,870
happening in security even

458
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:13,420
vulnerabilities is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

459
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,719
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it's not baked you don't know</font>

460
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,460
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the breach came from the</font>

461
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,780
vulnerability this being reported may

462
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,410
not have been checked out by other

463
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:26,830
experts yet it's it's very early stuff

464
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,560
but we're reporting what we have and so

465
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,899
take it with a grain of salt there's you

466
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,090
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you know you can you can look</font>

467
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,360
at it say okay well you know I know

468
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,459
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a big breach at OPM you know</font>

469
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,139
that's it's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people worried</font>

470
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,410
there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people whose data is</font>

471
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,360
is out there you know possibly but

472
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,150
that's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> as much as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can say and</font>

473
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,040
and and I'm at a point now where I've

474
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,540
got some of my reporters going back and

475
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,780
writing stories about breaches that

476
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:59,200
happen say a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year ago because that's</font>

477
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,540
more useful to what you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> do then the</font>

478
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,190
latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach because at this point if</font>

479
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,080
you get say state of South Carolina that

480
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,990
was two years ago two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half years</font>

481
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,970
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they released the full mandiant</font>

482
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,610
report that talked about exactly what

483
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,130
happened you can you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out</font>

484
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,919
exactly how the breach occurred you can

485
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,930
go into some depth and really learn

486
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,460
something from it which is the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

487
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,990
you know if we're going to write breach

488
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,870
stories we want you guys to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

489
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,370
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> from it and so that's that's</font>

490
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,280
sort of where we're shifting our our

491
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,110
thinking is that maybe you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

492
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,570
more about what we really know about

493
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:40,000
versus just what have

494
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,210
to be the breaking story yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

495
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,400
add to that point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know after OPM</font>

496
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,960
broke last night in the next you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

497
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple weeks months there's going to be</font>

498
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,280
more information that's going to roll

499
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,500
out and the role of the PR firm or the

500
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,629
marketing person that's you know trying

501
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get a client or a vendor in the news</font>

502
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,040
is to really piece together sort of that

503
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,110
puzzle so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it turns out that</font>

504
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,780
this was because of a spear phishing

505
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,399
attack well if we're working with you

506
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,840
know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> spear phishing anti spearfishing</font>

507
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,360
company they have the perfect

508
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,980
opportunity to comment and it makes

509
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,929
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them to comment so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

510
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,880
lot of times where you know breaches do

511
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,860
happen and you know all my clients want

512
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,660
to comment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to temper them</font>

513
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,979
down a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit because it may not</font>

514
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,380
make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

515
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,840
information for them to be a reliable

516
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,460
person to comment on the news and so

517
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,649
that's where you know I counsel my

518
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,330
clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's wait and see maybe</font>

519
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,400
there will be some connections made in

520
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,050
the next few days where<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it makes</font>

521
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,050
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to say hey my technology</font>

522
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,550
might have helped with that so I think

523
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's that's another perspective</font>

524
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,000
of it all is that you know connecting

525
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dots and that does happen in you</font>

526
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,110
know day two day three you know day

527
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,060
eight stories that's why reporters have

528
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,179
to keep covering certain breaches over

529
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:56,590
and over again as that news trickles out

530
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:59,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact of</font>

531
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:04,270
a breach it often<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes a lot if you</font>

532
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:06,190
look at you know anthem for example we

533
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,810
had started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that they said well well</font>

534
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,310
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a million then it was four</font>

535
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,190
million then it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven point eight</font>

536
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:15,639
million you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

537
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:19,620
a lot and you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you don't know</font>

538
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,180
right away all the details until until

539
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:26,260
they have either been shared by a

540
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,390
reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> source or there has been a you</font>

541
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,740
know something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mandiant report or</font>

542
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,860
something that you can point to and says

543
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:36,580
this is how the breach occurred so you

544
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,740
know the point there you know take the

545
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking news that you see and</font>

546
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,540
follow up with it make sure you

547
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand what the what the real impact</font>

548
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,080
was how it really happened because

549
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,100
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times you'll see particularly</font>

550
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,230
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CNN s and the NPR's and the</font>

551
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,840
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are responsible for reporting</font>

552
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:59,590
stuff on the hour a lot of the early

553
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,300
reports will be not very reliable and so

554
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,790
there's there's a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort</font>

555
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">of comes out that's taken that's widely</font>

556
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:09,250
thought to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> true and yet when you</font>

557
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,720
actually look back on it a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

558
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:16,390
it wasn't so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's talk a</font>

559
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,090
little bit about who influences the news

560
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,750
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give us our</font>

561
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,189
information yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I see one of</font>

562
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,560
them in the room here his name is Chris

563
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,200
Ames sitting back there so you know

564
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,030
Chris gets quoted a lot in in you know

565
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of different publications you know</font>

566
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,870
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's business press or trade or</font>

567
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,610
broadcast because he's a reliable source

people that get quoted over and over

582

again and the in news stories and it's

583
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:10,120
just because they're accessible and they

play into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter of course plays a</font>

588
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,980
big role in news as you guys know it's

589
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,970
faster than any news outlet I<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

590
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,070
look at Twitter first thing in the

591
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,230
morning do a quick scan so I can figure

592
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,550
out you know for my team what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

596
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,350
buzz<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does start I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot on</font>

597
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,280
Twitter and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really helpful</font>

598
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:44,919
to for PR pros like myself to sort of

599
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,290
validate you know whether a story is

600
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,290
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be big enough to to even pay</font>

601
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:53,050
attention to so there's a lot of you

602
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,860
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security influencers that will</font>

00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,500
comment

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">fourth on Twitter and on social networks</font>

605
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">I see them on facebook to and LinkedIn</font>

606
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:04,090
but you can see the smart people really

607
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:06,640
sort of commenting on some of the news

608
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,659
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know again if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shut it</font>

609
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,910
down if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't think it's all that</font>

610
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,590
important then I trust what they say

611
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:14,320
because you know I know them to be very

612
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">smart individuals and then there's</font>

613
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,399
individual people on Twitter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry</font>

614
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,380
a lot of weight people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristoff</font>

615
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,260
people love him<font color="#E5E5E5"> he gets quoted quite a</font>

616
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,940
bit and a lot of stories and people talk

617
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,429
about him and it's just because he's

618
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,500
he's a big influencer there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

619
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:31,840
ones in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room too so so yeah Twitter</font>

620
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,809
or social networks plays into news and

621
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,480
then other media so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned earlier</font>

622
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,668
that I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with the new york</font>

623
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">times on an exclusive about a year ago</font>

624
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:44,559
and exclusives are great if you really

625
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,770
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that big bang for your buck</font>

626
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,678
story you get it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those highly</font>

627
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:53,620
read business<font color="#E5E5E5"> publications but you also</font>

628
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,600
run the risk of irritating and making

629
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,120
other journalists mad and having them

630
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,330
play catch-up so the day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we broke</font>

631
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,100
the news of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York Times as soon</font>

632
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,678
as the news broke as soon as her story

633
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,149
came out my whole team had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work in</font>

634
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,830
overdrive to call the rest of the

635
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,090
reporters and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell him about the news so</font>

636
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,149
that they could cover it within that

637
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:16,059
window to them it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's</font>

638
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:18,610
that hour to two hours to three hours to

639
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:20,830
get a news story out and you know the

640
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,449
influence of a wall street<font color="#E5E5E5"> journal or</font>

641
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,040
you know USA Today or New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> Times</font>

642
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,600
breaking something they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font>

643
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play catch-up that's just their job</font>

644
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,540
and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to report it</font>

645
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,899
even if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to was funny</font>

646
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,780
that day is Reuters journalists over

647
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:38,080
there talk to me and no pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much had</font>

648
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of inappropriate cuss words</font>

649
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,309
because he was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> irritated that he</font>

650
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't get the story first and so that</font>

651
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:46,090
again that's just how it works sometimes

652
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,559
it's unfortunate but it's sort of the

653
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,889
game that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets played behind the scenes</font>

654
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:52,899
on the PR side and then of course search

655
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,580
engines and you know that influences the

656
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,700
news you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> google rankings on Google</font>

657
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,590
News

658
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's definitely important and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

659
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,580
the publications have to optimize their

660
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,678
stories so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you look at a</font>

661
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,629
headline it's basically what's going to

662
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,919
pull up first in those searches when

663
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,559
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google News and things</font>

664
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,880
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really important so</font>

665
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,678
the key takeaway<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

666
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,899
reporters<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're influenced by the same</font>

667
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,309
stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are what's on Twitter what</font>

668
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,979
you're reading about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's on the web</font>

669
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:21,769
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are talking about if you</font>

670
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do to</font>

671
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:29,090
kind of moderate what you're getting

672
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:33,169
from a lot of the news<font color="#CCCCCC"> media is have a</font>

673
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:36,230
really good set of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:38,690
follow on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter you know if you Dan</font>

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">chris weitz opals and the you know</font>

677
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,700
Jeremiah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grossman's that they're there a</font>

678
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,320
set of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart and</font>

679
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,019
they're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good about tweeting and</font>

680
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,210
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they see in the</font>

681
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:55,730
media that doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense or that</font>

682
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,309
they have a lot of questions about and

683
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,380
it's a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to sort of temper what</font>

684
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,840
you're what you're seeing in the media

685
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,909
and have some weapons to go into a

686
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,689
meeting with and say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe this</font>

687
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:11,779
isn't as big a deal as we hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

688
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,269
other thing that that we can't emphasize

689
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:17,210
enough here is that you know most people

690
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:21,049
don't go to publications<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way they</font>

691
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,480
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know you have you know it</font>

692
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,279
used to be that for example dark reading

693
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,070
people would pull up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know in</font>

694
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,630
the morning and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be their main</font>

695
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,029
source of information we hope it still

696
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:33,409
is but you know realistically it's a lot

697
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:35,600
of googling right you know you're

698
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:37,399
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for information you know that</font>

699
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,719
something happened at OPM you're going

700
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:43,158
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google OPM you're going to get a</font>

701
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,470
whole list of stories and so as a result

702
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,899
of that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of media there's a lot of</font>

703
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,049
media jockeying to get to the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

704
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:53,719
that google search and there's there a

705
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:55,730
lot of folks who buy their way into that

706
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,350
so what you see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of your</font>

707
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,929
google search isn't necessarily who's

708
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:04,370
being most read who shelled out the most

709
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:06,200
money and so you know just take

710
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,559
everything with a grain of salt when

711
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,529
you're doing your research

712
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,928
for sources that you know are reliable

713
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:14,610
sources that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know don't go to you</font>

714
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:17,039
know sort of the knee-jerk you know

715
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:20,668
stories and and and that sort of thing

716
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,039
so so you have when you go into a

717
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:25,139
conversation with somebody about you

718
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,509
know what the impact of a news event

719
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:30,990
might be on your organization you have

720
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:36,299
some some smart people who are weighing

721
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:38,610
into to your your viewpoint let's talk a

722
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,619
little bit about why stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> get big why</font>

723
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,629
are why is it that we end up hearing

724
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:46,168
over and over about some stories and

725
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:47,039
others don't yeah I mean some of these

726
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,710
things we've already touched on

727
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,019
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big numbers you know when</font>

728
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,580
you see a you know a breach or a

729
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,830
vulnerability that's going to impact

730
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,049
millions of people of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

731
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,759
to be big<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess about a year and a</font>

732
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:02,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">half ago I worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the security</font>

733
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,610
consultancy on a tinder vulnerability

734
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,279
that they had found<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tinder of course</font>

735
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:10,830
is you know the dating app whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

736
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,049
want to call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we knew we were</font>

737
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,970
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that team that this was</font>

738
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:18,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get big play that we were going</font>

739
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:20,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to to go to more consumer II</font>

740
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:22,950
and broadcast<font color="#E5E5E5"> journalists to cover</font>

741
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:24,269
dinner because again it's everybody

742
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,850
knows that maybe they use it maybe they

743
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't but it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

744
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,789
impact and everybody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so and</font>

745
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,200
then big names of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

746
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,720
hear about breaches out the more

747
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,119
well-known companies you know federal

748
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,879
agencies as well because again we all

749
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,100
know these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you know I</font>

750
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:46,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the retail and healthcare markets</font>

751
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,449
of course have had the biggest sort of

752
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,590
breaches in the past it's a year year

753
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,539
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half and it all kind of started</font>

754
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,399
with target and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> marquez</font>

755
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:56,070
it was home depot so you know those

756
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:57,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known you know companies they're</font>

757
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:01,529
definitely going to make more readers

758
00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:03,418
and bigger headlines and then big claims

759
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,249
you know when you say that it's the

760
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,690
first biggest or most dangerous

761
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:09,240
vulnerability that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever found the</font>

762
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest breach you know which we saw</font>

763
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,630
with heartbleed and some of the

764
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">follow-up</font>

765
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,590
cell type vulnerabilities in the past

766
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:18,420
year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your those are definitely going</font>

767
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,860
to be stories that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

768
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,550
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of play and they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be all</font>

769
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:27,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">over every type of you know publication</font>

770
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:29,669
and then unusual threat actors so I

771
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of interest right</font>

772
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,480
now and what's happening with

773
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,970
nation-state attacks and cyber espionage

774
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,680
and I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can blame our friends</font>

775
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,140
over at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mandy it because it all kicked</font>

776
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,970
off with a PT 1 and you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

777
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,890
the threat Intel providers push out

778
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,700
similar types of reports over the past

779
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:50,790
two years you know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course sony put it</font>

780
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think even more on the radar that yeah</font>

781
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is under attack and so</font>

782
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:56,760
consumers now are aware of these things

783
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,160
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they probably didn't Karen</font>

784
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,890
they didn't know but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

785
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,710
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changed the landscape and then a</font>

786
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,730
politically motivated attack so

787
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,740
anonymous of course a few years ago

788
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,030
there were a lot of stories about what

789
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,410
they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of cyber</font>

790
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,940
activism against companies organizations

791
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:17,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">HP Gary of course felt the brunt of that</font>

792
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,910
unfortunately and then highly

793
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,980
sophisticated attackers so Stuxnet you

794
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,170
know obviously that one gets referenced

795
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,600
probably the most when we talk about

796
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,990
attacks on critical infrastructure so

797
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,250
those definitely do get big play and the

798
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,360
reporters have to build on these stories

799
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are just going to get a lot of</font>

800
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,929
readers just it's their job so they've

801
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,290
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on these big play type</font>

802
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:44,280
stories but the the irony of all about

803
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:46,740
us that is that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you become more and</font>

804
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:50,820
more focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know man bites dog</font>

805
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,710
vs dog bites man the whole industry can

806
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,639
tend to shift and I think we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

807
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,960
right now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to we were in a</font>

808
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,570
situation where we were talking about

809
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly about malware and viruses and the</font>

00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:05,100
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day stuff and then</font>

811
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the development of fire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I and and</font>

812
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,879
some of the discussions around

813
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,710
sophisticated threats and sucks net and

814
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,840
that sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've become more and</font>

815
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,260
more focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on targeted attacks we've</font>

816
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,030
become more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more focused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

817
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:21,000

818
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,399
sophisticated the the advanced

819
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,090
persistent threat

820
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,500
that sort of thing and not that we don't

821
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to pay attention to those things</font>

822
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you have to remember that those are</font>

823
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,090
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten percent the five percent</font>

824
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:38,090
that those are the least frequent types

825
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,399
of attacks and maybe not mapping very

826
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,590
well to what you deal with every day you

827
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to deal with the kind of malware</font>

828
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,780
the automated malware polymorphic stuff

829
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:51,140
that is just it's just constantly coming

830
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,910
at you and yet we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing about</font>

you're not getting a lot of help in

833
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,270
terms of what to do about it or what

834

<font color="#CCCCCC">what's which technology should be using</font>

835
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,800
because we're all getting focused on the

836
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:07,730
more interesting stuff it's it's that

837
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:10,790
sexy stuff the the shiny stuff that that

838
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,969
tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the most coverage and so</font>

839
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:16,699
you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you begin to balance your</font>

does that happen we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:44,870
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's it sort of starts with you</font>

851
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:48,320
know a tweet and then it gets sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

852
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:50,149
you know megaphone to cross the across

853
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,640
the internet and the next thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

854
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:54,649
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topic among all of us security</font>

855
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,069
people as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the water</font>

856
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:59,930
coolers and that sort of thing yeah I

857
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean we've already touched on this a lot</font>

858
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,250
but yeah it does start on Twitter and

859
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media vets the story ideas through</font>

860
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,310
those key influencers to people they

861
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,140
know the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their rolodexes that</font>

862
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,670
they can just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know make sure that</font>

863
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,650
what they're writing is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

864
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,650
impactful I've had situations where

865
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,940
journalists have actually called me and

866
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,710
said hey what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

867
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,170
story is it you know big enough to write

868
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:22,940
about or in other cases they've actually

869
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,580
called me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said yeah I saw so-and-so</font>

870
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,930
wrote on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> story and she didn't</font>

871
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,670
report it correctly there were a lot of

872
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,779
inaccuracies in her story so you know

873
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,420
what I'm not going to cover it because

874
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,040
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

875
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,720
lumped in with her and you know the

876
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">other crowd of journalists that don't</font>

877
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,848
have their<font color="#E5E5E5"> facts straight so it's really</font>

878
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting how that happens um so yeah</font>

879
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,380
influencers might be influenced and then

880
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,880
search engines we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

881
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the media spends a lot of time</font>

882
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,980
working on SEO so do our clients you

883
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the marketing departments are</font>

884
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,619
always looking at search engine

885
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,750
optimization every time I write a press

886
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,950
release we have to SEO it because again

887
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,740
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that it gets high</font>

888
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,839
in the rankings on Google search and

889
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,118
then crowdsourcing so there's sort of

890
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:05,279
this slashdot effect if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get / dotted</font>

891
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,099
you know and you're quoted in the news

892
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,660
you're kind of a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

893
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,160
that that definitely plays a role of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

894
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,618
and then competing for eyeballs so

895
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,930
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> is looking for traffic you</font>

896
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:17,790
know the journalists they really do need

897
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stories they write</font>

898
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,640
are going to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of clicks and</font>

899
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,189
then some stories do you get

900
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,500
sensationalized that's unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

901
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,480
that's again our<font color="#E5E5E5"> message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you is be</font>

902
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,460
careful what you read because some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

903
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,400
is overhyped which is probably a good

904
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:41,369
term and then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> again others are</font>

905
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:43,950
optimized for search engines so one of

906
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:49,859
the things that that happens is that we

907
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:52,500
find that you know some stories there's

908
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:55,319
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information so the OPM is a good</font>

909
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,290
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we wrote a story last night</font>

910
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:59,940
about OPM this morning we found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

911
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,308
there may or may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a connection</font>

912
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,630
between the anthem hackers in the OPM

913
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:07,109
hackers so you'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> see another</font>

914
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,819
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> today or Monday you know target</font>

915
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:10,529
was another great<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of where we</font>

916
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:13,470
wrote one story then we wrote another

917
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:17,180
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you know anthem is the</font>

918
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:20,730
same sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you're you're</font>

919
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,319
reporting new facts as you as you get

920
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:25,770
them in but what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it creates</font>

921
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:28,589
sort of an overabundance a skewing of

922
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:31,609
the news so that you hear more about

923
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:35,308
certain things than you do about others

924
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:37,650
you know generally reporters find

925
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:41,670
themselves at you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the mercy of</font>

926
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:44,819
the what other publications are covered

927
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:47,670
so you know if the New York Times writes

928
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:49,799
something you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll generally feel</font>

929
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,440
like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> well will you at least need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

930
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:54,450
address it so that you know we give our

931
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,599
our angle we give the actual technical

932
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,399
angle on the story and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of</font>

933
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,470
thing so you get the this sort of

934
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,559
megaphone that sort of resonates across

935
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:09,328
the web from certain types of stories

936
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:12,660
and reporters are reaching for stories

937
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:16,829
that they know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have where they</font>

938
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:19,259
have sources that are people that they

939
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:20,819
trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're so they're they're sort of</font>

940
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,470
reaching for the same sources over and

941
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:25,079
over again so you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

942
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,919
hearing the same sources of stories over

943
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,359
and over again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

944
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,980
stories that are home runs stories that

945
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get those hundred thousand</font>

946
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,940
page views or you know million page

947
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:42,598
views or you know however many so and

948
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:46,339
yet again smaller breaches breaches that

949
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,990
may be of software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

950
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:51,690
technologies that you're using may not

951
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:54,328
get covered you can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

952
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:56,910
data breaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> com you'll see a lot of</font>

953
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:59,430
breaches that never get covered and yet

954
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:03,149
may be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to you in terms of</font>

955
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:06,210
understanding what what the universe is

956
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:10,079
or what's happening in other companies

957
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are like yours so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can you</font>

958
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,760
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw some conclusions home</font>

959
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:23,069
so security pros we have we've talked

960
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,099
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways that</font>

961
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:31,049
we get our information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes from a</font>

962
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:33,480
variety of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different sources but how you</font>

963
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:36,359
prioritize your<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to those things</font>

964
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">is completely different right so you</font>

965
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,940
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sources that you're</font>

967
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,839
you know what are we doing about x<font color="#E5E5E5"> y&z</font>

968
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:49,259
you know we've read about it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall</font>

compliance mandates that are responsive

975
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:06,330
so you have indicators that maybe that

976
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:08,010
something has changed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:17,010
industry reports notifications you get

it you need to recognize you know kind

1003
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,940
of that the media isn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

1004
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:29,550
folks who are most intimately familiar

with what you what you're doing yeah I

1007
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,420
these good points already the media

1008
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,340
doesn't know your environment you know

1009

<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what you're dealing with</font>

1010
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,020
in your security operations center or

1011
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,819
what threats are coming at you so these

1012
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,009
hot threats and these over publicized

1013
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,420
breaches may not even impact your

1014
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:51,030
organization of what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do on a</font>

1015
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,280
day-to-day basis and then your top

00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,720
executives don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the media so they</font>

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,760
don't know how it works behind the

hot in the media might not be what's

1031
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:30,110
important to you and organization and

1032
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:33,350
what you do on a day-to-day basis so you

1033
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:37,280
know a few takeaways you know we talked

1034
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:39,830
a little bit about having a set of

1035
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,780
filters that that are specific to your

1036
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:45,950
organization and your particular needs

1037
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:48,500
you know that they may be Twitter folks

1038
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:51,490
that you think are particularly smart or

1039
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,380
know your industry really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it may be</font>

1040
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:56,509
certain publications that you that you

1041
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:02,510
find that are more reliable than others

1042
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:04,730
it may be just a general filter that

1043
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,280
says I only want data about these

1044
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,570
systems because this is what I have sort

1045
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,480
of the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing it</font>

1046
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,220
with threat intelligence now right you

1047
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,530
have to take your getting feeds of all

1048
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:18,290
kinds of stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to figure</font>

1049
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,910
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's relevant to you and you know</font>

1050
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,410
quite honestly when the executives say

1051
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,060
well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw this in the New York</font>

1052
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:27,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">Times you need to be able to say you</font>

1053
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:29,630
know sorry it's not important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us and</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know treat it more like if you look</font>

at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the financial financial analyst</font>

1056
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,890
that's the way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> treat the news right</font>

1057
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,230
you know some if they have a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

1058
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:42,049
of investments that they're protecting

1059
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,150
then they follow certain companies very

1060
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,010
closely companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you wouldn't even</font>

1061
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,830
you know consider to be important

1062
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:51,650
normally in the general trade press but

1063
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,060
for them that's their their lifeblood

1064
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,530
and you're and you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1065
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,410
the same thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating your own</font>

1068
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:08,600
on who you are so yeah just to kind of

try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap up I know we have a few</font>

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,820

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> either they have been breached</font>

1075
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,840
or they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be or they just don't know</font>

1076
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,910
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's that phrase that we</font>

1077
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,220
hear and read everywhere so at some

1078
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,960
point it probably will happen you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1079
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,359
it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about you know</font>

1080
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,100
what will be the fallout<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a crisis</font>

1081
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:36,180
communications perspective on your

1082
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:38,700
organization and you know again we've

1083
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">worked with a lot of clients on crisis</font>

1084
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:44,189
comms and you know to sort of have a

1085
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:46,950
plan in place for when or if this ever

1086
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,450
does happen unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> in security</font>

1087
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,430
there's a lot of vendors that have been

1088
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,740
breached RSA is probably the poster

1089
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,480
child for it a few years back it's

1090
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,009
unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1093
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,010

00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,180
something hits the news they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to quick you need to be able to disclose</font>

1097
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,220
what you have to to the authorities<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1098
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,950
put even less to the media in that

1099
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,618
moment when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you see your</font>

1100
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:19,259
company in the headlines there's there's

1101
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:21,030
that fear factor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know okay is</font>

1102
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,359
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> job going to be at risk because we</font>

got<font color="#E5E5E5"> breached or something bad happened</font>

1104
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you have to maintain accuracy you</font>

1105
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,150
have to be honest you have to have

1106
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrity and you have to really</font>

1107
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,810
communicate a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago I believe it</font>

1108
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,940
was bit9 who got breached there was um

1109
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:41,310
you know I know actually the woman who

1110
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,800
did the PR for them at the time they did

1111
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of communicating through their</font>

1112
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,750
blog to you know their customers their

1113
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,250
partners and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually was good in</font>

1114
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:53,010
that sense you know they disclosed what

1115
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,720
they needed as they knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and that was</font>

1116
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know that opened transparency I</font>

1117
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,850
think made people feel a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

1118
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:01,290
more comfort and that bit9 was taking it

1119
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,029
seriously that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were taking the</font>

1120
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,640
right steps you know that they were

1121
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,050
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right things so um and then</font>

1122
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,600
whenever possible you know if it does

1123
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:12,780
happen to your organization turn the

1124
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,089
breach into a positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> spin so you know</font>

1125
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,290
heartland<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think their CEO is probably</font>

1126
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,750
the best example that I could remember

1127
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:21,450
when they got breached he actually went

1128
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,180
out and did a lot of public talks and he

1129
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,009
said here's what we did wrong and here

1130
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,250
what you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from our mistakes and</font>

1131
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:30,619
I think that that that helped you know

1132
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,210
the public feel like re you know he's

1133
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">being honest with us he's telling us</font>

1134
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,450
okay we were wrong we did these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1135
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:37,220
wrong he's trying to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1136
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,308
companies not make those same mistakes

1137
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:42,740
and then you need to recognize all

1138
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:43,970
aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential impact so think</font>

1139
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,950
about what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen with your</font>

1140
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:48,078
investors think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the brand damage</font>

1141
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,899
that might happen the loss of trust

1142
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,849
amongst customers and suppliers and then

1143
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,800
the loss of credibility so you have to

1144
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:56,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">really think really broadly you know</font>

1145
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,859
this ever does happen to you or your

1146
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,099
organization about all of the fallout

1147
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:03,140
and have that crisis<font color="#CCCCCC"> coms plan in place</font>

1148
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:04,880
and be ready you know at any point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1149
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:14,210
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that every</font>

1150
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:17,480
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have so yeah so yeah I</font>

1151
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a sense for</font>

1152
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,290
you know where you know what where some

1153
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,390
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories come from and how they</font>

1154
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:26,589
work is are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions that we</font>

1155
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:26,589
can answer just one in the back

1156
00:47:43,589 --> 00:48:06,749
I I think we do and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly a</font>

1157
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:09,719
dark reading we the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem is that</font>

1158
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:13,529
that there's so much of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost every</font>

1159
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:15,239
vendor that has a research knishes an

1160
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:18,299
annual report or some cases its

1161
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,729
quarterly even monthly and so we're

1162
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:23,099
inundated as you know as reporters were

1163
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:26,038
inundated with that kind of data and so

1164
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:28,739
we do try to report on it the reason

1165
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:31,229
that we focused so much on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ir is</font>

1166
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:33,509
because it's an actual threat data is it

1167
00:48:31,229 --> 00:48:36,269
sort of actual breach data that's in

1168
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:38,279
those are real incidents a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1169
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:40,049
stuff that you see out there is surveys

1170
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:42,869
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some were you breached last</font>

1171
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:45,839
month no no we weren't you know and so

1172
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:47,789
you for us we try to filter it a little

1173
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,460
bit so that the data that you get when

1174
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:53,210
we write<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a report is it's</font>

1175
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use oh</font>

1176
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:59,759
yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that that's that's one of</font>

1177
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,469
our big stories every year my PR for a

1178
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:04,710
merit group actually launched the DVR

1179
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:06,809
and did the pr fort for five years so it

1180
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,279
is probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most cited one of the</font>

1181
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:10,049
most credible reports that's out there

1182
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,519
so continue to use that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1183
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:18,059
it does offer a lot of valuable

1184
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:19,529
information any other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font>

1185
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for coming thanks</font>

1186
