security research firm that brings

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,940
together some definitely not all but

75
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,280
some of the brightest<font color="#E5E5E5"> minds in the</font>

industry to tackle the world's toughest

77
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,919
security challenges so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a cartoon</font>

78
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,530
aspired by the hacker strip guys

79
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,079
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them i am a chain-smoking</font>

hackers who are poised to save the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

83
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,359
one hack at a time I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've</font>

84
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,639
actually met me because they don't smoke

85
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,709
I prefer flip-flops to businesses and

86
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,359
it's my legions of hackers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

87
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely inspiring me on how we're</font>

88
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:50,530
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go save the world so I wasn't</font>

89
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,930
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security I kind of tripped and</font>

90
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,290
fell into the industry a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago I</font>

91
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,299
grew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a hardcore sports fan going to</font>

92
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yankee games with my dad and playing</font>

93
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,739
soccer and lacrosse with my friends and

94
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,270
so after studying psychology in school

95
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,150
not too far<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

96
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,610
I got my start<font color="#CCCCCC"> in sports marketing it</font>

97
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,590
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun I loved all the team</font>

98
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,050
dynamics and dissecting what made the

99
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,620
fans tick and how to get him out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

100
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,870
games and so my first entry point into

101
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,970
security was actually a campaign that we

102
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,740
launched with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the New York Yankees to</font>

103
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,690
convince fans it was actually safe to

104
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,990
bring their kids to Yankee Stadium it

105
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,910
was like a little girls dream come true

106
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,350
but I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> young and I was curious I want</font>

107
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,060
to see what else was out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

108
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,970
was definitely inspired by this big

109
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,770
shiny tech bubble that was luring me in

110
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,570
and start ups were popping up all around

111
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,169
me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be part of the</font>

112
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,150
intensity so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> dive in headfirst and my</font>

113
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,160
head was literally spinning in the early

114
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,080
days I was like the lone marketing

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,820
person surrounded by developers and

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,430
researchers who all spoke a completely

117
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,680
different language than me but I was

118
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,050
hooked I was lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough in the early</font>

119
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,640
days to be taken under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wings of</font>

120
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,980
folks like Marty rash Marcus random and

121
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,270
their legions of researchers some of

122
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,670
whom are actually in the audience today

123
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,690
so hi guys thank you they all took me

124
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,850
under their wing and talking the

125
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,350
technology was a really crazy time

126
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,090
because one minute I'd be pitching an

127
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,000
investor<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the next minute I was lured</font>

128
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,890
into encode and writing snort rules and

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,510
it was fun but not something I want to

130
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,789
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to you but I have been hooked on</font>

131
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:31,240
the security industry ever since so over

132
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the years I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to travel</font>

133
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,830
the world attend conferences visit

134
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">hacker spaces and one of the things I</font>

135
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,890
love to do is ask people how they got

136
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,960
started and hacking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place</font>

137
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,909
I'm still waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to tell</font>

138
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,489
me sports marketing but what I actually

139
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,160
hear time and time again is the movies

140
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,850
and why not right the movies are cool

141
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,440
the net the Manhattan Project the matrix

142
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,750

movies while still really cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> artist</font>

147
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">school is the real life hacks that are</font>

148
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,919
happening today now trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> me movies are</font>

149
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,740
cool there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> good guys and bad</font>

150
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,628
guys the hackers fight crime governments

151
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,479
they steal corporate secrets they live

152
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:18,460
in alternate universes but today what

153
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-life hackers are doing are actually</font>

154
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,448
inspiring the movie plots of tomorrow we

155
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,780
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys hacking satellite</font>

156
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:29,979
communications ATM cards cities you name

157
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,628
it right so what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do today is</font>

158
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:33,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">share a few of the stories of the guys</font>

159
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:36,879
I've worked with who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking things</font>

160
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,580
like that so it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> that real life</font>

161
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,219
is like the movies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also need to</font>

162
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,710
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> real life isn't a movie</font>

163
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:46,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">not everything wraps up in two hours</font>

164
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,690
with pretty little bow around it right

165
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:52,539
real research is hard it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> frustrating</font>

166
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's full of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> failure and today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

167
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:56,349
actually full of<font color="#CCCCCC"> risks right we're</font>

168
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,270
seeing a trend of hackers today that are

169
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,490
taking on a type of cyber vigilantism

170
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,549
that's actually threatening the entire

171
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,949
world of research right there's a fine

172
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,560
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> between good and evil and when that</font>

173
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,930
line blurs it threatens the livelihood

174
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,360
of all the researchers we know and as

175
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,370
technology is evolving to blend to blur

176
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,039
the lines between security and safety

177
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,469
it's actually threatening the lives of

178
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,080
the people we know and love<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

187
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,690
save research why does it scare me when

188
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,669
I hear that research is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

189
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,770
coming under different laws in different

190
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:51,279
regulations and researchers threaten

191
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,500
jail time well innovation is awesome

192
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,180
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> while I seriously have no idea why</font>

196
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,599
giving sight to the blind it's

197
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,030
connecting families and it's giving us

199
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:12,359
even dreamed of yet but much like the

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,160
software industry of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 90s these new</font>

markets that are embracing these new

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,110
connected technologies have no idea what

203
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,669
security is they have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

204
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,830
risks are and they have no appreciation

205
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,680
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what researchers are trying to do</font>

206
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,940
right we have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better we have to</font>

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,220
help them and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn to</font>

208
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,020
communicate in their language so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

209
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,300
can understand the value we bring to the

210
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:38,340
table it's our job to help them not

211
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:40,829
fight them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so with all of that we</font>

212
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,950
can't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security is a game it</font>

213
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,500
scares me that as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovation is</font>

214
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,360
happening at an ever faster pace people

215
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,610
are starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that security can't</font>

216
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,650
catch up we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep up the game is</font>

217
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,530
over we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw up our hands</font>

218
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,180
and say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insecure</font>

219
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,310
why would we even want to catch up I

220
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,859
think it's our job to leapfrog all that

221
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,199
innovation and come up with new

222
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">different ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure things security</font>

223
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,640
is a game but it's definitely not a game

224
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,160
with winners and losers it's an

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,050
ever-evolving game of give and take or

226
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,510
it's our job to secure the most critical

227
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,400
assets the best way we know how right

228
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,450
that's actually the heart of what true

229
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,949
researchers do now hopefully most of you

230
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,590
have seen more games if you haven't

231
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,650
email me I'll send you a copy it's a

232
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,410
true classic and back in the 80s it

233
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:34,230
inspired legions of teenagers to hack

234
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,390
their computers and as fate would have

235
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,190
it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> girlfriend in the movie the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

236
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,840
played by ally sheedy who encourages

238
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,550
named Jennifer so I'm pretty sure that

239
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,079
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> destiny was decided even back then</font>

240
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,060
but now don't worry it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spoiler</font>

241
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,430
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the movie there's this</font>

242
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,800
great scene where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nuclear control</font>

243
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,620
computer is playing tic-tac-toe right

244
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,170
over time it<font color="#E5E5E5"> realizes nobody can win</font>

245
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,480
this game it's a no-win game and instead

246
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,670
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving up he brilliantly suggests</font>

247
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,530
they should play chess instead that's

248
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,120
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what research is all about right</font>

249
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,770
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're in a no-win game</font>

250
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,590
you have to change up your perspective

251
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,630
create a new reality change a new game

252
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,780
and create<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

253
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,350
different

254
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,910
otherwise you're just playing

255
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,260
tic-tac-toe<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right story time so what</font>

256
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've learned from</font>

a pirate so these are kind of my pirate

259
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,800
tales of things we've learned over the

260
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:33,620
years now as if inspired by the movie

261
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,810
wargames much have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing the</font>

262
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,730
game for researchers for years for those

of you that don't know much he's

264
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,110
probably best known for his work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

265
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,510
law heavy industries and is an icon in

266
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,880
helping security researchers time and

267
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:50,150
time again when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he launched the DARPA</font>

268
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,560
the DARPA cyberfest program he cut

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,959
through all the bureaucratic red tape

270
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,849
and made it possible for researchers to

271
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,090
get funding<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a safe way to</font>

Charlie Miller's car hacking so one of

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,849
the things I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these guys is</font>

277
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,530
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two of the hardest working</font>

278
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,080
people in the industry at least that I

279
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,689
know they both<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped full-time jobs</font>

280
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,920
while they were researching cars

281
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,540
initially having no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what they were</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with they couldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank</font>

283
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,819
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> being their career so they work</font>

284
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,560
nights and weekends like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a seriously</font>

285
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,660
like a little married couple talking

<font color="#CCCCCC">every day sharing information and trying</font>

to hack the cars and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely did</font>

288
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,610
right these guys hack the cars they got

289
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,810
on stage at Def Con<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they showed how</font>

290
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,290
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could control it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with one of those</font>

291
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,810
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> old school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nintendo remotes right</font>

292
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,060
it was fun stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security industry</font>

293
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,329
was inspired they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> awed everybody</font>

294
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,219
clapped yay great<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them</font>

295
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,340
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just the tip of the</font>

296
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,380
iceberg they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting started</font>

297
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,930
after that they went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release a</font>

298
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,700
series of tools and resources that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

299
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,010
it possible for legions of hackers

300
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,170
around the world to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved not</font>

301
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,880
everybody has Mudge or an employer

302
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,380
buying them cars every year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

303
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,540
these tools you guys can all get

304
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,340
involved in hacking cars without having

305
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,740
to have a live car

306
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,180
but they also knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was important</font>

307
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,100
to be able to demonstrate what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

308
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,569
done to a wider audience it's all great

309
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,740
when we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other and share</font>

310
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we do but we all speak the same</font>

311
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,030

of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> around us tends to not know</font>

313
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,470
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about half the time</font>

314
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,320
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they knew they wanted to show</font>

315
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,090
visually how they could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car so</font>

316
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,830
they teamed up with Andy Greenberg and

317
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,140
they got behind the wheel of a car and

318
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:42,380
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced his car off the road up on</font>

319
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,750
the curb into the bushes hearing him

320

321
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,090
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key was they had</font>

322
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,890
his permission right guys it's really

323
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,870
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can break</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of rules</font>

324
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,790
you can do awesome stuff but if you

325
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,140
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it without breaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the law if</font>

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,110
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> him a lot of fun but they were fun</font>

335
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">and educational but more importantly</font>

336
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:23,150
they caught the eye of mainstream media

337
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:26,089
like Carson Daly sorry now pretty sure

338
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristen's highlight of his life was</font>

339
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,710
being photobombed by Carson Daly after

340
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,660
they film their today's show segment but

341
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,180
for me what was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool about it was</font>

342
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,630
they had reached the consumer audience

343
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,390
right when Carson Daly is talking about

344
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,460
cars not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe it makes parents</font>

345
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going into the car dealerships asking</font>

346
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,440
about security features for their kids

347
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,719
car right consumer reports today is

348
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,670
using security as a metric for how they

349
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,960
rank the cars right that's how you push

350
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the needle forward in the industry</font>

351
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,620
you've got to reach a wider audience

352
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,540
you've got to hit the people who care

353
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,490
you've got to hit the people who hit the

354
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,319
bottom line<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the manufacturers and the</font>

358
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,520
amazing stories but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

359
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,760
two of them that I think are relevant to

360
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,550
what we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today now</font>

361
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,319
Barnes is under

362
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,359
we wanted to top ten percent of the

363
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,130
world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> most brilliant hackers right he</font>

364
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,779
was always<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at new things and</font>

365
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,570
trying to come up with creative ways to

366
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:30,149
break them and back<font color="#E5E5E5"> before anyone was</font>

367
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,339
talking about ATM security he knew he

368
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,829
wanted to break these things so he did

369
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:37,070
what any of us would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great roll on up</font>

370
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:40,920
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bar and start hacking away at one</font>

371
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:43,350
no he actually went on ebay pot of you

372
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adam delivered to his apartment and told</font>

373
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,970
his girlfriend that is because he didn't

374
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:51,660
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay ATM fees anymore right we</font>

375
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">would all do that now the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> results were</font>

376
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,699
legendary Barnaby is legendary right he

377
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,310
jackpot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ATM he made money spit</font>

378
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,680
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage in Vegas and he made money</font>

379
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,319
spit out on CNN<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the world was</font>

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,579
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Barnaby is he actually really</font>

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">cared about the security of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> devices</font>

383
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,920
the flashy black hat talk wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

384
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,050
goal for him he had literally spent

385
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,880
months behind the scenes working with

386
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,920
the vendors making sure they were ready

387
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">for his talk and they were all in the</font>

388
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">front row of his talk and by his side</font>

389
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,700
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the press briefing afterwards and</font>

390
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,470
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's all best summed up by Henry</font>

391
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,140
Schwartz actually works at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triton one of</font>

392
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,149
the one of the ATMs that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage</font>

393
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,459
with Barnaby and Henry was sitting right

394
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,470
next to me during the top and afterwards

395
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">he sort of chronicled his experience</font>

396
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,640
working with Barnaby right and he said

397
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,700
what mattered most to him was that

398
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,000
Barnaby had<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Triton before</font>

399
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,440
publishing and trust me when he did they

400
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,290
did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

401
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,320
terrified<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has a whole blog they</font>

402
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,180
called him a swashbuckler didn't even

403
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,800
know we call ioactive people pirates but

404
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,930
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of cool and</font>

405
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,359
Henry actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspired the title of the</font>

406
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,029
top Jack potting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATMs because he thought</font>

407
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's what Barnaby was doing but</font>

408
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,540
Barney we flew out met with them talked

409
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,829
about all the technical details<font color="#E5E5E5"> walked</font>

410
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">them through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and was</font>

411
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:17,519
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for any questions</font>

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they had and then when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they asked</font>

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">him to delay his talk he agreed it was</font>

414
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,110
important to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him at some</font>

415
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,630
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> making progress he was going</font>

416
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to wait until more ATMs were patched</font>

417
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,340
before going live and then when he did

418
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,950
go alive he didn't disclose<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

419
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,020
attack ATMs he talked about the

420
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,550
vulnerabilities he talked about the

421
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,740
significance and he talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

422
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,270
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> he told the world what was wrong</font>

423
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,760
without telling them how to recreate

424
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,770
what he had done and so Henry on his

425
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,710
blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> States it best when he said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Barnaby</font>

426
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,689
and I started as adversaries and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended</font>

427
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,160
his friends right researchers have a

00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,080
chance to do this but you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

429
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,089
patient you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to talk with people</font>

430
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,040
don't be scared<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they're scared of</font>

431
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:01,910
you day one right we can turn these

432
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,159
folks around now well Barnaby and I were

433
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">never adversaries we were definitely</font>

434
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,930
friends long before he came a pirate the

435
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,900
first time right so as friends he knew

436
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dad my dad he knew about my</font>

437
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:17,660
dad's battle with heart disease and

438
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,880
implantable medical devices three

439
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,220
product recalls had forced my dad to

440
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,320
undergo surgery three separate times to

441
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,990
have these devices replaced all right

442
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,550
Barnaby saw this and realized you know

443
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,920
rolling out patches to these new

444
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,050
connected devices is not as simple as a

445
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">software upgrade right these things</font>

446
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,550
really impacted real people it was scary

447
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">going under the knife is scary for all</font>

448
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,440
of us but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a bad heart it's</font>

449
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,460
a pretty significant undertaking so as

450
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,080
he ventured out to start his research in

451
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,590
medical device he asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he could meet</font>

452
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,720
my dad so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hopped on a plane flew out</font>

453
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,030
to New York and had lunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> Papa stuff and</font>

454
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,790
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically SAT there for five or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

455
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:01,820
hours hilariously laughing if you've met

456
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,770
Barnaby he's quite the<font color="#E5E5E5"> jokester we're he</font>

457
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,750
dug in with my dad on all aspects of

458
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it was like to be an end user of</font>

459
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,550
medical devices could you feel the

460
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,590
device did it hurt what's the surgery

461
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,210
like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recovery like what</font>

462
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,280
features are important to you do you

463
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,190
even know why it's connected do you even

464
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,899
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's connected to he asked</font>

465
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,670
everything he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know everything</font>

466
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,560
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to have</font>

467
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,880
these medical devices so he could make

468
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,919
them safer right

469
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,800
now all the fame<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fortune being on</font>

470
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,590
CNN being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Forbes magazine was</font>

471
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,190
secondary farda me wanted is research to

472
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:42,010
impact real people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it did right this</font>

473
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,660
is an episode of Homeland his research

474
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,900
was featured in an episode of Homeland

475
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,820
but they demonstrated that hacking a

476
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,940
medical device could actually cause an

477
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,220
assassination of a leader a very minor

478
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,380
stretch in the technical terms of what

479
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,990
could really happen easily but once

480
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,880
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> message hit the general</font>

481
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,760
population and people were talking about

482
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,310
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right today medical device</font>

483
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,590
manufacturers are undergoing security

484
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:11,740
testing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA is talking about</font>

485
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,480
security testing right regulations are

486
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,880
rolling out and people are taking notice

487
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,580
we still have a long long way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font>

488
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,860
make these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices safer but people are</font>

489
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,050
paying attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> change is happening and</font>

490
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,159
luckily for me Barnaby didn't have to

491
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:30,790
practice any<font color="#E5E5E5"> life hacks on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top of stuff</font>

492
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay at i/o active we definitely work</font>

493
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,090
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

494
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,070
manufacturers we have some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

495
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,679
new gadgets and tablets and things in

496
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,379
our lab if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys get to tear apart</font>

497
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,180
see what's wrong with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them cool stuff</font>

498
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,860
but for some folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mobile's mobile and</font>

499
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,410
why would I care about hacking text

500
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,320
communications when I can hack satellite

501
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,910
systems right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture is</font>

502
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,889
actually the view when I got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape</font>

503
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,840
down to the Caribbean for a few weeks

504
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,750
and float where the real pirates flute

505
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,820
and I knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reuben Santa Marta was</font>

506
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,860
working on satellite communication

507
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,050
hacking but I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly when</font>

508
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,600
it was coming so as I'm floating wrong I

509
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,000
get the preliminary report from him and

510
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,030
I start reading it and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was terrifying</font>

511
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,580
right as i look as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm reading it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I look</font>

512
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,590
up and I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the same device he's</font>

513
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,659
managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack is the device i have on</font>

514
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,419
board the<font color="#E5E5E5"> milano to keep me connected to</font>

515
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,390
the mothership while we're floating rmc

516
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,650
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention</font>

517
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly hacking my holiday this was</font>

518
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,950
scary stuff and the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> he found were</font>

519
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,389
frightening on

520
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:37,029
documented protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard-coded</font>

521
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:39,219
passwords backdoors you name it he could

522
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,850
hack every system he got his hands on

523
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:46,269
right this was scary stuff I actually at

524
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:48,730
one point looked up and said rubén can

525
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:52,179
you hear me I was totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced he'd</font>

526
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,889
hack the boat<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

527
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:55,690
floating in paradise I asked ribbon when

528
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:57,879
are we going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be ready to release we</font>

529
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,090
care a lot about responsible disclosure

530
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,860
and try to make every effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to</font>

531
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,840
work with the vendors and manufacturers

532
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,029
to make sure that fixes are in place and

533
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,799
I knew that Reuben I've been working

534
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:10,330
with ICS certain of some of the cert

535
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,158

horror when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found out only one vendor</font>

539
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:22,120
had even ever responded to us everybody

work for a vendor if you work for a

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,429
manufacturer and a researcher is

knocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your front door</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to</font>

guys don't knock on the front door don't

551
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,990
be afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the researchers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

552

553
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:56,559
guys and girls have big hearts so only

554
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">one vendor had responded and we were</font>

555
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,010
nervous I mean at this point if they

556
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,590
didn't understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuben could be</font>

557
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,919
hacking the Milano from Spain forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

558
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,559
the things that matter for oil rigs the

559
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,500
military emergency systems that all

560
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,480
relied on these communications we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

561
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,690
terrified so we decided we were going to

562
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,760
go public with our research but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reuben</font>

563
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,760
spent quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time packaging up</font>

564
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,309
the right report to go public with just

565
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,929
like the car hacking it was the impact

566
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:29,740
that mattered and not the technical

567
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:31,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">details right so we wrote the report we</font>

568
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,760
made the decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to release</font>

569
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,129
literally within hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

570
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">listening the vendors and manufacturers</font>

571
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,500
were calling us the end users were

of innovation where the executives

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,590
actually invited him into a closed-door

579
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,470
session so he can present his research

583
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,370
a pretty big win considering everything

<font color="#E5E5E5">going on with hacking planes today all</font>

589
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,160
that I've learned in this industry is

590
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:30,580
that change takes time we're often

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,350
steering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Titanic guys we can't</font>

can't get frustrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the slow pace we</font>

little things and all those small steps

599
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,540
along the way they lead to pretty

600
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:54,939
radical change so back in 2008 before

601
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,670
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us including me knew what the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">meters being put on houses in our</font>

604
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,540
neighborhoods and they scare the bejesus

605
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,730
out of us we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

607
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:14,050
was rotten in Denmark so we went on<font color="#CCCCCC"> eBay</font>

608
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,210
side note yes eBay is your friends for

609
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,330
security researchers everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

610
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,530
one of us starts talking about

611
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,840
vulnerabilities and systems pretty much

612
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,580
everything is<font color="#CCCCCC"> available on eBay once the</font>

613
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,350
press catches wind of it it becomes a

little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit harder but medical devices</font>

615
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,169
ATMs smart meters we got our first round

616
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">on ebay every time go poke around a</font>

617
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,520
little me you might get inspired by some

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can break</font>

619
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,280
so we picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a few of these devices</font>

620
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,260
often Bay and Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jase Mike Davis and</font>

Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> Larsen two of our principal</font>

622
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,600
researchers went to town hacking up and

623
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,159
boy did they hack on these things were

624
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,169
vulnerable like nothing we had seen

625
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,330
before and our guys wrote a

626
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,580
proof-of-concept worm that showed how we

627
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,340
could shut down city's power in a matter

628
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,370
of minutes it was pretty scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and</font>

629
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,350
so in an effort to make sure that this

630
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,739
proof-of-concept never became a reality

631
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,959
we all boarded the plane for DC to

632
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,150
attend what is still probably one of the

633
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,970
most intimidating meetings of my

broken that the worm is going to shut

638

down a city and yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should trust us</font>

639
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,710
were actually the good guys and they

listened we left<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind a brief that was</font>

641
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,990
later read by Obama and we were invited

642
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,560
into discussions to roll out regulations

643
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,080
to discuss how manufacturers should be

securing devices to discuss how rollouts

645
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,649
may or may not need to be delayed people

646
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,130
were listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> change definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't</font>

647

leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world in smart grid security</font>

when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meters come into our lab today</font>

654
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,920
without even leaving a mark they're

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff to be</font>

657
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,409
system and if you do that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means the</font>

658
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,570
barrier is higher which means the

659
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,690
likelihood of hack is lower that's real

660
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,149
progress right again<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's still work</font>

661
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:26,790
that needs to be done but<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress is</font>

being made so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Caesar cerrito ctrio</font>

664
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,490
kind of changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game changing the</font>

665
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,870
way we think and changing the way we

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,170
approach these things

667
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,969
right we're hackers we all think

668
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,650
everything needs to be hacked everything

669
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,150
needs to be broken we've got to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

670
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,030
the vulnerability or you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

671
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,470
believe us right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Caesars caking kind</font>

672
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,260
of a different more forward-looking

673
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,180
approach he just created a new

674

initiative called securing smart cities

675
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,870
the nonprofit consortium where we

676
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,410
brought together researchers from around

677
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:00,300
the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> burski labs steel networks the</font>

cloud security alliance<font color="#CCCCCC"> and exhibitor</font>

679
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,309
are among a few of the early guys taking

680
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:08,160
part and here's the key as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

681
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:10,290
we've already proven cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart meters</font>

682
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,020
traffic signals the Internet of Things

683
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,270
the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes on and on we have proven</font>

684
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this stuff is broken it's</font>

685
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,200
all hackable it's all vulnerable

686
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,360
everybody knows it<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody admits it</font>

687
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,580
so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would we have to hack Smart City</font>

688
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,070
just to prove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 wrongs don't make</font>

689
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,439
a right all we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is combining a</font>

690
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,870
whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken technology rolling</font>

691
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,940
it out and calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it smart right we</font>

692
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,550
shouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take down a small city</font>

693
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,190
in order to be able to prove smart

694
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:40,260
cities have vulnerabilities right we

695
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,940
should be striving to be thought leaders

696
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,530
we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've learned</font>

697
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,850
over the years what we know about

698
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,830
software what we know about

699
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,620
vulnerabilities but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

700
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,840
hacking and warning people before it's

701
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,389
too late right we don't need to show

702
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,300
that everything has been hacked in order

703
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it can be had right</font>

704
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:02,220
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> researchers have gotten a big</font>

705
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,530
voice everybody has proven a whole lot

706
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff along the way right we don't</font>

707
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,990
need to constantly be proving ourselves

708
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:11,700
so it's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> caesars doing we're</font>

709
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,460
actually taking a much more thought

710
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,270
leadership approach and again no lives

711
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:21,300
are put in risk no laws are being broken

712
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:23,220
right and they're communicating they've

713
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,250
literally caught the ear of smart city

714
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,870
governments around the world and people

715
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,120
are actually coming together in a few

<font color="#CCCCCC">months to discuss ways in which we can</font>

717
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,449
actually secure the smart cities before

725
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:57,408
the rules but it's critical we remember

726
00:28:54,049 --> 00:29:00,200
to brake only the right rules don't harm

727
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:02,779
people don't break laws I can't advocate

728
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,630
for breaking laws and have some fun
