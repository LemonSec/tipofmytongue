being here i'm mark painter I'm a

security evangelist with HP enterprise

00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:28,279
security products how that translates as

5
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,140
I'm basically our primary security

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,609
blogger I'll give you only later because

00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,650
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else I am a shameless</font>

00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:39,440
appreciate that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow back today</font>

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,589
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to talk about a year in the</font>

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,329
life of HP security research now what

13
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:46,070
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean except</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the fact that</font>

14
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,050
I liked the Beatles well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that</font>

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,430
HP does a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different things and a</font>

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,919
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas and we try to</font>

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,269
present a big picture of security mean

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,070
and what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about today</font>

19
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the research we've done and</font>

20
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,660
to discovering vulnerabilities a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,190
the things we try to give organizations

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,529
to help them prioritize where to spend

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,860
their budgets because security budgets

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,390
are limited as I'm sure each of you know

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,289
and some other just things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of general</font>

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,560
interest that I think you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

27
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:14,960
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right but before I dig</font>

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,700
into some of a proprietary research and

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,750
some of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've done I'd like</font>

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:31,520
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talk a little bit about if i can</font>

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward the slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here to work with me I</font>

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,330
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to for a second about</font>

33
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:39,800
how we frame what we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight so this is</font>

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,599
what we call the attack life something

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might recognize this as a kill chain</font>

36
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,420
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar and this is how we try</font>

37
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:49,789
to prioritize what we research and what

38
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:53,239
we do and basically what we do is we

39
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:55,220
define an adversarial marketplace and

40
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:58,640
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what us in the security</font>

41
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">industry are up against and this is</font>

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually how we break down how attacks</font>

43
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,670
actually occur in the world real world

44
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,009
first there's research into potential

45
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,399
targets in this day and age that

46
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:12,110
conclude that includes building profiles

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,300
from social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media just think about</font>

48
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,700
what's available from you just from a

49
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,430
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google search these profiles are</font>

50
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,790
now for corporate executives in whom

51
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,319
have you are available online for sale

52
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,630
this can include<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumpster diving I'd</font>

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,160
find information necessary to conduct

engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks</font>

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,310
now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these are broken out all of</font>

57
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,640
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are monetized now so any part of</font>

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,550
this the information or the skill or the

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,339
tool necessary to successfully

60
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,500
perpetrate an attack is available

61
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">infiltration that's all about creating</font>

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,580
access points into a network this is

63
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,160
where phishing attacks social

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,420

66
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,459
that environment from those access

67
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,920
points that have been discovered that's

68
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically let's create a treasure map I</font>

69
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,510
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then go and sell that to the highest</font>

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,760
bidder on the internet a capture that's

71
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,560
all about obtaining the data and

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,049
sometimes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a system that's</font>

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,270
under control exfiltration damage that's

74
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,280
when you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

76
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and of course monetization now</font>

77
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes this can be vertical it could</font>

78
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,820
be all one person but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found that</font>

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">specialists can actually make more money</font>

80
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,989
if they concentrate on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one specific area</font>

81
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,990
of this so what I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

82
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:36,200
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the research that we do as HP</font>

83
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,760
is a basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first three parts the</font>

84
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,980
research the filtration the discovery

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,980
phases and what we do to counter those

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,570
slides don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to work with me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

87
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we do a lot of different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at HP</font>

88
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,100
in the security research thing and this

89
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">is some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover in</font>

90
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">this presentation every year in February</font>

91
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,670
it used to be timed with RSA but our

92
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,670
same was in April this year so we're

93
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,880
early we do a risk report a cyber risk

94
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:19,130
report we do studies in conjunction with

95
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,010
the Ponemon Institute a lot of vendors

96
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,780
use poem because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're been</font>

97
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,010
dragged<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gnostic for one and which means</font>

98
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically it will take anybody's money</font>

99
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,659
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> research but they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

100
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,120
they they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do simple survey</font>

101
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,650
questions let's put it that way the zero

102
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,230
day initiative we use some statistics

103
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,390
from for them that's a bounty program

104
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,979
that we pay ethical researchers or

105
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,870
vulnerability information previously

106
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,609
undisclosed

107
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,510
we do a state of security operations

108
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,220
report this year are<font color="#CCCCCC"> for phione demand</font>

109
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,170
group our researchers did an Internet of

110
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,140
Things research study and there's some

111
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,420
other groups price services HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Labs that</font>

112
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,570
we pull information and data from right

113
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,810
to create this overall view of what we

114
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,800
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year and security research</font>

115
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright let's go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and dig in with</font>

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,210
some stats from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ponemon report and i</font>

117
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,309
pulled out to stats off the top that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

118
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,370
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really indicative of where we</font>

119
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,350
are as an industry since 2009 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

120
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,530
to resolve an attack has grown a hundred

121
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,460
and thirty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a lot of the</font>

122
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you today</font>

123
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,640
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to validate what you</font>

124
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,500
already know or what you might already

125
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,210
just feel in your heart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that</font>

126
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,550
security is getting much much<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder</font>

127
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,640
it's just it grows more complicated

128
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,440
every year the old stuff has not been

129
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,140
secured we keep putting new stuff on top

130
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it and things just keep getting it</font>

131
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,110
seems infinitely worse and I don't know

132
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've quite hit bottom yet either</font>

133
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:54,710
another interesting stat I we gathered

134
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,860
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the podium on studies is it now on</font>

135
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,020
average takes 229 days to detect a

136
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,880
breach that is a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for somebody</font>

137
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be inside your network before you</font>

138
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,030
know they're there that's that's

139
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:11,750
increased over the years as well I'll

140
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,150
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stat up in a second too so you</font>

141
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,040
know it used to be you know 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

142
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,810
nobody cared about staying undetected it

143
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,110
was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know all about a one-time score</font>

144
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,810
get in get out be loud who cares but as

145
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:27,700
we all know today it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more I</font>

146
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the key word there is persistent</font>

147
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:36,170
so we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using ponymon from a</font>

148
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,530
number of years if you'll notice one

149
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,310
specific thing about all these numbers

150
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,340
they're all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the wrong direction</font>

151
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,700
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they all get worse every year so</font>

152
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,869
think back to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier sad 229 days</font>

153
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:53,120
inside a for breach is detected the time

154
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,689
to resolve that average is 45 days I

155
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,119
mean that isn't

156
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,889
absolutely long time for somebody to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

157
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:02,369
only be in but then to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix the</font>

158
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:05,759
problem so for the pony when let me back

159
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:07,829
up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second we actually it it's</font>

160
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,449
international<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you links to</font>

161
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:12,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this stuff later but the stats i'm</font>

162
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:15,029
using now from 59 benchmarked us

163
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:18,449
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it varies in size i</font>

164
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,789
would say it evenly split half of the

165
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,969
enterprises that we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull data from</font>

166
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:27,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">have over 20,000 seats and the rest or</font>

167
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:29,339
below that the tax per week those are

168
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:33,329
actually successful attacks those aren't

169
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:35,969
just attacks per se so these

170
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations average 138 successful</font>

171
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:41,129
attacks per week with a cost of 12.7

172
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:44,669
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> for organization and that's</font>

173
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:49,709
that's a super huge increase from 2010

174
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:54,089
when it was only 3.8 million and that's

175
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:55,799
a cost of increased<font color="#E5E5E5"> 96% if you didn't do</font>

176
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,209
the math i'll do it for it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

177
00:07:55,799 --> 00:08:00,828
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful attacks that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

178
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,829
and forty-four percent increase

179
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,580
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I started pretending</font>

180
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,169
these slides were very smooth I don't

181
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,099
know why it's taken five seconds to go

182
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:17,090
between slides but that's my burden I

183
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:19,520
just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you this slide to</font>

184
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,580
show you the actual numbers as you can

185
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,000
see of course there's quite a range the

186
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,550
minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know ranges from 1.6 million</font>

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,639
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum of 60 million so there's</font>

188
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,799
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a range so I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you</font>

189
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:46,250
some more insight<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that 12.8 million</font>

190
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:47,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">number so so these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually some of</font>

191
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,180
the type of attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

192
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations saw in the study up I</font>

193
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,279
don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys might see the same types</font>

194
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,779
of things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization everybody</font>

195
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,980
is a hit with viruses worms and trojans

196
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:03,500
and malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> not everybody is with the</font>

197
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,880
denial of service attack of stolen

198
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,610
devices or things of that nature

199
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">web-based attack 61 percent of the</font>

200
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,890
organization's sell those now keep these

201
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,180
numbers in mind because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in terms of</font>

202
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,449
the next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides I'm going to</font>

203
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,449
show you

204
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,920
anything there we go so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

205
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:36,130
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the blue is actually</font>

206
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,079
enterprises above 20,000 seats and the

207
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,870
red<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually goes below so you can</font>

208
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,359
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> their different costs for the</font>

209
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">different size of the organization the</font>

210
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,760
cost of tax versus organizational sighs

211
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:51,699
so bigger organizations I have a lot

212
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,639
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost from denial of service attack</font>

213
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:57,639
smaller organizations not so much on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

214
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,740
coppers smaller organizations have more

215
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,170
costs associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> web-based attacks</font>

216
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,779
and tote fishing in social engineering

217
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,250
so depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the size of your</font>

218
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,870
organization that might give you an idea

219
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:12,430
of where you might best prioritize your

220
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,959
spending so in small organizations to

221
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">occur significantly higher per capita</font>

222
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,069
costs and higher order than larger

223
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,260
organizations social security incidents

224
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a large organization actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

225
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">down to five hundred seventeen dollars</font>

226
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:27,670
per incident but for small organizations

227
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's 1513 so there's some definite</font>

228
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:34,569
differences in the costs associated so

229
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,769
the small guys usually do wind up taking

230
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:47,199
it on the chin a little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font>

231
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">big guys so again thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

232
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:51,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw in the terms of cost this</font>

233
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,889
is where organizations are actually over

234
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,599
these 59 benchmarked organizations

235
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,279
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent their money and this</font>

236
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
especially if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

237
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,899
layer numbers think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give you some</font>

238
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,040
statistics later from a different report

239
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:08,019
that should make you think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

240
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,660
everybody's obviously spending them most

241
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their money on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network layer but</font>

242
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,500
other data<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have shows that might not</font>

243
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,880
be actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best place to to spend</font>

244
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,649
that money firewalls are tricky<font color="#E5E5E5"> though a</font>

245
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,500
recent study I read said that only four

246
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,300
percent of organizations think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

247
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">less critical than before thirty-four</font>

248
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,240
percent things were actually more

249
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,920
critical you know everybody Knox

250
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,209
firewalls but nobody's ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw</font>

251
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,000
them away yet either because we don't

252
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,589
really have anything yet to replace them

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,300
it's like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always give the</font>

254
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,170
knowledge you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a knock down my walls</font>

255
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,579
because I saw

256
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:49,839
and on the floor you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're still</font>

257
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:51,719
doing their job all right let's talk

258
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the risk report a little bit oh</font>

259
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,839
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be heavily involved with the</font>

260
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk board not so much anymore but I</font>

261
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,519
still like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about it we started</font>

262
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">this actually in 2009 it was a</font>

263
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,260
publication of a DV laughs digital

264
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:09,189
vaccine labs it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> grown now to</font>

265
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,350
become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> primary research piece that</font>

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,089
like I said we publish it in the

268
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:20,889
conjunction with the RSA security

269
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:22,180
conference it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really grown in</font>

270
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,570
something something good it gets a lot

271
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,560
of coverage and it really is a showcase

272
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

dig in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more in-depth information in</font>

276
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:44,019
it I'm sorry much slide transitions are

277
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,380
driving me nuts otherwise probably

278
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:49,269
anyway our key finding number one

279
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,860
well-known attacks are still incredibly

280
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:58,209
common place and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font>

281
00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:01,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">just how so that is and these numbers</font>

282
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:04,899
come from our zero day initiative you

283
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:07,390
know you obviously heard of black hats

284
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:09,910
and white hats we call zdi it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

285
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,589
a gray area so they are ethical security

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,959

299
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,740
here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

300
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:57,060
old technology is still incredibly

301
00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:02,310
vulnerable and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one key</font>

302
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:06,030
takeaway from that comprehensive

303
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:09,119
patching strategy it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

304
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:11,339
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get right and sometimes it's not</font>

305
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,530
always convenient to install a patch I

306
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,360
think the key word here is comprehensive

307
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,220
because you can't always patch it if you

308
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,050
can't patch well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> better hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

309
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,790
block you can't block you better hope

310
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,240
you can at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least quarantine in some</font>

311
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:27,420
matter this is this is just a huge huge

312
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,910
issue in fact up I think something like

313
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,620
half of all implementations that were

314
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,540
vulnerable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> heart bleed or still</font>

315
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,950
vulnerable I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw</font>

316
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm sure that's changed up a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

318
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,460
that's okay sometimes not everything

319
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,810
needs the same level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of protection of</font>

320
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,610
but sometimes you know for

<font color="#E5E5E5">business-critical things yeah it</font>

322
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:56,670
absolutely does matter another key

323
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:59,430
finding and this one actually was very

324
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,439
surprising misconfigurations are still a

325
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,880
significant problem and these are these

326
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,030
are statistics that come from testing

327
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,750
web applications we tested over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6500 web</font>

328
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:12,930
applications from our in testing team or

329
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,510
final demand and then so these these are

330
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,569
actually really I trust these numbers

331
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:21,720
because not only that our original in

332
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,490
testers and services providers validate

333
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,350
them then our research group also took a

334
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,730
look at them to pull out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers for</font>

335
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,850
the risk report so these have actually

336
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:34,910
been validated twice and what this

337
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:37,200
actually is defined as is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

338
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,589
access to files of directories that

339
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,970
should not be publicly available some

340
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,220
other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> cookie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security is always</font>

341
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or still a significant problem</font>

342
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,890
system information leaks of cross frame

343
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,080
scripting still seeing was seen in

344
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:56,670
forty-eight percent of the applications

345
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,750
that's a huge number up so I have a bit

346
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">of cold so I'm getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of breath</font>

347
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,780
here

348
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:06,979
so when stat that isn't on here another

349
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty-seven percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the applications</font>

350
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,690
we're vulnerable to cross-site scripting

351
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,220
or some flavor or another you know

352
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,920
reflected or<font color="#E5E5E5"> persistent primarily</font>

353
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,709
reflective as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you as you would</font>

354
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,740
imagine so you know cross-site scripting

355
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:23,268
is basically been around for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 years</font>

356
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,810
it's almost been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as the</font>

357
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:29,269
web itself so and that's if there's

358
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,449
anything it's that we see keep seeing

359
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:34,760
the same mistakes over and over and over

360
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,670
it's like best practices have yet to

361
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,260
really sink in either from a development

362
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:44,420
perspective or from an implementation

363
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:47,450
perspective is so it definitely

364
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:52,130
complicates security efforts when you

365
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,870
can't get the simple things right and I

366
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,850
really did I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised by</font>

367
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the server misconfigurations</font>

368
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,769
not bugs and coat of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most common</font>

security problem facing enterprises

370
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,299
today I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely thought it</font>

371
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,780
would still be bugs and code but it's

372
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:11,869
not and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you would think that a</font>

373
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,569
2015 people would know how to configure

374
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:17,688
things properly but it's still a huge

375
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:20,688
huge issue our key finding number three

376
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,890
was that newer technologies such as

377
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,870
mobile I don't know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can really</font>

378
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,240
call mobile new<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore especially since</font>

381
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,970
introduces new avenues of attack I think

382
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,820
it's a truism in the security industry

383
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,220
that the introduction of new technology

384
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,659
invariably also introduces security

385
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,270
vulnerabilities I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is</font>

388
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,130
did another study completely devoted

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:52,730

malware

393
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,310
I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another just indication</font>

394
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:12,890
of how bad mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware is getting</font>

395
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:14,750
there now 1 million unique malicious

396
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,640
apps known today granted some of those

397
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,550
are windows see I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think we're</font>

398
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,240
going to see too much manipulation of

399
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:25,460
that anymore obviously this is geared

400
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,440
towards Android there's been an

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,270
explosion<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Android malware what we</font>

403
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,680
from this 2014 was really the year that

404
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,840
mobile malware stop just being a

405

more<font color="#CCCCCC"> dangerous for web applications are</font>

408

this isn't quite as popular here I think

425
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:34,280
the scary one is is we saw a lot of you

432
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:52,790
and what's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin so that that was</font>

433
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,790
actually pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary there's some</font>

434
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,370
obvious differences between still web

435
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,139
application and mobile application

436
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,520
vulnerabilities but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

437
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they were we found that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

438
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:08,150
more similar than I think I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

439
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,679
I think a big problem if you'll see

440
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,270
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one in both the security features</font>

441
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,100
ninety-seven percent of the mobile apps

442
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:16,129
we tested has some kind of

443
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,928
security feature vulnerability I think a

444
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of that I don't think mobile</font>

445
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:23,059
developers still know how to implement

446
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:27,409
the security settings that are there the

447
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:31,660
iOS data permissions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android either I</font>

448
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,660
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's causing the big issue</font>

449
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,178
obviously errors on mobile phones it's

450
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,709
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big an issue I don't know that</font>

451
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,740
I've ever seen a mobile phone error and

452
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,809
actually it courts and web app still

453
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">does a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very bad to reveal information</font>

454
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:49,760
that shouldn't be revealed a good

455
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,039
quality actually was a little surprising

456
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that it was more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an issue but</font>

457
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,650
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I'll back this up</font>

458
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,450
later with some more set but when quoted

459
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,130
code quality issues do happen then you

460
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,049
get really nasty stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sequel</font>

461
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:13,280
injection so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something you can</font>

462
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:17,150
take lightly either one day this will

463
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,710
transition the takeaway here not only is

464
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,450
new technology introduced new attack

465
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,820
surfaces and other security challenges

466
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,230
you know developers still make those

467
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,189
mistakes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world of traditional</font>

468
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:30,080
computing has already figured out i can

469
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:34,460
probably argue either way on that that

470
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,949
last one especially if if you think

471
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,559
about network level vulnerabilities of a

472
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:43,669
lot of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess it depends on what</font>

473
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:48,530
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stack you're at another key</font>

474
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:49,909
finding from this year's report and i

475
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you something you know probably</font>

476
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:56,830
just from watching the news is that

477
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:01,850
determined adversaries are our pearl of

478
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:05,658
proliferating um basically what i like

479
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:08,980
to say this means is that everyone well

480
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:11,240
everyone's pissed off for one thing uh

481
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,299
well let's just start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation-states</font>

482
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,429
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I i looked at the headline on</font>

483
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,230
USA Today<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've left outside my hotel</font>

484
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:19,700
room today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all I saw was China hacks</font>

485
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,030
I don't even know what they're accused

486
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,870
of doing now Russia just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apparently</font>

487
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hack the IRS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

488
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,830
but but it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

489
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's you think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> North Korea going</font>

490
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,909
against Sony but any organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

491
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,640
takes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> public stance of any kind it's</font>

492
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:38,430
gonna see end up taking a tax for people

493
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,309
who have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other agenda it's just it's</font>

494
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:45,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">really it's it's almost a societal thing</font>

495
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:48,840
as much as anything else but I think the

496
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:53,669
key word there is determined so everyone

497
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,530
has an agenda and they're both<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

498
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,660
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> both all the new vulnerabilities</font>

499
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,420
to penetrate all traditional levels of

500
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">defense so it's not only really how</font>

501
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,770
global of that might it might affect

502
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,290
your organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's even you</font>

503
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,970
know national events it's it's basically

504
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,490
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that you can do that</font>

505
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,500
might offend somebody well then you're

506
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,830
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get blowback and some of that</font>

507
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:20,880
blowback will come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a heightened</font>

508
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:25,980
security incidents in fact we actually

509
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,840
had we do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of we've published a</font>

510
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,360
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually three reports important</font>

511
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this year's we did one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on Iran Iranian</font>

512
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,500
hackers that's before but this year's

513
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,990
report actually had a very interesting

514
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,059
section on Turkish hackers which the

515
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,730
State Department asked us to remove so

516
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:48,629
we did because ostensibly turkey is our

517
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:51,720
ally so sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

518
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,920
key finding a secure coding continues to

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,210
pose challenges years after<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

in the industry if you remember the sea

522
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:00,890
sir statistic what was it forty-eight

523

and white listing how many how many

528
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,000
vulnerabilities can be prevented just by

529
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,500
following those<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple concepts yet you</font>

530
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,330
know there's a development mindset and

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,550
there's a cure security bite set and

532
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,649
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily run in the same</font>

537
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:39,120
finally reached a tipping point on this

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,879
in security has seeped into the public

541

way over here I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation with</font>

even they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are aware of security so I</font>

544
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,669
hope that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of this starts</font>

even developers and everyone else will

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,790
start considering more you know there's

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,830
long long time ago a web application

559
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,660
security company and we used to you know

560
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the early 2000s we had to convince</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was actually an issue</font>

562
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:35,460
and apart from financial rooms is like

563
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,280
why do I care<font color="#E5E5E5"> well now people at least</font>

564
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,040
care they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to know what to do</font>

565
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,350
so that actually gives a point of

566
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,060
optimism for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> huger future that it's</font>

567
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,949
gotten so bad it can only go up from

568
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:54,419
there sometimes people do call me

569
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:57,600
cynical I will admit that up just just

570
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,250
like I say a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things still</font>

571
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,010
stem from a relatively small number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

common programming errors validation of

575
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:22,650
this is very huge well one day it will

576
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,160
transition ah there we go nope sorry i'm

577
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">not i'm not going to throw in I promise</font>

578
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,850
and this sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot of common</font>

579
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,040
sense but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's amazing how many</font>

580
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,139
people don't understand this

581
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">complimentary protections fill out</font>

582
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,950
coverage you yes we do make firewalls

583
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,100
but you can not if you're going to

584
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:48,780
depend on on that is your sole source of

585
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,939
protection good luck<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this is actually</font>

586
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,889
something I

587
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're too when I went when I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

588
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:55,250
people there are two huge concerns that

589
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">i always hear i'll talk about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

590
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:01,190
one later but the second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

591
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:03,230
whenever I do a report somebody's got to

592
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,759
win you know vendor X and vendor why

593
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,019
there are reports they don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

594
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,850
the same language<font color="#E5E5E5"> and defining</font>

595
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,080
vulnerabilities so how am I supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

596
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,120
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> these match how am I supposed to</font>

597
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,039
correlate this information so it's an

598
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,229
industry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually moving</font>

599
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,710
in this direction we all have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

600
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,990
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start codifying what these</font>

601
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,450
things mean so we can actually get on

602
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:29,870
the same page because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

603
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:31,759
we're very far behind in I love this

604
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:38,080
slide because you have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what it</font>

605
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:40,639
is but it's impressive nonetheless

606
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,840
whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks bad this is</font>

607
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:50,740
actually the unique instances of malware

608
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:55,580
determined by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks at av-test so</font>

609
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:57,980
the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> information on antivirus</font>

610
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:03,470
software is that at best it only catches

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:06,980
fifty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new malware fifty</font>

612
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:11,059
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 120 million is well I'm no</font>

613
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,500
mathematician but that's a lot I mean

614
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:14,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks that looks like a tsunami</font>

615
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,899
coming that's just so if you're

616
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:19,970
depending on one antivirus product or

617
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:22,489
just one specific flavor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

618
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,370
you're screwed there's no way that you

619
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,620
can do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in fact if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you attended</font>

620
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,449
RSA this year at I think in all my years

621
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,518
of the industry I've never seen a more

622
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,129
consistent theme than attackers are

623
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,500
already inside your network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

624
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:38,120
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board everybody says saying</font>

625
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,009
the same thing and there's a simple

626
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,199
reason for that that's because it's true

627
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,669
you have to you have to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

628
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">been breached it's a sea change in</font>

629
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,629
thinking and in philosophy but it's a

630
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,408
necessary when i'll talk more about that

631
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:50,408
second chair

632
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:01,250
really wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had some kind of music to</font>

633
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,500
play during those transitions the

634
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,049
takeaway<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there is no silver bullet</font>

635
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,650
I'm not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Lone Ranger</font>

636
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:12,139
that's more the single solution to kill

637
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:14,500
to solve a single problem the werewolf

638
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:18,470
yep that's exactly where that comes from

639
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:21,200
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no silver bullet a layer</font>

640
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:24,740
technologies work best and you have to

641
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,750
assume that that a breach not even I

642
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,280
would say not even assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> up reach will</font>

643
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,390
occur you have to assume the breach has

644
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:35,350
already occurred that's why detection is

645
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:39,140
becoming more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more important</font>

646
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:43,730
especially think about 229 days inside

647
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:47,900
your network I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all</font>

648
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:50,179
about the importance of detection and

649
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,790
you know when we say signature bass it's

650
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:55,370
basically or when we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> silver bullet</font>

651
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:58,668
we mean a signature based approached<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

652
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">on one this this signature this block</font>

653
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:04,190
that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough that's</font>

654
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:08,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's just not I think it's been proven</font>

655
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:12,140
over and over to be ineffective so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

656
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,820
on the best practices again we do make

657
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,370
firewalls they don't like me sometimes

658
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot solely rely on traditional</font>

659
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,520
defensive perimeter security it's that

660
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is dead you have to remember</font>

661
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">your place in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

662
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,799
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be affected by external events I</font>

663
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,750
think the executives<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Sony have this</font>

664
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:38,000
tattooed now somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their bodies</font>

665
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:42,080
you have to assume a breach then now

666
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:48,169
what you've got to have a plan in place

667
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:50,480
for that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did art understand that all</font>

668
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,799
information and network assets are equal

669
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was talking a little bit earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

670
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:57,820
all the heartbleed heartbleed

<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> czar still able to be</font>

exploited

673
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,140
you know you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really prioritize</font>

674
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,330
budgets<font color="#E5E5E5"> are limited you have to figure</font>

675
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">out where you're going to spend to make</font>

676
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:12,030
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact and get the most bang</font>

677
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:15,870
for your buck sometimes that means you

678
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:19,820
know this stays insecure because it's

679
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">not important it doesn't matter yeah</font>

680
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,919
this is very huge security in response

681
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:29,010
has to be a continuous process things

682
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,750
change you know it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

683
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:34,080
new tech that introduces new folder

684
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,300
bullies it's also old tech to how many

685
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">times did we see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

686
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:43,110
nope you have to seek out credible and

687
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,480
reliable security intelligence you know

688
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:48,959
I think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> home depot several years</font>

689
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago you know they had it's it's the set</font>

690
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,620
it and forget it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think that</font>

691
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">works anymore at the especially I know</font>

692
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:59,610
target to how to add some issues with

693
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:01,559
with that up so you need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

694
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:04,439
constantly update your information you

695
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,309
constantly need to retest and retest and

696
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:14,070
retest security asked to be a process

697
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:17,250
what should I had a Snider put it it's

698
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:18,659
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a product it's a process actually a</font>

699
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,100
man<font color="#CCCCCC"> hem wants an ask him about that he</font>

said<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else said it but i still</font>

701
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:28,649
use home then I never talked to me all

702
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,990
right talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font>

703
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,980
a little bit just just curious what do

704
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,820
you guys think the most important

705
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:41,090
security story was<font color="#CCCCCC"> at last year sony</font>

706
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:45,540
anybody else I love security guys

707
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:46,949
anybody else just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious I'm only</font>

708
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,710
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can tell you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

709
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:56,670
wrong certain certain things actually

710
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">frightened me and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do i will</font>

711
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,030
admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread in the fear of knowing</font>

712
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:03,330
does anyone know what this is it's an

713
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,399
industrial blast furnace that<font color="#CCCCCC"> big thing</font>

714
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:09,360
so there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company in Germany last</font>

i call this a precursor of things to

that every device is now wired it's what

with security in mind this is this is

encryption when you're downloading

781
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:12,430
software updates so that's the scary

782
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,930
enough we did a follow-up study

783
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:18,919
specifically regarding home security

784
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:22,038
systems so if you have a home security

785
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,259
system well one hundred percent of the

786
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,440
ones we test it have privacy issues a

787
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:29,119
hundred percent had authorization issues

788
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:37,849
seventy percent used in secure cloud

789
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:39,799
storage again and fifty percent had in

791
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:48,650
minute things so that me my mind going

792
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:55,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">in different direction so really some of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">them you know by 2020 gardeners</font>

794
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:01,279
predicting there's going to be 26

795
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:04,368
billion units just of internet thing

796
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:07,759
devices wired devices so what does

797
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:11,089
actually cause and this is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

798
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:12,940
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's finding it's really caused</font>

799
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:18,109
the attack surface to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

800
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:20,660
exponentially explode will say so if the

801
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:23,598
past is any indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's going</font>

802
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a while before again like I said</font>

803
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,650
the introduction of new technology and

804
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:30,319
variably introduces security

805
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:35,170
vulnerabilities we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good</font>

806
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:35,170
handle on this at all yet that's a fact

807
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:42,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright let's talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the state</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

808
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:45,529
security operations more for a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

809
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:58,279
these are usually reside in data centers

810
00:37:45,529 --> 00:38:02,299
we did we did 118 assessments of 87

811
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:03,979
organizations in 18 countries so if you

812
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:06,469
have a security operation center you

813
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:10,098
would hope that you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

814
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:11,449
doing if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that level so we'll</font>

815
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:18,319
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look and see how certain</font>

816
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:19,880
industries are doing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that regard so</font>

817
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:21,589
the methodology we used with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

818
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,449

820
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:31,670
an integration in a nutshell a<font color="#E5E5E5"> key thing</font>

821
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:34,160
there is process that this is a applied

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:38,239
can be applied to any industry for a

823
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,359
sock it's all about a repeatability of

824
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">test detection capabilities and</font>

825
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,029
remediation capabilities so you can see

826
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:50,140
it goes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a level of zero and</font>

827
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:52,279
complete to level 5 which is optimized

828
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:56,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we tested a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of different</font>

industries<font color="#CCCCCC"> in these aspects</font>

830
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:13,829
okay okay um you know it's not really

00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good nobody even hit a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

832
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:17,559
government you probably wouldn't expect

833
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:20,130
it to very well telecom actually

834
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:24,640
surprised me that it was only a 1.1 to

835
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:27,700
the industry's we tested this is a lot

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it says even if you are up to</font>

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:33,460
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having a sock you might not</font>

838
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:35,049
be doing it that well retail is not

839
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,540
actually surprising considering all all

840
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:42,400
the point of cell phones that we've seen

841
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:45,779
recently a<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care um you know it</font>

842
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,630
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did i do it top 10 predictions</font>

844
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:53,890
and for medical data breaches i

00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:56,650
predicted it was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> average</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 30,000</font>

about a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> before i got my anthem</font>

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:09,910
waters had already hit that mark by like

851
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:12,640
februari financial institutions what

852
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,500
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think actually shows is security</font>

853
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,118
vulnerabilities in getting it right in

854
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:22,530
those problems affect everybody not just

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,530
one specific industry

856
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,700
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll roll these up into some of the</font>

857
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,340
key takeaways I hope somebody in here

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,330
sitting next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their boss I really do</font>

859
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:39,770
because now would be a good time to ask

860
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:42,620
for a raise at the number one concern I

861
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,870
said earlier the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the two biggest</font>

862
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,430
concerns one was I can't get my reports

863
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,870
degree I have to spend so much time

864
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,759
putting all this information together

865
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:53,299
why can't I just have one why can't you

866

guys get along<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apologize move on</font>

867
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,320

skilled resources man if you have good

869
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:03,200
people you better hold on to them

870
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:05,900
because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are hard to find dirty</font>

871
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,160
there's a I think I've written that a

the world but I think I've kind of just

898
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:19,670
gotten used to the fact that it's going

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:25,850
of the issues especially with socks and

901
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:28,790
I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also can be applied if</font>

902
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:32,210
you use a whole inference perhaps and

903
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:36,890
common sense you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once you implement</font>

like to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on lots of things so it's</font>

922
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:29,710
easy to remember you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like I was</font>

925
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,990
obviously we bought a lot more over the

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,870
years and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> early days we didn't</font>

always have a consistent focus and

928

vision I can admit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that was</font>

part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the turn but you know we've</font>

930
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:51,130
actually we've done fairly well now at

931
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,750
getting getting our vision together

932
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,690
we'll call it it's a better word choice

application research everything rolls up

943
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,400
under the HPS our umbrella a HP

enterprise security products block

945
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,820
that's where I do most of my writing I'm

946
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:36,400
probably one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our primary security</font>

00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,850
addressing this obviously that goes a

951
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:51,130
lot more in depth and has all the raw

952
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:53,740
data that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pull</font>

953
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,119
through and and see I think this year's

954
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:58,328
version was about 80 pages

955
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,640
there also is a 10 page summary that's
