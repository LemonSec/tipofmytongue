1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,300
um anybody got any stress any worries

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,199
anything anything yeah a few people okay

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,260
yeah me too right uh so that's why I

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,580
started this program

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,800
it's um you know

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,240
so many things have changed over the

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,279
last few years especially coming out of

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,200
covid um

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,660
we're kind of adjusting to The New

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,059
Normal whatever whatever normal is I'm

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,800
gonna I'm gonna challenge you to look at

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,420
normal in a different way

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,940
before I get off this stage

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,000
um

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,440
so like you said my program that I

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
developed is called remind

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,120
um for a couple of reasons

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,780
most of us know how to act properly when

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,520
everything is going fine

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,199
when we get emotional

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,760
things kind of go left a little bit

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,319
whereas my mom says you kind of lose

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,479
your home training when we get emotional

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,580
right so

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,260
reminds one you're going to change the

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,580
way you look at the world you're going

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,020
to change the way you think

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,540
but also just reminders when you get in

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,740
those moments

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,119
where you're not thinking straight when

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,560
you're emotional

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,280
um

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,420
to do

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,340
what's right

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,920
the goal of my program is peace of mind

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,579
that's it period end of story peace of

37
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,540
mind

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,759
okay so with that being said I only have

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,159
an hour and it takes a long time a lot

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,600
of my reminders and the forms of quotes

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,700
because quotes are the quickest way for

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,840
me

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,659
uh well reminders

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,399
right because like I said sometimes we

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,259
forget

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,479
so you guys all read that

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,259
all right good

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,520
the School of Life

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,259
my program is about life I don't know

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,540
much about what you guys do

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,060
um I did see the movie sneakers is it

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,439
kind of like that

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,840
you know okay

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,399
other than that I don't I don't really

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,420
know much

56
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,940
um not very computer savvy at all

57
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,420
but I'm here to teach you

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,679
my school of life

59
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,120
all right that's not supposed to be

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,739
there oh there we go all right

61
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,840
open-minded the mind is like a parachute

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
it doesn't work if it is not open so I

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,440
just want to encourage everybody to have

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,300
an open mind because we are going to I'm

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,920
going to challenge the way you think

66
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,660
who us

67
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,700
this is doing this right and we're are

68
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,500
responsible for our lives we understand

69
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,239
that right nobody's coming to save you

70
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,580
you're responsible for your life and if

71
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,440
you want to make changes you have to do

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
it

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,040
what it's a perspective ship now we're

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,900
going to change the way we look at life

75
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,040
right we're going to look through a

76
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,959
brand new lens

77
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,580
um so that we're not stressed as much

78
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,440
we're going to reevaluate our habitual

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,379
thinking and readjust our perspective

80
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,959
when we'll reset and restart right now

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,860
so all the re period words

82
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,980
is so that you trigger for me and for

83
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,780
you hopefully as well whenever you see

84
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,239
an Ari word it'll remind you

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,220
to remind yourself that you need to

86
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,780
think the right way all right come over

87
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,099
here and talk to you folks over here for

88
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,300
a while everybody on this side pretty

89
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
cool too yeah

90
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,319
we're right here right now so one of the

91
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,640
biggest components of this program is

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,099
everything happens right now in the

93
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,720
present moment right so if you're

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,540
worried to stress about something

95
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,739
it's usually about something that

96
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,540
happened in the past or something that's

97
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,400
going to happen in the future

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
or as I like to call nowhere

99
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,200
right because the past is nowhere but in

100
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
your mind the future is nowhere but in

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,580
your mind versus now here everything

102
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,379
happens in the present moment life is

103
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,620
just a string of Niles right everything

104
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,739
happens right now

105
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,840
why Stress and Anxiety at an all-time

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,819
high our current way of thinking is no

107
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,459
longer beneficial

108
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,159
the uh

109
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,959
the American medical journal one of

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,400
those medical institutions said that 70

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,540
of us

112
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,819
are taking prescription drugs for stress

113
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,040
or stress related illnesses 70 percent

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,660
and there's no number on how many people

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,759
are self-medicated

116
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,079
right that number is probably even

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,220
higher

118
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,259
so something's got to change something's

119
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,880
not working especially coming out of

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,620
code we got to kind of readjust

121
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,060
kind of figure out where we're going

122
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,680
with our lives because everything

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,160
changes

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
mindfulness

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
the practice of maintaining a complete

126
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
awareness of one's thoughts emotions or

127
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,840
experience

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,720
on

129
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,460
experiences I don't know why that's see

130
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,840
I told you guys I'm not I'm not good

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,580
with my computer experience is on a

132
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,259
moment to moment basically and that's

133
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,820
just the Webster dictionary I don't know

134
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,719
why that didn't line up right

135
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,639
that's perfect

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
Remember When

137
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,699
remember when back in the day remember

138
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,259
when we were kids and we had no no

139
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,419
issues remember we just had fun and you

140
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,440
just you just didn't really worry about

141
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,940
anything

142
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,440
when is an acronym that I actually

143
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,820
learned at the University of Notre Dame

144
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,860
from new Hope's who was my coach there

145
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,120
um

146
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,020
I'm gonna talk about him uh w i n stands

147
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,419
for what's important now

148
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,000
what's important now

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,979
remember you are what's important now I

150
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,300
would argue you are the most what's

151
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,400
important now in your life

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,720
because if you don't take care of you

153
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,919
there's nothing you can do for anybody

154
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,620
anybody else or any organization or any

155
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,360
company or anything you are the most

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,699
important person in your life take care

157
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,860
of you first

158
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,180
or you're not going to be effective in

159
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,520
trying to help somebody else all right

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,280
uh we have done the best that we have up

161
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,780
to this point but it's with the tools

162
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,780
that we have but it's time to retool

163
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,240
we're all flawed or Perfectly Imperfect

164
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,979
as I like to say

165
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,840
so be you to the fullest or as my

166
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,180
youngest daughter says beautifulest be

167
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,120
you to the fullest Beautiful List you

168
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,460
get that all right good so we're going

169
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,600
to retool

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,900
all right listen

171
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,580
we all got issues

172
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,860
right nobody's perfect I've been around

173
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,300
some of the most successful people in

174
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,400
the world athletes entrepreneurs

175
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,960
businessmen and women

176
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,000
we all got issues

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,940
all of us without a doubt so I would

178
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,280
challenge you to look at

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,740
imperfection as normal

180
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,380
right that we're all imperfect then that

181
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,360
sounds kind of normal to me right all

182
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,100
right so just want to get that out the

183
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,240
way to make sure that we're all on the

184
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,400
same page none of us are perfect and

185
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,758
that's okay

186
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,400
recall what makes you happy I know right

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,199
all right so

188
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,660
in your mind or even on your notepad I

189
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,800
want you to think about the three to

190
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
five things that are important in your

191
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,520
life all right just just make a note of

192
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
it three to five things that are most

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,900
important in your life

194
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,759
on that same list I want you to write

195
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,199
the three to five things that make you

196
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,759
happy

197
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,360
three to five things that make you happy

198
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,840
right

199
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,060
a lot of my program is based on a book

200
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,560
called The Course in Miracles I don't

201
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,139
know if anybody's ever heard of it um

202
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,419
the whole book is is is centered around

203
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,160
changing your perception or changing the

204
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,120
way you think

205
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,580
and of course in Miracles that's the

206
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,919
acim says the happiness is our only

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,000
function

208
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,500
happiness is our only function

209
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,900
uh yeah I don't know why that does that

210
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,580
nothing can harm you as much as your own

211
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,139
thoughts on guarded Buddha

212
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,379
all right so the first thing we're going

213
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,479
to do is be aware of what we're thinking

214
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,139
about

215
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,360
all right so recognize your thoughts a

216
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
lot of times

217
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,360
we just thinking we're just thinking we

218
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,620
don't know why we think what we think

219
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,199
and it makes us uh upset right so the

220
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,840
first step is awareness so we're going

221
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,099
to re-examine what you think about

222
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,379
there's another acronym weight w-a-i-t

223
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,400
weight

224
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,379
what am I thinking

225
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:15,240
what am I thinking all right because

226
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,860
here's what happens

227
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,500
if you're upset or if you're happy

228
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,379
it's because of whatever you're thinking

229
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,740
right your mind controls your emotions

230
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,940
so whatever you're thinking about is

231
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,199
going to control

232
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,020
the way you feel

233
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,399
so now we're going to reorganize and

234
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,760
re-prioritize our thoughts based on

235
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,620
what's important now

236
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,599
and what makes you happy

237
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,099
so everything that we think about not

238
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,659
everything that we do is going to focus

239
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,279
on only the things that are important to

240
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,120
us

241
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
and only things that make us happy

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,580
we get what we focus on so focus on what

243
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,880
we want not what we don't want

244
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,740
our tendency a lot of times is to focus

245
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,560
on the things that go bad

246
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,420
without even noticing all the things

247
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,100
that went great

248
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,480
on my way up here I thought I was gonna

249
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,519
I missed one flight in my entire life

250
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,779
and it was because

251
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,700
I had a layover and I thought my

252
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,700
connecting flight was at 111. but it was

253
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,320
at 11 11.

254
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,880
and I remember there was a lady walking

255
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,700
by and I I went to the food court and

256
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,380
she goes where are you going I was like

257
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,339
mind your business late in the morning

258
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,959
something to eat what's the problem but

259
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,640
she knew I was on the Atlanta flight so

260
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,140
I say all that to say

261
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,199
um

262
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,600
I got here safely and I got here on time

263
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,940
but the the uh

264
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,440
the parking garages at the Atlanta

265
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,940
airport and I've lived in Atlanta for 25

266
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,339
years both of them were closed and both

267
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,899
of them were full

268
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,339
so I'm driving around the airport for

269
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,620
about 40 minutes I'm sweating and I got

270
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,000
to remind myself and you'll understand

271
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
what I'm talking about a little bit

272
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,640
later

273
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,019
that what's going on is out of my

274
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:49,920
control

275
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,540
right we'll talk about that in a second

276
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,720
uh but just focus I say all that today I

277
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,940
got here safely I can tell you a million

278
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,500
things that went wrong

279
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,079
on the way here but I got here safely so

280
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:05,940
my choice is to focus on the good stuff

281
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,480
right

282
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:09,660
so like I said now we're going to

283
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,220
redirect all of our energy on what's

284
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,480
important now on what's happening let's

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,820
and release what's not what's important

286
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,019
happy all right here we go if you're

287
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,339
gonna you get offended and you gotta go

288
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:18,480
I understand

289
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,860
s a n g f

290
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,500
it's from a book New York Times

291
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
bestseller called the simple art of not

292
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
giving a

293
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,620
great book

294
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,200
there's a method in there

295
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
called the not sorry method that he

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,740
talks about that I love

297
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,079
he said decide what it is

298
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,300
you don't give a about

299
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,040
and then don't give a about those

300
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
things

301
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,000
that's pretty simple right

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,579
decide what you care about

303
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,440
and if you don't care about it don't

304
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
spend any time on it

305
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,980
not rocket science

306
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,260
right a lot of us

307
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,839
most of us are ambitious

308
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,820
and want to be someplace other than

309
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,839
where we are right now we have

310
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,339
aspirations we want to go someplace

311
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,380
different if you are not where you want

312
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,640
to be in life and you want to get to

313
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,980
another place a higher level

314
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,500
you have to focus on only the things

315
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,180
that are important to you

316
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,279
we spend so much time focusing on things

317
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,899
that don't matter

318
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,940
big picture will not help us move

319
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,980
forward in life

320
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,260
so what are we doing

321
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,180
right what do you care about

322
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,920
if you don't care about it why are you

323
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,600
spending time on it

324
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,579
this time of year I can watch

325
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,040
SportsCenter I record it I can watch it

326
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,140
in about 10 minutes

327
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,800
not a hockey fan not a baseball fan

328
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,320
not a soccer fan not a tennis fan

329
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,000
there's nothing for me to watch on

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,380
SportsCenter except football stuff

331
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,959
that's coming up in the NBA finals

332
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,339
I don't care about it so I don't spend

333
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,680
any time watching it real simple right

334
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,240
not rocket science

335
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,560
so now we're going to refocus on our

336
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,240
journey now

337
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,860
not our destination this is very

338
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,240
important because a lot of times we get

339
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,220
caught up

340
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,200
and get to where we want to be for me as

341
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,339
an athlete

342
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,440
we want to win a Super Bowl right that's

343
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,300
that's the goal from being a from being

344
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,519
a toddler wherever we pick up uh picked

345
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,139
up a football the goal was to win a

346
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,440
Super Bowl

347
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,779
I lost sight of that sometimes

348
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,760
right I lost sight of the Germany

349
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,500
because I was so focused on just getting

350
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,180
to the Super Bowl but you have to go

351
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,860
through training camp you have to be six

352
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,200
well now 17 regular season games

353
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,720
in the playoffs to get there the journey

354
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,459
is incredible

355
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,800
the journey is incredible focus on your

356
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,639
journey

357
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,220
now the day-to-day

358
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,680
to help you get to wherever you want to

359
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,099
be in life

360
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,220
oh shoot I forgot that last uh

361
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,860
that's so cool right we are shaped and

362
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,899
by our thoughts we become what we think

363
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,139
and that's promoted they're going to

364
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,220
just quotes all throughout here because

365
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,360
the quotes are the way that I remind

366
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,519
myself as well this this might be more

367
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,040
for me than it is for you because I was

368
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,100
I was at a point in my life where

369
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,959
I was stressed and I didn't know what to

370
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,100
do

371
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,660
and I couldn't get out of my own way and

372
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,120
I had to figure it out right like I like

373
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,860
the first slide said you're responsible

374
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,540
for your life nobody's coming to save

375
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,320
you

376
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,880
nobody's coming to save you

377
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,220
unfortunately or fortunately it's

378
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,560
actually a very good place to be

379
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,899
my mind this was initially called Mom

380
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,240
your business without telling it down a

381
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,560
little bit there are three types of

382
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,899
business mine yours and gods that's by

383
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,339
Byron Katie so I'm going to encourage

384
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,500
you to focus on your business only

385
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,380
all right mind your business

386
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,839
and that's it pretty simple

387
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,519
remind ourselves that we are going to

388
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,199
focus on our business only because we do

389
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,000
not know what is best for everyone else

390
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,560
sometimes not even ourselves

391
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,360
let me say that again sometimes we don't

392
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,740
know what's best for ourselves how many

393
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,079
times we made decisions in our lives and

394
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,279
we thought it was the best thing that

395
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,779
could have happened to us

396
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,839
anybody been divorced

397
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,480
anybody been in a bad relationship

398
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,620
anybody been in a job they didn't want

399
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,420
and you thought that was the best thing

400
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,000
that you that could ever happen to you

401
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
sometimes we don't know so if I don't

402
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,420
know what's best for me how do I know

403
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,940
what's best for you

404
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,440
does that make any sense does that make

405
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,699
sense if I don't know what's best for me

406
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,019
sometimes

407
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,519
how do I know what's best I want to let

408
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,720
you figure out your own life and I'm

409
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,220
gonna figure out mine

410
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,079
deal deal all right

411
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,040
well remind to work the only person who

412
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,480
has to change is you

413
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,120
the only person who has to change is the

414
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,100
person in the mirror

415
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,839
our happiness will no longer depend on

416
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,540
someone or something being other

417
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,459
than it actually is

418
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,459
remind us also

419
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,800
a program about acceptance and we'll

420
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,940
talk about that a little bit more just

421
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,139
accepting life the way it is

422
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,100
remember we no longer have to change or

423
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,220
fix anyone or anything except ourselves

424
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,899
the next one is going to be a doozy I

425
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,639
hope don't anybody pass out here all

426
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,959
right

427
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,480
release the urge to get unsolicited

428
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,720
advice

429
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,579
right

430
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,519
once I mastered this part of my program

431
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,660
I didn't know what to say in

432
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,200
conversations anymore

433
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,199
[Laughter]

434
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,699
right because I'm always we're always

435
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,620
trying to fix things right somebody tell

436
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,579
you something while you go well you

437
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,660
should have did this or if I were you

438
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,220
I'd have done this or maybe you should

439
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,360
do this

440
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,339
most of us don't follow the advice that

441
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,660
we ask for

442
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,579
we're not going to follow advice that we

443
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,980
didn't ask for

444
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,779
the main reason we don't follow it is

445
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,060
because a lot of times it sounds like

446
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,279
criticism

447
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,339
right if you say somebody if you if you

448
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,959
say to somebody hey man maybe this is my

449
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,100
this is this is one of my good friends

450
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,480
over here jafira young I've known him

451
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,459
since we were nine years old he actually

452
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,779
introduced me to Jake and he's the

453
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,600
reason why I'm here ultimately

454
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,639
right um

455
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,980
what was I saying I got all caught up in

456
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,360
your in my boy over here what was I

457
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,500
talking about

458
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,399
you don't know either

459
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,220
advice right so if I said jafir

460
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,980
um maybe you should eat a salad or two

461
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,660
what are you going to hear

462
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,980
I'm overweight

463
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,959
right

464
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
here

465
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,180
so don't give advice

466
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,100
don't get advice that people don't ask

467
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,880
for

468
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,980
very simple all right this is going to

469
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,300
save you time to focus on what's

470
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,699
important now and focus on what makes

471
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,120
you happy

472
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,720
relinquish control and accept things we

473
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,699
cannot control

474
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,040
anybody live in an area

475
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,079
there's really bad traffic

476
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,300
show hands anybody

477
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,160
all right good

478
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,920
I live in Atlanta and traffic is bad a

479
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,000
lot

480
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,980
and it seems like for no apparent reason

481
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,899
a lot of times

482
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,279
um

483
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,259
there is the Dome downtown though the

484
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,120
Braves play there there's a professional

485
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,339
hockey team so if you're not abreast of

486
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,900
the schedule Georgia Tech is there in my

487
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,339
alma mater as well

488
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,199
there's always going to be traffic

489
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,020
right so

490
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,939
cannot control traffic

491
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,819
I can't I wish I could I wish I had a

492
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,559
car that turned into a helicopter so

493
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,059
whenever I got stuck in traffic I could

494
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,140
just disappear

495
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,299
right

496
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,980
I can't control the traffic so I've

497
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,360
accepted the fact that I can't

498
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,340
right because another you're sitting

499
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,559
there in the past I've sat in traffic

500
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,539
and I'm pissed off because nobody the

501
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,120
traffic is not moving ha here's one how

502
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
many people know how everybody else

503
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
should drive

504
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,760
right I know how everybody else I

505
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,080
thought I did

506
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,480
and I have to remind myself that I don't

507
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,820
know what everybody should drive because

508
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,740
here's the reality of it

509
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,980
some people drive too slow my mom says I

510
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,539
drive too fast

511
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,760
a lot of people are distracted right

512
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,840
they're on their phones they're talking

513
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,980
they're doing something other than

514
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,780
paying attention to the road

515
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,200
you don't know if people have been in

516
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,520
car accidents

517
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,900
you don't know people have lost people

518
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,419
in car accidents you don't know why

519
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,640
people are driving the way they drive

520
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,220
you have no idea

521
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,820
so with that understanding you accept

522
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,179
and I'll get to that part in a second uh

523
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,860
you accept that you can't control the

524
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,780
way people drive

525
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,340
you know I want I don't know who gives

526
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,440
out licenses anymore but I would like to

527
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,480
talk to that person

528
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,900
because all right I can't get you

529
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,220
so we're gonna let go of things we can't

530
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,600
control

531
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,120
traffic is the easiest easy the easiest

532
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,860
example because all of us have been

533
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,360
stranded in traffic at some point in

534
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,140
time

535
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,660
you know when people drive the worst in

536
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,520
my opinion

537
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,100
when it's raining yes but when I'm in a

538
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,280
hurry

539
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,679
that's when people drop when I couldn't

540
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,620
find a parking spot at the airport

541
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,900
yesterday I was like Doris calm down

542
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,720
come it's like it's you it's me it's not

543
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,760
these other people around you I'm late

544
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,740
I'm afraid I'm gonna miss my flight

545
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,900
so now I'm like hey

546
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,940
in my mind I'm not screaming right I'm

547
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,820
like come on man I got some place to go

548
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,500
everything worked out though because my

549
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,080
flight actually got delayed and I walked

550
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,120
I got to the airport and I don't like

551
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,440
waiting in the airport so it worked out

552
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,700
perfectly because I walked straight on

553
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,720
the plane

554
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
I got off the off the train and walked

555
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,200
and there was no that there was no

556
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,460
waiting I got on the plane we left in

557
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,020
like 10 minutes

558
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,039
I almost missed it though

559
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
all right

560
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,220
mind altering

561
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,720
you cannot change the way you feel until

562
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,860
you change the way you think because

563
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,539
your thoughts will determine how you

564
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,580
feel Tony Robbins I mentioned that

565
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,720
earlier

566
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,340
remind ourselves that everything without

567
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,020
exception changes

568
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,580
not only is change possible it's

569
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,740
inevitable life is subject to change

570
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,140
sometimes instantaneously usually it

571
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,620
takes time

572
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,220
Everything Changes

573
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,559
nothing stays the same

574
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,360
ever

575
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,039
I know we like things to be comfortable

576
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,720
and familiar

577
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,059
and feel secure

578
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,280
Everything Changes

579
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,900
from the day you're born to the day you

580
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,419
die nothing stays the same

581
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,220
so I want you guys to just just

582
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,600
understand that and accept it um

583
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,280
some changes happen

584
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,480
something could happen and your whole

585
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,460
life could change if you have kids I

586
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,900
tell people all the time when you have

587
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,880
your first kid your life's going to be

588
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,460
different from here forever

589
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,260
Everything Changes once you have a kid

590
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,120
your life is not going to be the same

591
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,500
right there's going to be events in your

592
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,299
lives that we have

593
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,020
um

594
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,580
things things are going to change they

595
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,659
just they're not you're going to change

596
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:55,919
jobs you're going to change spouses

597
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,059
you're going to change

598
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,980
your address

599
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,659
and that's okay this is called the

600
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,620
school of life I'm not telling you

601
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,360
anything you should know already

602
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,740
right but a lot of times what happens is

603
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,880
once we get emotional when we get

604
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,100
worried or we get upset we forget how

605
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,299
life works

606
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,460
this is just how life works I'm not this

607
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,620
I shouldn't be this is not

608
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,820
I'm not telling you anything you

609
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,440
shouldn't already know is what I'm

610
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,740
saying

611
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,179
recall change starts with our habits the

612
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,419
2190 rule so

613
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,539
to change your habits it takes 21 days

614
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:30,600
to change or to form a habit 90 days to

615
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,460
make it a lifestyle your life is going

616
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,500
to go in the direction of your habits

617
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,299
it's what you do every day will

618
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,059
determine how successful you are long

619
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:39,960
term

620
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,240
as a professional athlete during the off

621
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,080
season

622
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,900
I hired a world-renowned track coach and

623
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,600
a bodybuilder as my trainers

624
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,220
the average career in the NFL is less

625
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,460
than three years about 2.7 years

626
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,720
that's it

627
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
my habits kept me along around longer

628
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,620
than I should have

629
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,299
I had guys that I would invite to come

630
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,740
work out with me in Atlanta and in

631
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,240
Atlanta and summertime right now my God

632
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,039
it's hot it's like it's

633
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,840
um but we used to train it six o'clock

634
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,280
in the morning it was still like 90

635
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,440
degrees but there were so many guys who

636
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,059
would come

637
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,700
and we'd work out and they would leave

638
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,080
and they would call me later and go

639
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,059
you're absolutely out of your mind

640
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,640
why are you working that hard

641
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,900
I'm like hey dude I don't know if you

642
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,000
noticed but there's a draft every year

643
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,039
somebody's coming to get your job every

644
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,620
year and

645
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,320
you the the your the career span is less

646
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,640
than three years

647
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,460
why wouldn't you do I'm like listen I

648
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,500
prayed about this I've I've dreamed

649
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,780
about this I've worked my tail off my

650
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,340
entire life why would I get there and

651
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,539
then just rest

652
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,940
that doesn't make any sense to me right

653
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,340
your habits your daily habits what you

654
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,840
do every day will determine how your

655
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,280
life goes all right

656
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,960
change is the only constant in life

657
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,460
remember that we controlled our thoughts

658
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,100
and we can change our minds

659
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,559
think about how you got here

660
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,179
think about what your hotel room looks

661
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,620
like

662
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,879
think about your schedule today

663
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,620
I say all that to only say one thing you

664
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,679
control what you think about

665
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,780
you control what you think about now

666
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,940
sometimes what happens is we start to

667
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,559
worry and these crazy thoughts come out

668
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,600
out of nowhere right

669
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,860
um

670
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,480
and the goal is not to avoid those

671
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,380
thoughts because those thoughts are

672
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,400
going to come I don't know where they

673
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,900
come well a lot of them come from your

674
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,980
subconscious mind but that's a whole

675
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,400
other talk

676
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,620
when those thoughts come in the fearful

677
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,940
thoughts the thoughts of worry the

678
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,720
thoughts that you're not going to

679
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,820
accomplish what you want to accomplish

680
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,679
the goal is to replace that thought with

681
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,000
another thought

682
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,919
those thoughts are going to come I've

683
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,659
tried to stop them trust me they just

684
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:46,740
keep coming I don't know where they come

685
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,960
from like I said I do but that's another

686
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,520
conversation

687
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,580
you control your thoughts

688
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,840
so now we're going to rearrange our

689
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,640
habitual thinking and release any

690
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,020
negative thought patterns

691
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,580
here's just a couple of quotes like I

692
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,620
said most it's called remind because

693
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,580
um

694
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,140
I go to quotes

695
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,279
because I usually can't go through my

696
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,720
whole program although I know it by

697
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,620
heart

698
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,580
um

699
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,440
so I just I I just have a little quote

700
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,159
size reminders

701
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,059
all right here's a big one things that

702
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,679
you previously believe or evidence of

703
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,120
bad luck will now be views that will

704
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,620
help you move forward toward greatness

705
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,600
that's and Dyer

706
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
recognize we have selective perspectives

707
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,679
and our only problem in life is the way

708
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,419
we look at it

709
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,799
we're going to reframe the way we look

710
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,779
at life so think about

711
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:39,120
this projector right here

712
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,919
imagine

713
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,720
there's like a dark spot over here in

714
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,860
the corner

715
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,779
and I come off here and I and I get up

716
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,520
there and I try to wipe it off

717
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,039
and I can't get it off

718
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,559
right and this this this screen

719
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,200
represents life

720
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,900
you the individual are the projector

721
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,880
if there's something wrong with the way

722
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
life looks

723
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,240
it's because that little black spot

724
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,340
that's on the screen is not on the

725
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,279
screen it's on the projector

726
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,260
so the way you look at life is going to

727
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,260
determine what you see here

728
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,760
does that make sense

729
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,880
all right so like I said too

730
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,500
the goal is peace of mind but also

731
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,820
change your perspective on life

732
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,279
uh oh no I'm sorry I should have gone

733
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,799
back uh

734
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,559
cops are here to help us evolve mistakes

735
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,900
too so

736
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,539
a lot of times we kind of get dragged

737
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,179
down when we have challenges so cops

738
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,200
is challenges obstacles and problems

739
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,260
challenges obstacles and problems

740
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,179
that's how we grow in life

741
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,159
that's how we evolve think back to when

742
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,760
you were a kid

743
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,480
right you make mistakes and that's how

744
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,460
you learn

745
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,679
do you think toddlers when they learn

746
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,020
how to walk

747
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,460
they just give up because they keep

748
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,900
falling

749
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,020
no they figure out how to make it work

750
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,760
right it's the same thing here it's just

751
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,840
a challenge

752
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,480
if it doesn't work

753
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,059
try another way

754
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,620
also

755
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,960
show of hands who doesn't have

756
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,299
any cops who has no challenges no

757
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,940
obstacles no problems show hands

758
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,059
thank you it's normal it is absolutely

759
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,700
normal this is the way life works I

760
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,620
don't know who told us differently

761
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,419
or why we believe that life's going to

762
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,039
be easy and they're not going to be

763
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,620
doesn't work like that

764
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,059
they're going to be challenges and you

765
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,559
can overcome all of them if you're here

766
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,760
today you've overcome most of your

767
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,440
problems

768
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,700
would you agree

769
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,500
all right good

770
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,279
um

771
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,760
and mistakes Life Is trial and error

772
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,039
that's how we learn that's how we that's

773
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,020
how we grow and that's how we evolve so

774
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,120
when these so when you make mistakes

775
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,980
or when you come across these challenges

776
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,600
or obstacles or problems

777
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,340
say oh yeah that old football player

778
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,720
reminded me that that's the way it goes

779
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,480
this is not abnormal this is not crazy

780
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,279
this is the way life works

781
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,539
realize life is our classroom and

782
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:16,320
everyone and everything are teachers

783
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,700
so now we're going to reinterpret what

784
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,440
we see and reconsider

785
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,520
what we believe

786
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,440
maybe story you know um I've read the

787
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,460
story somewhere and then I heard

788
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,679
anybody's watch The Man in the man in

789
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,840
the arena the Tom Brady story

790
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,299
no all right well he he he read the

791
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,799
story as well

792
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,980
and uh and related on the uh on the

793
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,740
program so the story goes there's a

794
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,120
there's a guy who lives in a village

795
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,480
let's say early 1900s

796
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,559
um

797
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,779
very modest guy you know he lives with

798
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,140
his son and they have a horse

799
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,179
one day the horse takes off and they

800
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,559
can't find the horse

801
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,539
and his neighbor goes oh my God that's

802
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:58,799
what are you going to do like that's the

803
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,880
worst thing that could happen to you you

804
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,559
don't have a horse now

805
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,360
and the guy goes

806
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,100
Maybe

807
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,720
a week later the horse comes back with

808
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,220
10 other horses

809
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,440
now the guy has 11 horses his neighbor

810
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,960
goes oh my God that's incredible you

811
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,700
have 11 horses like you have more horses

812
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,740
than anybody ever

813
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,500
that is awesome the guy goes

814
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,039
Maybe

815
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,760
his son is trying to break one of the

816
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,760
horses in falls off the horse breaks his

817
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,140
arm

818
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,779
the neighbor nosy neighbor right

819
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,980
neighbor's like hey oh my God that's

820
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,020
awful you know he broke his arm what are

821
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,360
you gonna do

822
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,700
he goes maybe

823
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,279
a week later a war starts and there's a

824
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,260
draft to come in door to door to get all

825
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,820
the healthy young men to go fight a war

826
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,919
guess who can't go

827
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,620
his son because he has a broken arm

828
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,779
moral of the story is

829
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,520
when you go through challenges obstacles

830
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,679
are problems in that moment

831
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,600
they may seem like the worst thing that

832
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,460
could happen to you

833
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,380
but actually might help you out down the

834
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,520
road

835
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,960
I don't know if there's any people I'm

836
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,340
not an overly religious person but I

837
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,600
pray a lot and I meditate a lot

838
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,440
I have to remind myself when I pray

839
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,760
to accept whatever comes

840
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,720
right because a lot of times we pray and

841
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,520
go away God that's not what I asked for

842
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,679
that's not that you're looking at that's

843
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,539
not what I asked for

844
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,860
point point in time

845
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,799
I was in so I went to Notre Dame for two

846
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,659
years I transfer ended up at Georgia

847
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,179
Tech and

848
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,039
my junior year they moved me to wide

849
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:38,940
receiver

850
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,580
I played running back my entire life

851
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,699
um

852
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,320
and so I thought that my NFL dream was

853
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,100
over

854
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,799
I actually literally buckled down in

855
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,659
school I graduated from Georgia Tech

856
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,799
with a degree in business management

857
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
before I got drafted because I thought I

858
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,679
wasn't going to get drafted

859
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,620
the year I played wide receiver like I

860
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,200
said I was like it's over

861
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,299
fast forward

862
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,860
to being drafted by the Green Bay

863
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,539
Packers

864
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:13,100
whom I didn't want to be drafted by

865
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,480
my agent says to me before it's wrapped

866
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,520
he's like where do you want to go

867
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,840
I was like you know I'd like to go to

868
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,340
the Giants because I'm from Syracuse New

869
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,840
York it's a short drive I can see all my

870
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,700
family and friends all the time I was

871
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,840
like but I don't care as long as I'll

872
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,100
end up someplace like Green Bay

873
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,120
it worked out right but I say I was one

874
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,980
of the best pass catching uh running

875
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,080
backs in the NFL while I played so that

876
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,340
year when I played wide receiver

877
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,440
actually helped me out it was a blessing

878
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
in disguise it was something that I

879
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,080
prayed for but just didn't it didn't

880
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,520
look the way I thought it was going to

881
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,140
look

882
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,299
so just be mindful of that

883
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,679
you know when things seem like they're

884
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,760
going left

885
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,100
it may just be it may be a detour to put

886
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,879
you on the right Road

887
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,799
by changing his mind he has changed the

888
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,539
most powerful device that was ever given

889
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,980
to him for change that's also A Course

890
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,019
in Miracles

891
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:05,279
so I go through a couple of these I'm

892
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,480
gonna grab some water

893
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,679
I'll click through these

894
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,240
let me know when you got it

895
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,779
you got it

896
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,279
mind-blowing uh watch what happens when

897
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,779
you don't Name an experience that's bad

898
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,519
instead bring an inner acceptance and

899
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,100
enter yes to it and so let it be as it

900
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,260
is Eckhart Tolle

901
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,000
it's got a bunch of great books uh The

902
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,500
Power of Now

903
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,019
and my favorite book is his A New Earth

904
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:48,299
is really it talks about the current the

905
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,559
present moment and changing your

906
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,700
perspective

907
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,440
uh remind ourselves that we live in the

908
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,700
world of Duality meaning

909
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,919
one thing depends on the other you can't

910
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,899
have short without tall can have big

911
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,700
without small can't have light without

912
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,960
dark

913
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,260
everything we live in a world of duality

914
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,000
recall everything seems to have a

915
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,580
purpose in some point in time even the

916
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,500
things that we perceive as wrong or bad

917
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,000
there seems to be a time for everything

918
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,059
right and I think the uh the thing that

919
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,440
comes to mind because death is probably

920
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,640
the one thing that's that's high on

921
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,080
everybody's list of things that we worry

922
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,000
about or fear

923
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,679
um

924
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,240
there's a movie about it Samuel L

925
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,799
Jackson played back in the day A Time to

926
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,940
Kill

927
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,500
you guys remember that

928
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,940
I think killing is one of the worst

929
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,620
things we can do I honestly believe it's

930
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,080
not our jobs as human beings to

931
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,000
determine when somebody or something

932
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,440
lives or dies

933
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,960
that's just my personal opinion I don't

934
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,880
even kill bugs

935
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,580
I don't I have

936
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,679
we call I've called it a bug relocation

937
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,720
kit

938
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,940
get a pla get a paper cup get an

939
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,940
envelope pick it up and let the thing go

940
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,500
outside

941
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,500
so my son is seven years old he goes

942
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,000
why don't you just step on it Dad

943
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,419
I said what if you were trying to go

944
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,039
home to your parents and somebody just

945
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,419
stepped on me

946
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,940
and you never made it home

947
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,799
you just I

948
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,440
that spider might have a family he may

949
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,299
be going home to see his kids you didn't

950
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,960
see Charlotte's Web

951
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,899
right so the sidebar I just um

952
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,460
there is a time to kill and I know I

953
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,559
know some of you especially uh you women

954
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,059
if you see of spiders like you know what

955
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,500
it's A Time to Kill

956
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,399
this thing is good

957
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,480
uh but I just say all that to say

958
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,100
they're they're even even the things

959
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,919
that seem bad in our in our lives

960
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,480
they're there apparently is a time for

961
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,240
it there's as much as I despise War

962
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,740
I don't our history is littered with

963
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,080
Wars everywhere around the world even

964
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,120
right as I speak now there's a war going

965
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,519
on right I just don't I think there's a

966
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,799
better way to solve your problems than

967
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,399
killing each other

968
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,919
uh evil is necessary because without it

969
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,599
free will was impossible without free

970
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,339
will there could be no growth no forward

971
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,659
movement and that's a book called the

972
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,980
proof of heaven

973
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,899
remember we control like inner dialogue

974
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,599
or the stories we tell ourselves this is

975
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,399
this is a this is a big it was this is a

976
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,079
big one for me

977
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,339
um

978
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:24,960
we talked about earlier about how we

979
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,000
control that inner dialogue right

980
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,500
we have to be careful with our inner

981
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,119
dialogue because sometimes we believe

982
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,219
what we tell ourselves even though it

983
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,440
may not be true

984
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,500
for those of you who have kids

985
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,000
and I've ever tried to get in touch with

986
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,379
your kid

987
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,418
and couldn't

988
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,399
and you start to worry

989
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,239
I have a very creative imagination

990
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,280
and

991
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,139
I can think of the worst possible thing

992
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,699
that could happen

993
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,339
or I would imagine the worst possible

994
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:57,599
thing when I couldn't get in touch with

995
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,160
my daughter's 20 years old now but when

996
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,740
she was a teenager

997
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,900
teenage girls just blow you off

998
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,640
they will they'll just sit they'll just

999
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,900
laying out whatever

1000
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,640
and now I'm worried thinking somebody's

1001
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,599
kidnapped they're throwing in the back

1002
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,660
of a truck and she's heading down 95.

1003
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,000
is that true absolutely not but I'm

1004
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,420
worried about it so you have to be very

1005
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,980
mindful of what you tell yourself

1006
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,300
especially when you're when you're

1007
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,160
worrying about things

1008
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,200
right that may not be true

1009
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
I've

1010
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,680
if you have kids

1011
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,359
you know what I'm talking about

1012
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,859
you know how that goes so just be

1013
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,599
mindful of the stories you tell

1014
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,800
yourselves

1015
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,859
um because they will drive you crazy

1016
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:39,300
remember the fact check what we tell

1017
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,280
ourselves fear is an acronym for false

1018
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,859
evidence appearing real

1019
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:47,160
false evidence appearing real

1020
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,619
right because when we're worried

1021
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:50,760
we're just scared something's gonna

1022
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,980
happen that we don't want to happen

1023
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,619
sometimes with no proof

1024
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,960
or evidence that what we fear is on its

1025
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,099
way

1026
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,079
so be mindful of what you think about be

1027
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,640
mindful of what you tell your inner

1028
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,119
dialogue determines Who You Are

1029
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,320
if you believe you're going to be

1030
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,700
successful you're going to be great

1031
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,579
that's the road you're on but if you but

1032
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:12,900
if you also believe you're going to be a

1033
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,240
failure and you're not going to make it

1034
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,920
that's also the road you're going to be

1035
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,040
on

1036
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,480
all right your mind your life goes where

1037
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,400
your mind takes you and if you don't

1038
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,599
believe in yourself you're never going

1039
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,920
to make it

1040
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,540
you have to believe in yourself but you

1041
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,680
have to be careful of what you tell

1042
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,520
yourself

1043
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,160
don't don't put yourselves down I've

1044
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,260
been

1045
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,940
I had a lot of injuries when I played so

1046
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,140
there were a lot of

1047
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,240
you know like like negative inner like

1048
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,240
negative stuff in the in the paper about

1049
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,940
me being uh injury prone

1050
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,859
and

1051
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,480
the fact was I did have a lot of

1052
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,980
injuries but if but if you let that

1053
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,020
stuff get to you

1054
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,460
I never would have I never would have

1055
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,020
come back from injuries

1056
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,460
you know what I mean so just be careful

1057
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,800
what you tell yourself and believe in

1058
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,920
yourself

1059
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,880
begin to see wholeness rather than good

1060
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,980
or bad fortune um

1061
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,540
and that goes back to the story I told

1062
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,900
you before

1063
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,599
when things seem like they're bad

1064
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,940
they may not be bad in that moment it

1065
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,920
may seem like it back but it even if it

1066
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,420
is just embrace it and accept what

1067
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,680
whatever comes your way because that's

1068
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,480
the world we live in you know we I

1069
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,740
didn't talk about it maybe it's coming

1070
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,740
up next about just total acceptance

1071
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,780
here's yin and yang this is one of my

1072
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,760
favorite symbols

1073
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,720
and here's life

1074
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,160
mind-blowing the thoughts I am thinking

1075
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,079
right now are making me unhappy Course

1076
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,400
in Miracles

1077
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,599
so now we're going to redirect our

1078
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,820
thoughts and acknowledge and embrace and

1079
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,320
name what you're thinking about release

1080
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,820
that thought and replace it with a

1081
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,140
different thought

1082
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,339
all right so whenever you're feeling

1083
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,560
something whenever you're feeling

1084
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,740
angry acknowledge it and embrace it

1085
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,780
I'm mad but then you have that inner

1086
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,300
dialogue with yourself why am I mad

1087
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,160
can I change what I'm mad about can I

1088
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,960
control what I'm mad about

1089
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,760
right

1090
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,040
whenever you have

1091
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,140
the negative thoughts

1092
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,240
you have to immediately replace it with

1093
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,099
something different

1094
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,260
uh

1095
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,119
here's the f word again

1096
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,339
replace what the f with there are

1097
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,920
this happens to me when I'm driving

1098
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,740
I'll say hell instead of saying f

1099
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,020
who the hell drives like that

1100
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,119
where the hell are you going

1101
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,339
who the hell gave you a driver's license

1102
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:41,220
why are you driving like that

1103
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,440
when I asked myself those questions the

1104
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,240
answer is there are people who drive

1105
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,200
slow

1106
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,300
there are people who can't drive

1107
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,220
they're people who drive

1108
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,800
like they don't like they're in NASCAR

1109
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,240
so whenever you think something

1110
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,619
shouldn't be happening

1111
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,339
replace WTF with their r

1112
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,920
there are this is the world we live in

1113
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,480
not everybody's going to drive the way

1114
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,800
you want them to drive not everybody's

1115
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,440
going to talk or dress or look or act or

1116
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,480
think the way you want them to think and

1117
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,740
that's okay

1118
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,220
you know we live in a time now where

1119
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,140
we think because you disagree with

1120
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,000
somebody or you disagree with the way

1121
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,859
they think

1122
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,960
that person's a bad person that person's

1123
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,640
an enemy and we'll talk about that

1124
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,040
coming up here um

1125
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,020
at least not liking people and replace

1126
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,880
it with not liking the way a person

1127
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,480
thinks enemies versus idiots

1128
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,400
I'd rather be around a bunch of idiots

1129
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,500
than a bunch of enemies

1130
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,079
but that's the way you look at it right

1131
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,400
just because somebody thinks differently

1132
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,980
than the way you think

1133
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,500
doesn't make them your enemy they just

1134
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,640
think differently than you think and

1135
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,140
that's fine we all can think the way we

1136
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,119
want to think

1137
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,260
right so we're uh

1138
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,400
man these devices

1139
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,420
I'm going to say something that might

1140
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,500
not be problem I'm gonna talk about

1141
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,960
something that may not be popular but

1142
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,339
um

1143
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:03,780
and you may not agree with me and I

1144
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,579
don't care

1145
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,220
because I can't control what you think

1146
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,200
the gun laws

1147
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,200
right some people think that

1148
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,819
you have a right to have a gun the

1149
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:17,339
Second Amendment right and some people

1150
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:18,660
think

1151
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,400
that I don't want everybody in the world

1152
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,839
to have a gun because people are going

1153
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,420
crazy with these guns

1154
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,500
right

1155
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,940
so

1156
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,940
second amendment was ratified

1157
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,579
so we can protect ourselves

1158
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,500
against the government if something went

1159
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,520
wrong

1160
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,660
does that sound right to y'all

1161
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,440
all right so

1162
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,140
today in 2022

1163
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,880
if the government has an uprising and

1164
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,500
you want to do something about it what

1165
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,960
are your little guns gonna do

1166
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,040
they got drones

1167
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,940
what are you going to do

1168
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:59,119
what

1169
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,460
am I seeing you praying right now uh

1170
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,480
what does that mean

1171
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,859
I'm talking about guns here in the

1172
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,279
United States

1173
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,640
we don't have what

1174
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,839
I can't understand you you take that

1175
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,500
down for a second

1176
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,420
right no and and I get your point I get

1177
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,319
your point

1178
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,000
but I'm just saying that if we as

1179
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,440
Citizens try to rise up against our

1180
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,579
government

1181
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,920
I don't think we have a chance

1182
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,660
but that's just my opinion like I said

1183
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,460
if you want guns

1184
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,220
keep your guns if you feel safe do

1185
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,800
whatever you need to do I worry about my

1186
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,540
kids

1187
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,339
that's all I just don't want somebody

1188
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:54,780
who doesn't have mindfulness training to

1189
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,339
have a bad day

1190
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,440
and decide

1191
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,000
to do whatever it is they're going to do

1192
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,680
all right we just got too serious let's

1193
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,359
keep it light

1194
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,400
going against the present uh going

1195
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,780
against the president is a misuse of

1196
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,980
time wishing and waiting for something

1197
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,660
better to happen we distract ourselves

1198
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,700
with what's not there and that's of

1199
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,920
Course in Miracles

1200
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,480
um going back to the traffic right

1201
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,400
you're sitting in traffic and you're

1202
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,079
wishing traffic is moving you wish

1203
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,180
you're wishing you're not there you know

1204
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,079
you're waiting for something better

1205
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,400
you're waiting for traffic to move but

1206
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,319
it's not happening

1207
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:26,760
so

1208
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,339
what we want is traffic to move so we're

1209
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,680
distracted by our want for traffic to

1210
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,720
move traffic is not going anywhere it's

1211
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,579
not going anywhere so what else can you

1212
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,260
think about in that time

1213
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,760
that can help you move forward in life

1214
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,460
to get to where you want to be

1215
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,920
right instead of wasting time wishing

1216
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,260
that this wasn't happening even though

1217
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,460
that it is

1218
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,960
what can you do

1219
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,460
spend that time more wisely

1220
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,319
let's go back to what's important now

1221
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:57,000
what makes you happy

1222
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,800
maybe you can spend that time thinking

1223
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,380
about your next move

1224
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,359
what's your next step in life to make to

1225
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,760
help you get to where you want to be

1226
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,200
all right

1227
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,540
really Embrace reality man uh

1228
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,760
resistance to eye wheat so i i w i i

1229
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,380
stands for

1230
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,400
it is what it is

1231
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,660
it is what it is

1232
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,460
so you have to really

1233
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,619
Embrace reality because a lot of times

1234
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,180
most of our issues or a lot of our

1235
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,380
issues

1236
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,119
are not accepting things the way they

1237
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,800
are

1238
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,619
right but a lot of times it goes back to

1239
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,180
even though you may not like the way

1240
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,280
something is can you change it or can

1241
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,560
you control it

1242
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,599
if you can it's time to move on and then

1243
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,760
ask yourself once one more time is it

1244
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,200
important to you

1245
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,660
does it make you happy

1246
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,300
end of the day though

1247
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,960
it is what it is

1248
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,700
i-i-w-i-i Embrace reality that'll make

1249
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,520
your life a lot easier

1250
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,759
foreign

1251
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,660
so whatever way you've been thinking

1252
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,000
whatever way we've been thinking we've

1253
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,339
been thinking this way our entire lives

1254
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:15,720
right because when we're born we're

1255
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,000
brought up we're conditioned thank you

1256
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,900
um

1257
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,000
we're conditioned by our environment

1258
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,280
by the people in our household by the

1259
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
people in our community

1260
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,880
right we're all we're all conditioned by

1261
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,680
those people and

1262
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,240
the way we're conditioned is by

1263
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,819
repetition these thoughts and ideas are

1264
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,560
constantly repeated

1265
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,300
and that becomes part of our belief

1266
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,040
system

1267
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,140
it's just like working out you want to

1268
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,540
change your mindset

1269
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,819
it's like working out you can't you

1270
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:46,859
can't look at some dumbbells

1271
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,800
and get get stronger

1272
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,660
you gotta actually pick them up and move

1273
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,740
them a little bit

1274
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,859
right but you got to do it constantly

1275
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,359
if I tell you working out makes you

1276
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,500
stronger

1277
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,480
and you go down to the gym in the in the

1278
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,980
hotel and you work out for one day and

1279
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,780
you come back to me and go hey man this

1280
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,060
didn't work I was in that gym for a

1281
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,339
whole 45 minutes I've been in the mirror

1282
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,480
for the last hour I don't see any

1283
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,339
difference

1284
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,740
it takes time like we talked about

1285
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,420
earlier change takes time repetition

1286
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,839
takes time just like football practice

1287
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,760
I hated football practice

1288
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,680
didn't like it because it was hard and

1289
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,420
you sweat and you get you get you get

1290
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,060
hurt but you know how you get better

1291
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,800
repetition

1292
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,960
repetition if anybody here is good at

1293
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,800
anything

1294
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,140
it's because you do it often

1295
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,000
right it's not rocket science if you if

1296
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,440
you're good at anything it's because you

1297
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,060
spend a lot of time doing it and you do

1298
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,859
it over and over and over again that's

1299
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,119
why you hear about basketball players

1300
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,859
staying in the gym shooting a thousand

1301
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,079
foul shots after practice

1302
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,520
right if you want something to sink in

1303
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,319
or you want to get better

1304
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,660
repetition is key

1305
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,460
eventually you have to let go of what

1306
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,440
you think should happen and live into

1307
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,020
what is happening

1308
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,599
O'Brien

1309
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:01,560
um

1310
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,119
this is what we talked about earlier let

1311
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,839
me see what we are

1312
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,760
all right new mindset

1313
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,680
worrying works

1314
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,540
90 of the things we worry about never

1315
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,760
happen

1316
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,619
ninety percent of the things so it must

1317
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:17,640
work right

1318
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,140
if you want something you don't want

1319
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,520
something to happen worry about it

1320
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,460
Embrace an unpredictable future

1321
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,079
every morning

1322
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,180
only look back or rewind

1323
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,119
for lessons and triumphs

1324
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,920
I know you guys

1325
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,960
because this is an uncertain time

1326
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,940
and

1327
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,859
a lot of things are up in the air right

1328
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:42,300
we don't we don't know what's going to

1329
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,619
happen next

1330
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:45,839
very unpredictable and that causes worry

1331
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,240
it causes anxiety

1332
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,400
but for your entire lives you've waken

1333
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,599
up every morning

1334
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,839
not knowing what was going to happen

1335
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,400
you don't we don't know what's going to

1336
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,619
happen from day to day so Embrace that

1337
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,900
it goes back to embracing reality and

1338
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,000
the way this life works

1339
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,619
right

1340
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:08,420
when you look back on life's lessons

1341
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,480
don't focus on the bad stuff

1342
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,160
because what happens is

1343
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,339
you're doing it and right now in this

1344
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,420
minute

1345
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,240
if you're focusing on bad stuff

1346
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,880
now your current moment is distracted

1347
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,680
and you feel bad because you're thinking

1348
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,819
about something that happened in the

1349
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,380
past

1350
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,140
only look back on things that happen in

1351
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,700
your life for lessons because you don't

1352
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,140
want to repeat mistakes

1353
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,579
do the same thing that got you in

1354
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,140
trouble the first time

1355
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,599
or triumphs things when you were things

1356
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,880
that make you feel good

1357
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,400
right and the biggest reason we do this

1358
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,720
is because everything that's happened in

1359
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,160
the past

1360
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,680
can't change it

1361
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,079
there's no time machine uh Wayne Dyer

1362
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,880
has a book called gifts from icus where

1363
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,020
he talks about

1364
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,000
um

1365
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,500
it's a it's a

1366
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,900
there's a planet parallel to Earth and

1367
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,520
it's called icus and the only difference

1368
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,280
between icus and Earth is that every day

1369
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,140
before you go to bed

1370
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,780
you get to change one thing that happens

1371
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,760
you get to rewind time and go back and

1372
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,619
change one thing

1373
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,140
we live on earth we don't live on icus

1374
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,119
we can't change anything we can't matter

1375
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,440
of fact Shoulda

1376
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,900
should could wood shouldn't be

1377
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,180
in our dictionary nothing makes sense

1378
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,240
either you did or you did right Coulda

1379
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,520
Shoulda Woulda what does that mean

1380
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,040
did you do it or did you not do it very

1381
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,220
simple

1382
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,359
revisiting pain is counterproductive we

1383
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:37,859
just talked about that

1384
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:39,839
most humans want surroundings to be

1385
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,359
permanent steady and reliable and secure

1386
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,579
and predictable reality is you have to

1387
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:47,040
take into account the opposite and up

1388
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,140
unpredictable that are present in every

1389
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,098
experience you have

1390
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,780
remember life is our school and our

1391
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,980
teacher life is how we learn

1392
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,780
we talked about this already recall that

1393
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,000
trial and error our teachers mistakes

1394
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,920
are essential because they show us what

1395
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,020
doesn't work

1396
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,540
I've not failed I just found 10 000 ways

1397
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,400
that don't work

1398
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,780
just Thomas Edison when he's trying to

1399
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,880
invent the light bulb one of his quotes

1400
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,440
uh-huh

1401
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:34,619
all right hold on peace of mind

1402
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,240
anything that cost you your peace of

1403
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,220
mind is too expensive

1404
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,160
anything that costs you a peace of mind

1405
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,480
it's too expensive I don't know what's

1406
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,720
going on somebody's hacking my computer

1407
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,640
I need help somebody's got my back all

1408
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,700
right well come on over here um also uh

1409
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,099
another quote I used to say it costs you

1410
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,440
nothing if you pay it no mine

1411
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,859
costs you nothing if you pay it no mind

1412
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,480
remind ourselves that we have new eyes

1413
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,579
and are looking through a brand new lens

1414
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:05,819
so we're going to reset and restart

1415
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:08,460
each day

1416
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,140
so

1417
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,240
change sometimes can be can be daunting

1418
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,700
right it can feel like an overwhelming

1419
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,619
task at times

1420
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:18,059
anybody have New Year's resolutions

1421
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,680
anybody ever set New Year's resolutions

1422
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,359
anybody ever get past a month

1423
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,079
good good for you yeah you're right

1424
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:26,819
kinda

1425
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,339
the first day New Year's Day your

1426
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:31,619
resolutions nine times out of ten you

1427
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,660
knock them out the box right like you

1428
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,280
hit a grand slam everything that you

1429
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,920
want to do your new life your new goals

1430
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,559
Everything Is Right on point on that day

1431
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,619
New Year's day maybe January 2nd maybe

1432
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:47,579
January 3rd January 10th gets real shaky

1433
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,559
right

1434
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,300
so instead of biting off more than we

1435
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,660
can chew your new day

1436
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,300
is like New Year's Day

1437
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,280
but you got to restart and reset every

1438
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,319
single morning I can do anything for one

1439
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,760
day

1440
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,180
for a week not really sure where I've

1441
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,119
had success is starting off

1442
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,440
every morning

1443
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,119
and saying today I'm not going to have a

1444
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,760
I'm not going to have a Coke today

1445
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,260
just for today I'm not going to have a

1446
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,460
Coke

1447
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,040
and then I'll start again tomorrow

1448
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,079
all right so if you want to bite off

1449
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,440
if you want your goals just to be easier

1450
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,300
take them day by day your new day

1451
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,480
today I no longer need to change the

1452
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,859
world around me I just need to change

1453
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,599
the way I see it that's Gabrielle

1454
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,099
Bernstein who also has a bunch of

1455
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,819
Awesome books

1456
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,460
remember it's always now o'clock and we

1457
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,240
are rewiring and resurrecting our minds

1458
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,079
reprogramming them thought by thought

1459
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,540
Moment by moment and day by day it takes

1460
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,859
time so respect the process

1461
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,940
the primary cause of unhappiness is

1462
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,319
never the situation

1463
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,579
but your thoughts about it

1464
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,460
and I'm going to open it up for

1465
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,839
questions here

1466
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,760
in just a second how many dads we got in

1467
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,220

1470
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,940
so this is the this is the counter to

1471
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,740
the my Thomas Edison quote that I

1472
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,420
thought was pretty successful I mean

1473
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,500
pretty good

1474
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,140
um what do you do

1475
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,839
anybody anybody gonna answer what do you

1476
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,300
do I don't know I'm not sure

1477
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,540
uh State of Mind no we're not

1478
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,640
this is about conversations

1479
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,700
um

1480
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,590
[Music]

[Applause]

1482
00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:56,359
Happy Father's Day

1483
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,819
all right so we got a few more minutes

1484
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,140
it's been about five minutes

1485
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,140
all right I want to take some questions

1486
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,880
open up to the floor anybody's got any

1487
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,940
questions comments concerns

1488
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,400
yes um you know I find myself some days

1489
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,900
I had like a

1490
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,520
really anything done you know whatever

1491
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,980
my tasks are to get completed other days

1492
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,839
that's not the case but what do you do

1493
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,740
when you have a lot

1494
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,839
a lack of motivation

1495
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,700
um

1496
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,500
you just got to find a way

1497
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,819
you know usually um

1498
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,700
you so

1499
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,900
if you're doing something that you

1500
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,839
really love or you want to do motivation

1501
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,599
is very easy to find

1502
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,319
um

1503
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,819
maybe you're in a job or something that

1504
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:50,700
that challenges you

1505
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,440
you got to figure out what works for you

1506
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,720
you know and just and for everybody in

1507
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,540
here I hope a couple people take what I

1508
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,880
take what I said and maybe you can help

1509
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,680
it can be helpful in life it's not going

1510
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,599
to work for everybody we all learn

1511
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,460
different ways you know one of my other

1512
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,680
issues with with our schooling system is

1513
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,760
that

1514
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,920
all kids we all learn differently you

1515
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,540
know there's not one size fits all for

1516
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,619
everybody and that's not just school

1517
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,359
it's life in general

1518
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,020
um

1519
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,400
but I guess when you're looking for

1520
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,599
motivation

1521
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,339
try to find something what whatever

1522
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,260
you're doing why is that important to

1523
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,099
you

1524
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:24,660
right or what makes you happy and and

1525
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,220
the biggest thing like I just said

1526
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,140
remember the days that went good and

1527
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,940
remember what happened on those days and

1528
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,319
what you were thinking and how you were

1529
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,079
feeling and try to mimic that every

1530
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,640
morning when you wake up so usually when

1531
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,380
I wake up in the morning I have

1532
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,700
I pray

1533
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,339
I have some cars that I that I um that I

1534
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:45,780
have some affirmations on

1535
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,000
and then I meditate

1536
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,760
usually when I travel like this morning

1537
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,160
I was concerned about doing this so I

1538
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,660
didn't do that

1539
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,339
um but usually when I'm having an off

1540
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:59,460
day it goes directly back to my morning

1541
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,859
and how I prepare to get my mind right

1542
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:04,400
for that day

1543
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,260
yeah no worries

1544
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,680
questions

1545
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,460
um so I retired when I was 34. my

1546
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,460
initial thought was uh I'm gonna do

1547
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,200
absolutely nothing and travel the world

1548
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,059
with some of this money that I made

1549
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,040
and after about three months I was bored

1550
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,319
out of my mind

1551
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,000
um so that's when I had to figure out

1552
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,640
something to do you know um that's where

1553
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,440
all the acting stuff come comes in the

1554
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,020
writing and producing

1555
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,819
um the mindfulness stuff this

1556
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:47,400
mindfulness program really

1557
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,160
is a culmination of all the uh

1558
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,359
self-help books that I've read over my

1559
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:55,799
entire life

1560
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:57,420
and I just put them into a formula

1561
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,180
that's easy to to follow along and easy

1562
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,260
to remember that's why it's called

1563
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,540
remind because

1564
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,160
I know how to live a fulfilled life and

1565
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,299
I know how to do what make what's

1566
00:56:06,299 --> 00:56:07,680
important to me and what makes me happy

1567
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,260
but sometimes we just forget and usually

1568
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,280
when we forget it's because we're

1569
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,299
emotional

1570
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:14,579
right so

1571
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,799
um but that is it's a challenge for a

1572
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,900
lot of a lot of players

1573
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,280
um when they retire trying to figure out

1574
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,780
what the next step is because we've been

1575
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,900
athletes our entire lives

1576
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,059
how do you decide personally when to

1577
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,500
change your perspective about something

1578
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,000
like you've been describing it to us

1579
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,099
versus change your situation and change

1580
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:34,700
your environment

1581
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,740
I decide usually when I'm stressed

1582
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,319
when I'm stressed I've realized that

1583
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,599
I'm thinking I'm whatever I'm thinking I

1584
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,799
need to adjust

1585
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:44,940
because I don't want to be stressed

1586
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,500
right nobody wants to be stressed like I

1587
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,359
said the goal is peace of mind

1588
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:49,980
so

1589
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,319
a lot of times the only time I use this

1590
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,059
is when I get emotional

1591
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:55,619
yeah you know what I mean because like

1592
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,599
if life is going fine keep doing

1593
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,799
whatever you're doing

1594
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,319
just keep you know what I mean but when

1595
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,460
those moments when you get emotional

1596
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,720
those are the times when you're like

1597
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,459
okay I gotta I gotta change something

1598
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:10,700
uh yes

1599
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,720
my number one book oh man

1600
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,760
um

1601
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,260
probably A Course in Miracles

1602
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,839
but it's it's long and it it looks like

1603
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,119
the Bible and it's written on the same

1604
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,280
paper as the Bible

1605
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,240
um

1606
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,799
but that's as far as changing your

1607
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,740
mindset and like I said

1608
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,200
what the book defines as a miracle is a

1609
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,880
change in your perception or a change in

1610
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,200
the way you think but also A New Earth

1611
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,900
by Eckhart Tolle is really good

1612
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,980
um

1613
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,200
this thing uh

1614
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,180
Wayne Dyer have has a book called change

1615
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,619
your thoughts change your life which is

1616
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:49,200
based on the uh yeah so that's probably

1617
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,700
it

1618
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,559
uh all right cool thank you guys for

1619
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,740
listening

1620
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,719
[Applause]
