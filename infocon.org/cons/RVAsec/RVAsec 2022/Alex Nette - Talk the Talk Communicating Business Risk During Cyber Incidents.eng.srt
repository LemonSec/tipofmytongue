1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,400
hey everybody welcome back

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,439
uh the good news is today's talk uh is

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,960
talk the talk communicating business

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
risk during cyber incidents uh all

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,960
incidents are incidents including the

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
fire drill that we just had uh i pulled

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,640
that as part of this mostly because i

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,599
wanted to have the least number of

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,040
people in here to hear what i'm talking

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,280
about so welcome back

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
uh my name is alex nettie i am the ceo

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,879
and co-founder of a cyber security

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
services firm based out of richmond here

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,280
uh and ultimately from my side a little

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,399
bit on my background

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,760
i worked across a number of different

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
spaces both in the public and private

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,120
sectors i've also worked through a lot

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,480
of different disciplines within cyber

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
security i started out originally

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,760
information insurance got way down in

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,879
the nitty gritty and vulnerability

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,039
management and apsec and came back up

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
eventually to overall strategy uh it

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,039
took me through a series of incident

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,520
response roles both building programs uh

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,879
and participating in those instant

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,640
response functions across multiple

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,479
fortune 500 companies

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,479
a big part of today's talk though is

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,439
talking about incident response so

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,200
picture this uh it's a quiet friday

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,400
afternoon or in this case maybe a

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
thursday afternoon you've just gotten

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,040
back from a fire drill you have all of

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,880
the food that you need

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
and

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,759
oh no hackers in the mainframe uh

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,439
everything falls apart you've just been

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,479
kicking it with your friends you've been

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,840
talking about the latest controls you

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
want to implement or talk about ssdlc

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,960
trying to figure out how to make your

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
program better and everything gets

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
turned on its head and it kind of ruins

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
your day

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
the biggest thing though of course is

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,119
you say cool no problem we have an

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,720
instant response plan let's roll this

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
out how many of you guys participate

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,320
currently in the incident response

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,880
function at your company

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,920
trick question you all should have

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,759
raised your hand right everybody has a

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
role but there are some of you who are

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,880
experts in this so i'm not going to dive

57
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,119
into cybersecurity and the response at a

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,960
high level though it basically looks

59
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
like this preparation getting ready for

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,399
an incident and this comes from nist

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,320
incident response framework

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,119
you eventually want to move into

63
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,719
detection analysis you have to be able

64
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
to detect an incident in order to

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,318
respond to it can't detect it can't

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,440
respond

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
that moves to containment eradication

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
and recovery how are you actually going

69
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
to handle getting rid of that problem

70
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
and recovering from it that middle part

71
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,239
though is cyclical as you find out new

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,239
information you have to move to contain

73
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,520
it and it's over and over until

74
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
eventually you get some level of

75
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,920
confidence that you're done with the

76
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,959
incident

77
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,959
finally post instant activity how do we

78
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
prevent this from happening again which

79
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,959
of course takes you all the way back to

80
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,280
the beginning

81
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
so uh here from the budget version of

82
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
inception called tenant uh we all

83
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,800
believe we'd run into a burning building

84
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
but until we feel the heat we can never

85
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,879
know you do uh how many of you felt a

86
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
little bit confused when jake came up

87
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,440
here and said there's a fire

88
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
i honestly thought he was kidding uh

89
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,319
right he's coming up here saying there's

90
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,200
a fire you need to get out of the

91
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,840
building there's a little bit of

92
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
confusion where do we go who do we talk

93
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
to where is the fire am i smelling smoke

94
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
right you're having all these reactions

95
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,239
and you're panicking this is the biggest

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,280
thing to talk about with incident

97
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
response is that panic is such a hard

98
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,959
thing to overcome and we'll talk a lot

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,879
about repetition here with understanding

100
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
and getting comfortable in that space

101
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,280
that's the first thing you have to be in

102
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
as an incident responder or really just

103
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
in a company or in a company and

104
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
functioning in that function of instant

105
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,879
response living in the uncomfortable not

106
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,800
knowing all of the information uh think

107
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
about when you see some shocking news on

108
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,000
tv you want more information you want to

109
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,319
make sense of it you turn to conspiracy

110
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
theories or whatever other dark web

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
areas you're going to spin into or deep

112
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,480
depths of twitter to try to find out

113
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
answers that's what we do as humans you

114
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
have to be okay with not jumping to

115
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
conclusions

116
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
ultimately you have to have the right

117
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,319
people the processes and technology to

118
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,080
be able to get those answers we talked

119
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,159
about that detection and finding all the

120
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,519
information you need to be able to

121
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
respond to an incident

122
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,360
uh eventually though if it was just you

123
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
and your cybersecurity colleagues you

124
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
could probably take all day right you

125
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
could spin through the logs and pull all

126
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,280
the information and get everything back

127
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
up and recover from backups the problem

128
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,840
is it's not just you there's a whole

129
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,560
company outside of you you are just part

130
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
of it and that's a hard pill to swallow

131
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
let's talk business

132
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,239
uh when we think about the relationship

133
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,959
between business and i.t on a level set

134
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,720
on this real quick

135
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
here's a good example in the olden days

136
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,000
we had hospital beds and we had paper on

137
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
the end of the bed right that's the

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
chart for the patient it tracks

139
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
medication vitals other prescriptions

140
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
recommendations from the doctor but

141
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
eventually we realized if we put on a

142
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
computer you could access multiple

143
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
patients from one place made it faster

144
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
to pull up and store that information

145
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
eventually move to much bigger computers

146
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
the cloud to be able to manage that

147
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
across the world and pull out much

148
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
bigger health outcomes ai and everything

149
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,199
else feeding that

150
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,520
that's what it is

151
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
there's a perception problem though when

152
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
we think about i.t

153
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
we think about companies use or used to

154
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
be doing business by paper we think

155
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
about taking it to electronic methods

156
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,720
for convenience speed and efficiency and

157
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
we think about cyber security how can we

158
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
secure that electronic information the

159
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
exact same way we used to secure paper

160
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,639
that's awesome the problem is your

161
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,479
organization is thinking about it very

162
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,639
different we do i t because everyone

163
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,720
else is doing it they said i need a dark

164
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,440
web powered blockchain ai

165
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
whatever to make all this work cyber

166
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,880
security is not a value added

167
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,400
organization how many of you heard that

168
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
one

169
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
and there's a bunch of jargon and other

170
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
stuff that organizations talk about

171
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,919
that's a huge divide and this is what

172
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,120
we're talking about today is how to

173
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
bridge that gap

174
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
you need to step into someone else's

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,520
shoes haha business look at this guy

176
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
he's having a great time

177
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
is that what you think of when you think

178
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
of your business leaders hopefully

179
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
because that's probably about a good

180
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
good summation of who they are

181
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
the problem with business leaders is

182
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
that they're wearing a lot of hats and

183
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,960
here's my boy from caps for sale an old

184
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
children's book if you know it but look

185
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
at all these roles that we have that are

186
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
coming out here

187
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
there's all kinds of stuff that business

188
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
leaders have to worry about and it's not

189
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
always just independent if you work at a

190
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
smaller company there's probably some of

191
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,759
your leadership that are wearing

192
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
multiple hats right now there's not

193
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
always a direct hiring manager or

194
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
marketing trends manager or payroll or

195
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,199
i.t or insurances there might be

196
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,880
somebody wearing multiple pieces of this

197
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
puzzle and you have to know that as a

198
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,880
cyber security person

199
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
a lot of these people have skills that

200
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
you don't have and that's okay that's

201
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,120
why we're dividing and conquering and

202
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
we're building part of a business the

203
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
larger company the more people might fit

204
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
in in these individual buckets and again

205
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,759
there might be people that are wearing

206
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,440
multiple hats

207
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
what does it boil down to

208
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
cia triad boring not going to talk about

209
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
it

210
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
but business leaders don't care and

211
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
boring the only thing they care about is

212
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
reputation of the company how do we make

213
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
sales how do we keep this going how do

214
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
we make this company work because if the

215
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
company doesn't work we as cyber

216
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,319
security professionals are out of jobs

217
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
reputation the umami of cyber security

218
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,039
so back to friday afternoon

219
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,599
there you are robot hanging out

220
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,840
you're getting inquiries

221
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,520
co-workers hey is something going on

222
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,280
with our product what's up

223
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
little g chat

224
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,319
help desk we're getting reports that

225
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,720
users can't access the product

226
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,560
coming from business leaders why am i

227
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,919
hearing the product is down are we in

228
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
violation of our slas or our customers

229
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,199
going to sue us do i need to fire up our

230
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,479
lawyers

231
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,720
and vendors hey all our integrations

232
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
aren't working what's going on

233
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
all of those things boil down to a big

234
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,479
core idea here

235
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,599
and ultimately you come back and you

236
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,800
probably say something like we're

237
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
investigating

238
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,400
the core ask here and the root of the

239
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
question that's coming in from all these

240
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
people is what's going on and how do we

241
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
fix it they want the same thing they

242
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,080
want to protect the reputation of the

243
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
company so all of these things and these

244
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
answers their questions that's the route

245
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
that they're trying to get to if you say

246
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,120
we're investigating you've said the

247
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,039
wrong answer

248
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,479
customers we got a weird email is

249
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,000
something going on

250
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
news outlet we received a tip you're

251
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
being ransomed sure why not

252
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
or regulatory body we saw tweet that

253
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
you've had a data breach true

254
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,599
we're investigating wrong

255
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
what's the core ask here we need

256
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
information answers now that's what

257
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,520
we're looking for we need to know how to

258
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,960
handle this and manage this ourselves

259
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,639
externally though

260
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
there's you again industry peers are you

261
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,879
hacked tell us what happened so we can

262
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,879
stop it too we care about us but like

263
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,360
you got any uh any iocs anything you can

264
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
share with us

265
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
cyber companies we're hearing bad things

266
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,440
and we're at your service for a fee

267
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,960
and the government

268
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
hi we're hearing something's going on

269
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,639
how can we help how many of you have had

270
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,919
a conversation with somebody from the

271
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,879
fbi dhs or cisa

272
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,479
they have a lot of great tools and stuff

273
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,159
but they want to help the question is

274
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,839
you may have sat down and said i

275
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,279
legitimately don't know how you could

276
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
help us you don't know our environment

277
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
what do you have that can help me

278
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,240
but they're coming in saying we want to

279
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
help

280
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,959
that's the key function here you

281
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
probably answered we're investigating

282
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,399
but they're saying how can we help you

283
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,920
with this issue

284
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,360
the question is do you need help maybe

285
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
you don't know that's okay

286
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
in reality there's you in the middle and

287
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
here's all these people

288
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,640
but the problem is i showed all those

289
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,320
arrows always coming in to you every

290
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
time and it doesn't look like that in

291
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
reality it is insane there's errors

292
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
going every which way someone contacts a

293
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
news media outlet who contacts you who

294
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,959
talks to a regulatory body who talks to

295
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,399
an executive who talks to his buddy that

296
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,320
he golfs with who works at a news media

297
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
outlet and it ends up being the spider

298
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
web of nonsense going all around and so

299
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
the problem is you're no longer the

300
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
focal point you're just on the bottom of

301
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,920
this stack of a lot of people with a lot

302
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
of different interests trying to find

303
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
out how to fix this problem

304
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
and what do you probably hit them with

305
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
we're investigating oh man wrong answer

306
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
does that look familiar same thing rat's

307
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,839
nest for any of you who've ever worked

308
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,839
in a dc that's exactly what that

309
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,920
actually looks like an incident it is

310
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,440
bonkers i don't know how to put this

311
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,959
politely the problem is is that you

312
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,640
can't plan for everything that's ever

313
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
going to happen in a cyber incident

314
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
there are so many plays if you will that

315
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,440
happen you could never anticipate them

316
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
a hilarious story and i'll leave this uh

317
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
company redacted there is a shredit

318
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,080
truck that had come up to shred a bunch

319
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
of pii evidence for this company it was

320
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
all kinds of banking information

321
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,519
financial information

322
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
and the truck jammed up and they said

323
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,519
cool our shredders busted we're gonna

324
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,880
bring in a new shredder truck and they

325
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,959
drove off down the road the problem was

326
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,560
there were still checks and account

327
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
balances and financial information

328
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
sitting in the hopper and as they drove

329
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
down the road the exhaust pipe on the

330
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
top took those pieces of paper up and

331
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
just literally distributed them down the

332
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,160
road and a good samaritan called us up

333
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
and said hey i am finding a lot of your

334
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
financial information lying on the side

335
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,079
of this road it's just a long line of

336
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,120
documents blowing around out here

337
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
what the hell do you do

338
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
did you plan for that no that is the

339
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
most ridiculous thing you've ever heard

340
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
of it's bridging physical and cyber

341
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
security sure definitely information

342
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,079
protection but you can't plan for that

343
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
and you have to respond accordingly

344
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
so we've got to think about what are the

345
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
priorities then for the business

346
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
for you

347
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,519
it's an instant response life cycle

348
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,040
tried and trued by nist it's got

349
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
everything you need you've got thoughts

350
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,399
and plans and everything else that goes

351
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,680
with it

352
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,519
however your business leader priorities

353
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
again it's that reputation cloud

354
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,040
ultimately it's them saying what's going

355
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
on and how do we fix it they're trying

356
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,320
to protect the reputation of the company

357
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
that makes sense that's the whole point

358
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,839
of being a business

359
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
but external entities also have other

360
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
priorities things like we need

361
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
information answers now and how can we

362
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
help you with this issue all those core

363
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
things that we talked about so now we

364
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
have all of these different things

365
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
happening as a result of what's going on

366
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
so how do we go from this

367
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
racing point in a few years ago just

368
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,720
absolutely botching this pit stop

369
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,519
to world record pit stop instead

370
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,920
that's the efficiency that's unraveling

371
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
that rats nest how do we reduce that and

372
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
change ultimately how we approach

373
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
incident response

374
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
the key here is communicating during a

375
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
cyber incident

376
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,279
we talked a little bit about this where

377
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,800
everyone is at a disadvantage right from

378
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,639
the start of an incident the first

379
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,680
things first there's different

380
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,360
priorities everybody has a different

381
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
view about what they need to do as a

382
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
result of their job

383
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,000
you have a different priority than those

384
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
business leaders than external entities

385
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
and even your co-workers and that puts

386
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,880
you in an interesting position to have

387
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
to figure out how to bridge that gap

388
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,480
the second thing there's different

389
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,839
expertise you're a cyber security

390
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
practitioner or rit and you're working

391
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
in the space and so you know what you

392
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,639
need to do to maybe bring something back

393
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,360
online restore from backups closed ports

394
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,959
whatever it might be

395
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,880
but your cfo has a different expertise

396
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
and accounting has a different expertise

397
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
and hr has a different expertise and

398
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
corporate communications can write way

399
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
better than you could ever write

400
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,839
so how do we manage all of those pieces

401
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,279
third there's different ways of working

402
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,880
some people are working agile some

403
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,959
people are working waterfalls some

404
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,639
people are working ad hoc some people

405
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
whatever other cmmi jargon you want to

406
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,760
throw out there but everybody works

407
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
different some people are in slack some

408
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
people are still sending emails and

409
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,639
somebody in your office is still

410
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,560
printing emails and hand delivering them

411
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,079
you know it

412
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,120
but there's different ways of

413
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
communicating there's different ways

414
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
that we talk as humans this is a big

415
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,160
piece the puzzle when we think about who

416
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,600
we are as humans we have different ways

417
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,320
of talking about the same thing if we

418
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,760
gave a brief to all of you right now and

419
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,279
ask you to come up and present on it

420
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,399
every single one of you would have a

421
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,519
different take a different way of

422
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
presenting it and a different way of

423
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
communicating that issue

424
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
that is the biggest burden when it comes

425
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
to cyber security incidents it's not

426
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
actually solving the problem

427
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
it's figuring out how to speak the same

428
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,959
language everybody is different jargon

429
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,120
cfo's up there talking about ebitda or

430
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
stocks or whatever else you're down here

431
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
talking about vulnerabilities

432
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
none of that makes sense to the other

433
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,000
person so where do we go do we go closer

434
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
to business leaders to be able to meet

435
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
them in running the business do they

436
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
need to come to us

437
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
i think it's somewhere in the middle

438
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
when we think about something like data

439
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
breaches and let's talk about this a

440
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
little bit uh this was a study that we

441
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
did late last year uh and what we did

442
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,240
was we took a little bit of what the

443
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
industry is reporting so in this case

444
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,920
taking the verizon dbir and looked at

445
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,079
what breaches are actually happening and

446
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
so you can see it's things like social

447
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,800
engineering basic web application

448
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
attacks system intrusion miscellaneous

449
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
errors privilege misuse lost and stolen

450
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,160
assets what does that mean to a ceo

451
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,639
nothing what's a social engineering

452
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,600
what's a misuse what's a back door i

453
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
have five on my lambo or whatever

454
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
they're driving these days it makes no

455
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,320
sense to them

456
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
the thing though with the dbir is that

457
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,279
you can see it's pretty well spread out

458
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,560
between things like social engineering

459
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
basic web application attacks and system

460
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
intrusion that makes sense right that

461
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
jives roughly with what we know about

462
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
attack vectors today and i know there's

463
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,639
a new dbir out i'll update this data

464
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,560
eventually here

465
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
what gets tricky then is what are people

466
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
talking about in academia so we go to

467
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,399
something like site.ai and we start to

468
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,839
search on some different fields things

469
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,279
like social engineering and basic web

470
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,800
application attacks and no surprise

471
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,480
we're talking more from an academic

472
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,399
standpoint about system intrusion the

473
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
cool stuff of cyber security nobody

474
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
wants to write about social engineering

475
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,320
and academia

476
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
but here's a problem what is your ceo

477
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
seeing every morning when he turns on

478
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
the news the new york times or opens up

479
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,199
the sweet light pink pages of the

480
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,920
financial times he's seeing the cool

481
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,560
stuff because it's cool he's not hearing

482
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,839
about the number one attack vector

483
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
social engineering that's barely down

484
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,720
there in the new york times in the

485
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,639
guardian some of those other categories

486
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,760
aren't even up there no one's talking

487
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,440
about denial of service in the news

488
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,320
which is bonkers so from that standpoint

489
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
already you're behind you're not talking

490
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,079
about the same level of interest in

491
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,160
these individual categories

492
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,000
even worse someone then goes to google

493
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
and it turns out they're only looking up

494
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
the cool stuff they're not looking up

495
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,959
the stuff that's actually impacting the

496
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,800
business do you even see basic web

497
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
application attacks on there and we just

498
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,839
talked about that being the number one

499
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,800
problem

500
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
so that is a huge problem right from the

501
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
start if you have never talked to your

502
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
ceo cfo or any of your other leadership

503
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
you're already behind that's a huge

504
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
problem so again how do we bridge that

505
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
gap we got to communicate for success

506
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,680
first things first what is impacted

507
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,279
we're having this cyber incident and

508
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
what is the problem is it email is it a

509
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,959
product is it an app is it something

510
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,519
else wireless whatever it might be

511
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,079
tell them what is impacted the key

512
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,440
though in telling them

513
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,040
is you're probably thinking about i.t

514
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,360
impacts about the specific system app

515
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
database server they don't care

516
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,839
what they care about is that business

517
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,600
process we talked about that earlier how

518
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
business process is tied directly to it

519
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,120
you buy it to support business processes

520
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
shout this from the rafters to everybody

521
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,639
who's in your leadership

522
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,920
if you don't know all of the business

523
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
processes that a system and app supports

524
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,360
if you guys have salesforce and you

525
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
don't know how you're using salesforce

526
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
you better find out because now if

527
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,639
salesforce goes down you can't

528
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,560
communicate what's broken is it just

529
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,040
your sales cycle or is it the website or

530
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,639
all of your inbound marketing or this

531
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,480
conference that you're having right now

532
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,000
you have to be able to understand how

533
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
that maps out if you don't the best day

534
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,480
to start is today

535
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
the second thing how long is this going

536
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
to last this is a tough one i don't know

537
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
right maybe i could pull together some

538
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,480
information it's a cloud backup it

539
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,600
depends on how many people are on the

540
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
vpn and the concentrator went down last

541
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
week from a patch and like i don't know

542
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,120
it could be a day it could be 50 days

543
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
that's fine but i don't know is it an

544
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
acceptable answer to an executive we

545
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,839
talked about all the hats that they're

546
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,519
wearing earlier those business leaders

547
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,040
have things they need to do people they

548
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
need to communicate their jobs that they

549
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,679
need to do

550
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,000
so if you're unsure give a range it is

551
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
okay but you're the expert you're

552
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,839
probably the person who can best

553
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
approximate what that time range looks

554
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,760
like you could say it could be anywhere

555
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,799
from an hour to seven days that's a big

556
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,919
difference but at least from an

557
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
executive standpoint now they have

558
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,679
something to work on if there's a sales

559
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,520
cycle or a shareholder meeting coming up

560
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,880
or something else they can plan and do

561
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,480
their job appropriately

562
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,679
the biggest thing at the end of the day

563
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,760
is that reasonable estimate is a huge

564
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
help to them again you're probably the

565
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
best person in the company to give that

566
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,679
estimate so you as an expert need to be

567
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,919
prepared to do so

568
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
where do you need help do you need money

569
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,160
time people uh one of the big things

570
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
that ultimately is for you to be able to

571
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
communicate from that help standpoint

572
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
and say hey

573
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
what do we need help with and more

574
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
importantly what might be something that

575
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
has a broader impact on the business for

576
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
example your email server gets locked up

577
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
and you say if we could just shut down

578
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,799
all email because it's literally just

579
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
crawling right now it's not really

580
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,520
working it's it's in and out and

581
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,200
intermittent if we could shut it down

582
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
for the whole company for 30 minutes we

583
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,799
can restore from backup

584
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,240
that's a conversation that a business

585
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
leader can understand and say yeah i'm

586
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,240
on board for that shut that down

587
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,559
communicate for success are your answers

588
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,760
actionable

589
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,919
don't give somebody wishy-washy answers

590
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,280
give them something that you know

591
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
concretely don't overstate it but find a

592
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
way to give something uh that they can

593
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,640
work with you need to keep the business

594
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
moving again i think one of the most

595
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,520
interesting aspects of being in cyber

596
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
security is that you probably know more

597
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
about some people at your company's jobs

598
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
than they do

599
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,799
i constantly am coming in after hr and

600
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,240
going why don't you have an individual

601
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,600
employee number an individual department

602
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,120
number so i can track this and pivot on

603
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
it and put it in my sim it kills me and

604
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,880
i'm over there trying to tell them how

605
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,200
to do their job right but they do so

606
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,960
much more than that and sometimes we

607
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
come after them thinking we could do

608
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
their jobs but you probably

609
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,760
are not the right person to be sitting

610
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
down and having a tough conversation

611
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,559
with somebody

612
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
you need to respect that and ultimately

613
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,840
that means that you need to give

614
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,440
directions to people so they can keep

615
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
doing their jobs is email down as sales

616
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,000
force down what is our backup plan to

617
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,240
keep things moving your number one goal

618
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,080
is reducing impact to business that is

619
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,679
cyber security

620
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,919
not logs not app security not

621
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,120
vulnerabilities that is what you're

622
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
doing that's the main top level thing

623
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,320
and you've got to be able to communicate

624
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,679
that to business leaders about what that

625
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,280
means

626
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
are you managing expectations there are

627
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
a lot of decisions and actions that can

628
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
be taken by others as a result so going

629
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
back to what i just said you need to be

630
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
able to give them the best information

631
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
so they can be the best at their jobs

632
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
it's okay if that information changes

633
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,120
you ultimately want to make sure that

634
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
you keep giving them that information in

635
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
real time and keep them up to date

636
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
another thing to think about who's

637
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
remote working or out sick we used to

638
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
joke about this during contingency

639
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
planning exercises about like large flu

640
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,679
plagues and lots of people being out at

641
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,520
once and everyone's like oh they're like

642
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
sure that would definitely happen and

643
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,440
then covet hit suddenly that became very

644
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
real and so that's something we have to

645
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,960
think about is if i normally talk to

646
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
this person or this executive who i like

647
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,799
and they're not here today because

648
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,720
they're working remote or we're totally

649
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
remote company or they're out sick or

650
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
their kids are sick or something else is

651
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
happening who else can i talk to you

652
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
need to have a list it's not just one

653
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
person or a small group of people it's a

654
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
bunch of people

655
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,640
constantly communicate this is the

656
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,799
biggest one whatever is going on and you

657
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,080
know as a cyber security incident

658
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
happens it continues to grow and change

659
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
and evolve and you learn more

660
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
information that cycle in the middle

661
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,159
that we were talking about it goes

662
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,000
around and around around you have to

663
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,919
stay in constant contact

664
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,480
if that one hour to seven days estimate

665
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,039
turns into six hours to seven days

666
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,880
you've got to tell somebody if it turns

667
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,400
into six hours to 24 hours tell somebody

668
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
let them know what's going on those

669
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
regular touch points will make a huge

670
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
difference

671
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,159
so after all of that you made it out of

672
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,480
live uh you guys had kind of an ad hoc

673
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
process and you've made it through which

674
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,039
is stupendous so what do you do flex

675
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,840
seal boom we're done here right move on

676
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,440
let's get back to business we got things

677
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,799
going on

678
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,559
yeah you've been there you've been part

679
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,559
of this something went wrong uh let's

680
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,919
just throw some money at it let's bring

681
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,000
in a vendor to talk about it we're gonna

682
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
implement some das tool and call it a

683
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
day and it's never going to happen again

684
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
instead let's think back to that life

685
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,240
cycle preparation let's prepare for the

686
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
uh not unexpected it's expected right

687
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
it's not when an incident will happen

688
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
but if or not if an incident will happen

689
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,440
but when it will happen

690
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
let's talk about contingency planning

691
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,679
when we think about contingency planning

692
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,840
or the cp family nist or whatever you're

693
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,520
thinking about cyber security but it's

694
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,320
so much bigger than just you

695
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,919
it's about focusing on business

696
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,000
processes how do we keep the company

697
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
moving that's what we were talking about

698
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
earlier so it's not just about it

699
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,840
systems and apps it's about even other

700
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,240
things like alternate work sites backup

701
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,679
laptops

702
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,880
how many of you know that your company

703
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,280
has a whole storage bin full of laptops

704
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
in a warehouse somewhere that they could

705
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
go pull from

706
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,919
and how many of you have to go dig those

707
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,840
suckers out and apply patches on a

708
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,480
monthly basis because they're not online

709
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,559
that's contingency planning and that

710
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,080
could make a difference for your company

711
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,320
so that's an i.t piece but for everyone

712
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,159
who needs that laptop the hr person the

713
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,400
finance person the facilities person

714
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
that's invaluable

715
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
the second thing disaster recovery

716
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,640
exercises it's not just the after

717
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,880
incident exercise that's the key

718
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,679
no more table top exercises everybody is

719
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,039
talking about this we're done with

720
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
tabletop disaster recovery exercises you

721
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,440
need to actually fail over you need to

722
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
move to a different availability zone

723
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
you need to fail over to a different

724
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
region in the cloud you can't just say

725
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
it works or say the backup works until

726
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,520
you've actually done it and you'd be

727
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,200
surprised when you do it it suddenly

728
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,559
doesn't work and you go man i'm glad we

729
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,840
did this because if things have gone

730
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,960
wrong that would have been a huge

731
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,880
problem you need to actually run those

732
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
real tests to make sure that what you're

733
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
thinking will happen will actually

734
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
happen

735
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,840
your incident response drills this is a

736
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,360
key piece of this puzzle you've got to

737
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
be able to find a way to respond and

738
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
when we talked about that initial flow

739
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
through from the nist side that's great

740
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
that's a lot of individual steps

741
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,919
going through the motions helps you when

742
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,520
we talk about that panic response you've

743
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,039
got to be able to suppress that panic

744
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
response especially as an incident

745
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,880
responder or someone who's in a role

746
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,039
doing incident response if you're part

747
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,799
of the equation even as just a database

748
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,159
administrator but you're going to be

749
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,000
helping with this incident response

750
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
you've got to stay cool calm and

751
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,520
collected that's a huge piece of the

752
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,600
puzzle the biggest thing about incident

753
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,919
response drills is while one talking

754
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,880
through some of these ridiculous

755
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
scenarios like those checks being

756
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,520
distributed down the road they're

757
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
helpful they're great thought exercises

758
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,200
and it could help you in the long run

759
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
it's not about how to respond you could

760
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
never ever ever play book for that

761
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,360
shredding check instant you might you

762
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
might take it back and say hey i heard

763
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,559
alex talk about this ridiculous thing at

764
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,640
this presentation how would we handle

765
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,720
that that's a good one i used to love to

766
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
pull from movies right ridiculous

767
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
scenarios but at the root there's always

768
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,919
something that you can say all right if

769
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,600
godzilla shows up what is the root of

770
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,799
the problem well it's going to be that

771
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
our office is destroyed so the route is

772
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,720
how do we move to a new office and get

773
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
set up and running again all of that is

774
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
helpful but the biggest thing it is

775
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
about building relationships we talked

776
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,000
about building that bridge back to

777
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
business leaders it is about you meeting

778
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
people is about finding a common way to

779
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
talk about the problem and it's about

780
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,000
becoming friends with those people you

781
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
are part of this equation and part of

782
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,159
the larger business if you're now saying

783
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,320
i would love more money

784
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
now you have a face and more importantly

785
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
there's a reason behind that

786
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
that's that post-incident activity

787
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
we're telling business leaders why we

788
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
need more resources and now they've seen

789
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
it right that's a huge piece of the

790
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,400
puzzle they've experienced it firsthand

791
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
i'm not telling you to catch them while

792
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,200
they're off guard but i'm telling you to

793
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,559
catch them while they're off guard while

794
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
it's fresh in their minds take advantage

795
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,279
of that right come up and document all

796
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
the information that you talked about

797
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,640
during that incident and that post

798
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,600
incident

799
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
most importantly this is the key phrase

800
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,799
that will resonate with every single

801
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,039
executive that you talk to to reduce the

802
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,760
risk of this happening again

803
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
dot dot dot say whatever it is you want

804
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,960
to say

805
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,600
that is worth a lot of money right money

806
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,840
time resources people that is what keeps

807
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,520
a business ticking and so to say to

808
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
reduce the risk of this happening again

809
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
can make a huge difference

810
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,039
cyber incidents ultimately have a

811
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,799
demonstrable impact on the business so

812
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,559
you want to make your case right how can

813
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,919
you prevent it from happening again what

814
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,120
are some things we could do what are

815
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
some things we could do better but also

816
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,640
telling the business if there is nothing

817
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
you could have done that is an

818
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,480
acceptable answer to say we could not

819
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,600
have stopped

820
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,080
shredit one of our third-party companies

821
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
from distributing uh you know checks all

822
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,520
down the road what are we supposed to do

823
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
about that

824
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
nothing but having a plan in place to

825
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,559
respond to it when it does happen again

826
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,720
that reduces the risk having a team

827
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
mobilized or understanding that hey

828
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,159
let's just have maybe some garbage bags

829
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,000
down at the security desk so everybody

830
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
can run out and start grabbing those

831
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,520
things off the road that can make a huge

832
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,120
difference that becomes part of a drill

833
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,520
a contingency plan all that feeds back

834
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
into that cycle

835
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,039
document all that in a lessons learned

836
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
after action report executives love

837
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,559
things that are written down i don't

838
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,880
know why maybe they like to read maybe

839
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,000
they're just taking it while they're

840
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,440
jawing around to the caribbean on their

841
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
private jets i don't know what they're

842
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
doing but most importantly you want to

843
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,559
write it down and say hey this is what

844
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,480
happened that's great because now they

845
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
have something that's actionable they

846
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,039
can take it to the board they can take

847
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,720
it to their other business leaders but

848
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,919
it is a cya for your ass to put it down

849
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,600
on paper now you've at least warned them

850
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
and said here is the risk and hopefully

851
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,039
that turns into money becomes an

852
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,640
artifact that ends up in the budget next

853
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,320
year to get a new tool to get more head

854
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,480
count to get more whatever but

855
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,919
ultimately if it doesn't turn anything

856
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,440
at least you wrote it down you said hey

857
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
this was the problem and we tried to fix

858
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,279
it

859
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
at the end of the day we're all the same

860
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,799
hello i like money

861
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
executives we want money for our budgets

862
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,559
executives want it for their stuff

863
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,919
that's fine

864
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,600
but that brings us a lot closer together

865
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,720
than maybe you're giving all of us

866
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
credit for

867
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,679
so how can we get more resources

868
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,440
well let's look at cyber security risk

869
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,120
ratings when we talked about reducing

870
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,799
the risk earlier

871
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,360
when we think about risk we do

872
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,640
likelihood

873
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
and impact and it feeds down into

874
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,440
probability and impact and we multiply

875
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,760
it out and its probability impact equals

876
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
risk

877
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,679
and this heat map from hell and that's

878
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,480
how we talk about it

879
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,159
all that comes together and we say cool

880
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,159
great yeah we've got some impact i got a

881
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,399
high risk what does that mean to an

882
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,520
executive

883
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,200
nothing

884
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,640
what does that mean to mr krabs

885
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,880
hello i like money

886
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,039
that's what resonates we're talking

887
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
about running a business the business's

888
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,720
job is to provide a service which

889
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,919
generally charges money for that service

890
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,080
if you're talking about this

891
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,320
that doesn't resonate with executives so

892
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,440
you got to find a common ground that

893
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
works for them

894
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,240
i'm not talking about your dad's

895
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
cybersecurity risk assessments anymore

896
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,480
cfos and finances have been focused on

897
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
managing money to include earning and

898
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
not losing it for decades cybersecurity

899
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,679
is a new profession shocker cfos and

900
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,679
accountants have been around for a long

901
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,159
long time they may be frustrating and

902
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
annoying for you but they are very good

903
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
at what they do

904
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,520
risk management is a newer role in most

905
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
companies but it's broad right when we

906
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,360
think about looking at 10k reports for

907
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,799
publicly traded companies there's

908
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,640
usually risks documented in there

909
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,279
business risk competitor risk coven 19

910
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,399
risk and in some cases cyber security

911
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,000
risk management those a broader function

912
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
than just cyber security risk management

913
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,039
you need to remember that that risk

914
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,399
management function is probably who's

915
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,679
running those disaster recovery and

916
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,240
contingency planning exercises it's part

917
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
of the broader scope of reducing risk

918
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,000
for the company so they're using things

919
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,600
like probabilities so it's not just it

920
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,200
finally we have contingency planners

921
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,960
like we talked about focus on reducing

922
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,480
downtime and business interruptions

923
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,039
again it's not just about i.t if our

924
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,960
office gets struck by godzilla how do we

925
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
get the office back up and running again

926
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
or where do we go to work

927
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,399
ultimately you've got to speak to your

928
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,760
business leader's language and that's

929
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,039
where there's this new concept called

930
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
quantitative risk that's coming out

931
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
this is a big help uh ultimately we

932
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,799
think about things like loss magnitude

933
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,200
how bad could this be how much money

934
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
could we lose as a result of somebody

935
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,399
getting into this database how much

936
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,039
money is that worth that is quantifiable

937
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,880
right there's enough data in there if

938
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
you're looking for metrics go pull up

939
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,880
the fines for gdpr ccpa they will tell

940
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,039
you how screwed you will be

941
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,880
if that database goes public that's a

942
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,279
number you can tell somebody about that

943
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,880
and if that database isn't protected you

944
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
can say hey

945
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,360
right now i'm guessing it's probably

946
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,120
somewhere between five thousand and five

947
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
million but probably about a hundred

948
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,600
thousand dollars we would get popped

949
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,919
with if things went wrong and uh we

950
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,399
don't have any encryption on it now you

951
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,600
can probably get a tool to get that

952
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,960
encrypted

953
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,399
one of the big things you can say is how

954
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,559
frequently could that happen again you

955
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,000
guys are experts you have the best

956
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,159
guests one in every five years once

957
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,960
every 10 years once every 100 years

958
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,640
there's data out there about how often

959
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
breaches are happening the verizon dbr

960
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,919
is a good report but there's lots of

961
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,880
other data that's starting to be

962
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,799
collected from the industry at large

963
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,480
that starts to fit into this equation as

964
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,440
well

965
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,799
we can then look at things like how to

966
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,200
control it and so we say how much would

967
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,760
we need to invest to fix this problem

968
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,120
looking at things again like the lost

969
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,039
magnitude and loss event frequency from

970
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,399
both of those

971
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,000
and we can pull together and say hey

972
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
we've got all the information we need

973
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
about how much this control would most

974
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,360
likely cost us the hard part is if

975
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,120
there's a whole process to move through

976
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
if we don't know how many people we need

977
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,640
or how long it's going to take us it

978
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,960
could be a range but if somebody shows

979
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
up and says i'm a cyber security vendor

980
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,320
and it's going to cost you 5 million

981
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,159
dollars a year you're lower bound you're

982
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,360
most likely in your upper bound or all

983
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,440
five million because you know the cost

984
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,360
so that makes it easier the question

985
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,799
then becomes for that second part like i

986
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,640
was talking about how much does that

987
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480
actually reduce our risk does it solve

988
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
the problem does it change the math from

989
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
earlier about how frequent it might

990
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,520
happen and more importantly how much it

991
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,279
might cost us

992
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,120
you put all that together and you end up

993
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,640
with these graphs

994
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,880
these if any of you are financial savvy

995
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,360
look exactly like stock market ticker

996
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,320
symbols or financial distribution curves

997
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,559
your cfo would recognize this

998
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,000
immediately

999
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,440
that's a huge advantage for you as a

1000
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
cyber security practitioner you're now

1001
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,760
taking your gut instinct which is good

1002
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,200
and you're actually putting numbers to

1003
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
that data again you're the expert you

1004
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
have the best amount of data to pull

1005
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,159
this together but if you come in and you

1006
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,080
say if we have no security controls

1007
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,159
here's our risk range and if we're able

1008
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,159
to implement some controls or more

1009
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
controls and reduce the risk by that

1010
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,600
amount they go cool i need to invest

1011
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,279
zero dollars for the top one and i'm

1012
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,519
totally pwned i can invest five million

1013
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,880
dollars for the second one or i can

1014
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,720
invest 500 million dollars and get the

1015
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,840
third one

1016
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,519
i can now make an educated decision as a

1017
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,519
business leader about my risk tolerance

1018
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,360
do i have zero risk tolerance and i need

1019
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
to invest that 50 million dollars what

1020
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,039
can i call it a day at 5 million go you

1021
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,640
know what firewall and mfa and a good

1022
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,320
patching program is all i need because

1023
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,919
that gets me pretty close to that third

1024
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,799
one

1025
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,640
that is a different conversation now

1026
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,240
you're talking about dollars and figures

1027
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,720
and quantitative amounts not just heat

1028
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,279
maps

1029
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,559
