1
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,359
yes I I welcome thanks for having us

2
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,640
here really excited to do this

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,380
presentation

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:22,980
um

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,980
and partly because it's our first big

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,920
one since being mask free and coming out

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,279
of covid and it's also my first

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,200
presentation since being kicked out of

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,700
Toastmasters so hopefully bear with me

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,860
um see if we can't get this done but we

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,899
have a ton of information to get to you

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,399
I I want to

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,680
we what our purpose for for doing this

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,160
is to provide you a high level overview

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,079
of what the FBI does because I know

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,960
there's a lot of myths about who we are

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
people think we're just a bunch of agent

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,260
Smiths you know running around stealing

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,739
stuff and hacking your network but we do

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,080
want to give just give you an idea of

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,119
you know what the bureau does what our

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,619
mission is what the cyber division

23
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,200
mission is and how it it trickles down

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,900
to the field offices and and how we uh

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,700
develop our strategy and how we

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,040
investigate uh cyber crimes

27
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,180
hey how you doing man amazing Johnson

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,000
this is Special Agent Johnson oh how you

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,759
doing no relation

30
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,920
I'm uh

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm Dwayne Robinson LAPD I'm in charge

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
here

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,658
not anymore

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,140
what movie

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,860
yeah so that that is not what we do we

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,200
don't come rolling in and take over an

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,899
investigation uh what we do do majority

38
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,460
of the time when you do call us and we

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,560
respond to a cyber incident uh we're

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
going to to reach out to our our state

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
Partners or other Federal Partners like

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,640
DHS and we're going to basically come up

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,680
with a incident response plan how do we

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,199
want to respond to to this uh this

45
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,879
incident and you know who do we need to

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,160
talk to so we're often rolling in

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,180
alongside uh State Police and uh and our

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,160
DHS partners

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,500
so if there's anything you take away

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,319
from from this presentation here are

51
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,599
these four things build relationships

52
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,780
today we're really here to provide you a

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,599
point of contact if you don't know you

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,239
know anybody in in the FBI or in

55
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,340
Richmond or if you're from another state

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,140
please reach out to the local field

57
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,300
office and establish a relationship and

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,400
the reason for that is because we we

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,379
want to make sure that you have a point

60
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,300
of contact so that if something does

61
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,540
occur or even if during the course of of

62
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,160
creating your incident response plan

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
that you know who to call and you can

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,580
work with us we can work with you to

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,500
help you develop that plan and hopefully

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,060
you know we'll be a part of that

67
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,620
um you know know your local FBI POC

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,260
that's why we're here today uh Mike and

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,480
I both you know have worked cyber crimes

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,300
for majority of I I'm at 14 years Mike

71
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,260
said 17 yeah 17. 17 years so we have a

72
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,340
wealth of knowledge that we could

73
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,840
provide you guys

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,940
um just having worked the these types of

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,180
cyber crimes for for all of our career

76
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,640
so have a plan one of the biggest issues

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,580
we have when we we walk into

78
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,540
a cyber incident is the lack of a plan

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,340
uh you know there are different roles

80
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,340
what roles does each individual have uh

81
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,220
when when a cyber incident occurs and

82
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,000
how are they mobilized to to help to

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,739
remediate the issue

84
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,239
um it Mike's kind of talk a little bit

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,239
about what we do when we come to when

86
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,640
we're invited to assist with a cyber

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,939
incident in a little bit but again you

88
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,819
know have a plan and plan for the worst

89
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,700
case scenario one of the

90
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,860
we multiple times we have state

91
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,680
governments we have hospitals that are

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,540
unable to treat patients have to turn

93
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,540
people away because they're hit with you

94
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,099
know the latest ransomware variant I

95
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,019
think it was University of Vermont was

96
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,600
hit at the peak of covet basically

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,358
and uh they had to take down our entire

98
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,160
network their medical their medical

99
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,360
records the medical treatment

100
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,820
applications were all down

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,220
and it was a result I I think it was

102
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,360
right

103
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,580
um had hit their networks they didn't

104
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,139
have any way to treat patients they had

105
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,300
to turn people away I think they lost a

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,820
total of 60 million dollars

107
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,600
um

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,020
and you know so yeah definitely have a

109
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,060
plan and plan for a worst case scenario

110
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,220
one of the biggest issues they had was I

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,259
think was a while the Chief Operating

112
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,720
Officer uh

113
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,060
had to spend a ton of time

114
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,240
trying to teach the doctors how to use

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,199
paper right records using paper

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,300
so you know what is what does your plan

117
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,460
look like if you were to lose access to

118
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,860
your your your applications your your

119
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,000
network

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
and Report cyber incidents report them

121
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,380
when they happen you know again why

122
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,479
we're here is that you have a POC you

123
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,539
know if you see something say something

124
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,060
uh and because the longer the the

125
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,940
infection is on your system the worse

126
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,160
it's going to get the more uh you know

127
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,020
people are going to start walking all

128
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,639
over the crime scene if you will

129
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,900
so yeah our mission is to protect the

130
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,520
American people

131
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,919
um and and defend the Constitution so

132
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,520
that's why I'm here I I was I spent 10

133
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,740
years as a Oracle systems admin prior to

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,400
joining the bureau and after multiple uh

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,740
layoffs I decided to apply to the bureau

136
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,100
and it I always had a passion and and

137
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,759
just a desire to to do the right thing

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,259
and I think that's what kind of led me

139
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,539
to to that aside from trying to avoid

140
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,919
layoffs

141
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:05,759
um

142
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,979
but yeah so as you can see our our

143
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,180
mission

144
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,479
cyber is two and three it uh you know

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,100
protect the us against foreign

146
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,020
intelligence Espionage and cyber

147
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,720
operations and a com combat significant

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,819
cyber criminal activity but when you

149
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,740
look at uh you know protect the US from

150
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,060
terrorist attack what does that look

151
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,220
like anymore is it really just somebody

152
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
you know flying a plane into the World

153
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,979
Trade Center

154
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,919
or is it a lot of the recruiting that

155
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,780
that's done online and in different

156
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,600
forms uh you know without us knowing

157
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,539
it's it's really all kind of becoming

158
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,759
somewhat muddled and people are using

159
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,580
you know computers as as a way to to

160
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,380
recruit and convert people

161
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
yeah

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,780
so cyber division's mission is to impose

163
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,460
risk and consequences on Cyber

164
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,699
adversaries we do that any number of

165
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,919
ways uh you know one of the things we

166
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,020
consider is you know

167
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,360
do we have enough evidence to to arrest

168
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,039
to indict

169
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,560
um there are other opportunities to try

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,259
to go after the infrastructure when it

171
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,120
comes to like ransomware it's extremely

172
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,199
difficult to identify actors over and

173
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,780
typically they're they're overseas so

174
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,759
you know we look to indictments we look

175
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,819
to publicly basically embarrass uh

176
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,460
embarrass them we do work with other

177
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,440
foreign governments and our legal at the

178
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,419
Shea's office which I'll touch in a bit

179
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,000
to try to impose those consequences to

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
extend our reach overseas

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,300
but we have the way that cyber Works in

182
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,280
general is we receive you know our

183
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,500
mission again is to protect and uphold

184
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,139
the Constitution from from uh the

185
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,900
Enterprise strategy and it trickles down

186
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,759
to cyber division strategy which has

187
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,680
five different uh sections we have uh

188
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,979
we have China Korea criminal Russia and

189
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,680
Iran those are our primary primary

190
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,500
threat and each of those sections come

191
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,960
up with a strategy as to how we want to

192
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,900
how we want to go about investigating

193
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,479
those countries and cyber crimes for

194
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,080
instance we have in criminal you know we

195
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,819
have business email compromises probably

196
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,160
one of our our largest threats you know

197
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,620
so we conduct investigations our goal is

198
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,319
to try to get to the very top of that

199
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,539
that scam if you will try to understand

200
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,820
everybody else that's working under them

201
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,799
so it just creates a big tree of

202
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,919
individuals who are responsible for

203
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,120
opening up bank accounts to receive

204
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,700
those proceeds and cash them out and you

205
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,500
know where are they sending money who's

206
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,660
receiving those funds so it's a matter

207
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,880
of trying to get to the top typically

208
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,100
following the money and and try to

209
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,440
conduct operations where we can identify

210
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,000
other individuals that are involved

211
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,680
so we'll receive our Authority

212
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,899
presidential policy directive 41

213
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,800
provides FBI the the primary role in

214
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,920
investigating significant cyber activity

215
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,620
we're the lead investigate investigators

216
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,100
and and cyber response you know we want

217
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,740
to investigate a tribute and prosecute

218
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,100
so DHS their lead Federal agency and

219
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,320
asset response activities primarily for

220
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,060
critical infrastructure

221
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,279
and then Odie and I is a federal Agency

222
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,560
for intelligent intelligence support if

223
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
you're wondering you know should you

224
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
share information with us where it's

225
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,959
going to go it's either going to be used

226
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,700
you know we could try to use it in a

227
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,220
criminal investigation to try to

228
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,140
attribute actors to a specific crime and

229
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,660
Lead toward prosecution or it can go

230
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,420
toward Intel a lot of you guys in this

231
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,640
room you know are part of maybe some

232
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,380
sort of threat intelligence company you

233
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,720
might run your own Intel company you see

234
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,459
you're seeing this stuff before we are

235
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,820
and so what we're hoping to do today is

236
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,560
you know hope you open a dialogue

237
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,600
between each other so that if you do see

238
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,700
something and you come to us and say you

239
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,920
know hey Mike hey Chris this is what

240
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,300
we're seeing and we can check our

241
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,000
Holdings see what's going on if it if

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,560
you know there's something happening we

243
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,540
can you know explore it further and see

244
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,899
how we can uh we'll talk about how we do

245
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,760
our reporting and how it gets out to the

246
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,740
private sector so you can Harden your

247
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,420
networks and hopefully prevent other

248
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,979
others from being victimized

249
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,959
so again here's our roles and

250
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,720
responsibilities again DHS is is

251
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,700
primarily responsible for asset

252
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,680
protection amongst critical

253
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,180
infrastructure

254
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,120
DOD NSA primarily protection of

255
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,519
infrastructure related to uh Military

256
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,760
Department of Defense and then doj FBI

257
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,920
is a criminal prosecution and

258
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,720
investigations of those crimes so we'll

259
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,180
work again we work in concert with which

260
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,579
each of those to investigate and protect

261
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,560
uh

262
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,239
against cyber crimes

263
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,740
so drilling down even further that's

264
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,660
that's headquarters and that that's uh

265
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,140
doj from a high level I want to just

266
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,640
talk about

267
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,560
what the FBI looks like from a field

268
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,600
office level we have 56 field offices

269
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,779
and 35 000 employees I believe a third

270
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,300
of that are special agents

271
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,040
um it's just about about 13 000 special

272
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,380
agents yeah so

273
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,839
but each each Squad each cyber squad has

274
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,660
special agents computer scientists data

275
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,459
analysts we have digital forensic

276
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,220
examiners uh Intel analysts and and

277
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,860
professional support my squad personally

278
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,019
we have only one cyber Squad in Richmond

279
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,339
we have seven agents uh two two uh Intel

280
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,680
analyst data analyst a computer

281
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,440
scientists and and support and so we

282
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
cover the the large part of 82 counties

283
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
in in the state uh wfo and North

284
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,620
Virginia resident agency covers I

285
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,139
believe four or five counties five

286
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,579
counties in Northern Virginia and then

287
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,760
Norfolk has its own piece of of

288
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,839
Virginia as well

289
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,399
so might you want to talk about task

290
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,079
force

291
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,060
so a big way in which we accomplish our

292
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,100
mission is by building a task force

293
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,139
right we don't function in a bubble by

294
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,959
ourselves yes we're a large agency but

295
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,480
there's roughly uh the way it's kind of

296
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,220
put together is roughly one special

297
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,800
agent for every 100 000 U.S citizens so

298
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,360
there's not a lot of us we need to

299
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,459
leverage local assets or other Federal

300
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,579
Partners State Partners to work these

301
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,800
investigations and especially cyber

302
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,480
right cyber is borderless right that

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,339
when we have a victim in Hanover County

304
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,200
that gets hit with a business email

305
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
compromise or Elder scam the person

306
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,120
conducting that fraud is probably

307
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,339
somewhere overseas so the Hanover County

308
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,740
Sheriff's Office would be hard-pressed

309
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,360
to pursue them but by having

310
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,880
relationships with us we can train them

311
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
we can give them access to those assets

312
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,560
to be able to do things uh that they

313
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,639
traditionally couldn't do as a

314
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,200
department themselves and we're also

315
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,720
getting a Manpower bump up because now

316
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,459
we have local partners that we can train

317
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,040
to help accomplish that mission so we do

318
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,139
the training we provide them equipment

319
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,000
uh some of them sit in our workspace

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,800
full-time some of them just come

321
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,120
occasionally when they need to and work

322
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,800
out of their home departments but it's a

323
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,740
way for us to really share knowledge and

324
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,779
be a force multiplier in targeting

325
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,160
cybercrime

326
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,519
as far as International presence

327
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,800
probably 25 30 years ago when Louis free

328
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,079
was the FBI director he realized back in

329
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
the 90s that we needed a presence

330
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,160
overseas so we started establishing

331
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,320
agents in embassies throughout the world

332
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,139
so I think we have uh 63 International

333
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,300
offices or League ads so those are

334
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,279
agents sometimes multiple agents that

335
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,779
sit in those embassies especially the

336
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,000
larger ones and build relationships with

337
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,160
our local Partners there and that's

338
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,920
integral to cyber cases it pays huge

339
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,079
dividends when we have a command and

340
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,360
control server pop up in Bulgaria I can

341
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,579
reach out to our guy on the embassy and

342
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,260
I've had instances where a week later I

343
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,180
get a FedEx envelope and it's an image

344
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,680
of that command and control server

345
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
because they've been able to go out and

346
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,740
get that for us so those Partnerships

347
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,040
overseas are huge in cyber cases

348
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,139
next thing we've got is the Cyber action

349
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,380
team so back in 2006 uh the FBI realized

350
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,120
hey we've got all this great expertise

351
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,180
on Cyber squads all over the country and

352
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,100
we're having a lot more major cyber

353
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,720
incidents taking place within

354
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,240
organizations we need almost like a SWAT

355
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,339
team that can go in of specialized

356
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,100
individuals that can do that deep level

357
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,620
dive that differ work on networks and

358
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,420
computer systems to find out how an

359
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,579
intrusion occurred what data was

360
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,740
breached and compromised and x-filled

361
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,600
out of the network so the Cyber action

362
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
team or cat for short was created it's

363
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,079
made up of 65 agents and computer

364
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,079
scientists from cyber squads throughout

365
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,600
the FBI field offices as well as cyber

366
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,160
division headquarters

367
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,440
so I'm part of the team

368
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,360
um you know we're on call twice a year

369
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,980
we get sent out sometimes we have major

370
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,079
instances we have have multiple teams

371
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,880
going out uh solar winds was a good

372
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,320
example I think we had eight teams out

373
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,060
at one time at a bunch of different

374
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,579
locations so it's a way for us to Surge

375
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,040
very specialized expertise out to victim

376
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,860
locations bring equipment in work with

377
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,600
those organizations to figure out what

378
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,160
happened and the extent of the data

379
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,000
breach

380
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,540
so Mike so one of the the benefits of

381
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,160
having like a cyber action team

382
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,440
deployment is that you know a lot of

383
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,899
these guys have experienced multiple

384
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,420
cyber incidents and they're very

385
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,980
familiar with the types of indicators

386
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,139
that they can start pointing uh your

387
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,139
remediation team at so it would be you

388
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,540
know help with directing you as to you

389
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,500
know you might want to look in this

390
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,720
location this is what where we we see a

391
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,459
lot right yeah we've got a lot of

392
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:51,720
specialized access to uh iocs Yara rules

393
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,160
things like that that we can quickly

394
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,740
Deploy on a victim's Network to identify

395
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,240
something that they may not even have a

396
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,459
clue as to where the initial point of

397
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,259
compromise was and who might have done

398
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,959
it so it's a huge benefit to be able to

399
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,519
quickly get an understanding of what's

400
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,779
going on

401
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,079
so when we talk about cyber crime or

402
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,500
cyber uh computer intrusions you know

403
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,060
I put this graphic up there this is

404
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,199
something we typically use for more

405
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,180
General audiences but you know it kind

406
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,980
of gives you the types of different

407
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,480
actors that are doing things out there

408
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,160
some of them it's purely for social

409
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,399
concerns like Anonymous uh and the LOL

410
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,320
set guys a few years ago we have the

411
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,899
typical criminals insiders you know

412
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,060
people can fall into buckets but the big

413
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,320
important thing for us I always like to

414
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,060
point out is people don't stay in these

415
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,199
buckets right especially the

416
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,820
nation-state actors right we see a lot

417
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,560
of these guys that get extensive

418
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,920
training capabilities access to tools

419
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,240
development things like that and they're

420
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,240
using it to do state-sponsored work and

421
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,459
their employers don't seem to care if

422
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,899
they Moonlight on the side and maybe

423
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,579
they're engaging in ransomware or

424
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,740
carting activities or other things so

425
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,940
they're taking those skills and

426
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,800
capabilities that they get to do one

427
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,300
thing and they're leveraging it to use

428
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,940
in another area

429
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,919
sort of the data breach report from last

430
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,079
year still the primary motivation for

431
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,059
computer intrusions on to networks

432
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,439
computer systems is of course Financial

433
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,400
people want to make money

434
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,319
so people probably don't realize it but

435
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,539
half the FBI's mission is National

436
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,059
Security well that one goes forward too

437
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,220
uh so I'm going to first talk about

438
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,539
criminal stuff Chris is going to talk

439
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:25,500
about some of the national security

440
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,199
stuff uh in the past decade or so we've

441
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,820
started to kind of blend a lot more

442
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,380
especially as we're seeing like I said

443
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,360
people that are doing nation state stuff

444
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
that are also doing uh criminal work uh

445
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,740
we're seeing Crossing and streams

446
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,780
sometimes we'll see in the AP same apt

447
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,460
group that's doing both National

448
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,380
Security work for their country as well

449
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,360
as criminal stuff let's talk about some

450
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,100
of the cyber crime stuff that we see

451
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,080
obviously Chris mentioned at business

452
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,760
email compromise that's one here in the

453
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,200
Richmond office that we work a lot of

454
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
we've got several major investigations

455
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,760
targeting uh a couple of african-based

456
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,880
crime groups doing this Bec is a huge

457
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,380
problem the new numbers that just came

458
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,840
out last month 43 billion dollars

459
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,880
reported since 2013 and that's just

460
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,679
what's been reported you can see the

461
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,539
breakdown between the years it's

462
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,220
increasing covid for whatever reason

463
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,080
caused a huge Spike and I think a lot of

464
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,000
it was due to PPP P loans fake

465
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,700
unemployment claims but the BEC numbers

466
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,179
really spiked every State's affected 177

467
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,860
countries it's pretty rampant

468
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,640
I put this slide here to talk about

469
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,900
because everybody in this room probably

470
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,520
knows what business email compromise is

471
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
they know how they're perpetrated uh

472
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,140
spoofed emails sometimes it's probably

473
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,580
about 10 percent of the cases we're

474
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,400
seeing are actual sophisticated actors

475
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,380
using computer intrusion to get into

476
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,200
either a victims Network or one of their

477
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
vendors and then sending an email to the

478
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
victim using the legitimate vendor's

479
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,799
account but most of these are socially

480
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,140
engineered but these groups are still

481
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,720
sophisticated right this is not one two

482
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,120
three actors they're a business or an

483
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,679
organization just like a lot of the

484
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,360
companies and organizations you guys

485
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,740
work for right they're separation of

486
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,179
Duties with inside the organization

487
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,299
there's people who get infrastructure

488
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,940
hosting vpns registering spoof domains

489
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,980
you have money mule Wranglers who are

490
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,140
recruiting people off uh romance scams

491
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,539
work from home scams to be able to get

492
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,400
bank accounts to move that money and

493
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,780
then you have these guys that are

494
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,059
obtaining the target information this is

495
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,140
not something where they're just

496
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,760
shooting in the dark and hoping to get

497
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,220
lucky these guys do their research and

498
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,660
here's I just want to put some examples

499
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,039
up of some of the things that we're

500
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
seeing these guys use to get this

501
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,940
information some of the biggest ones

502
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,039
that I've seen recently are open data

503
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,080
portals that a lot of state county and

504
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,600
local governments use to provide

505
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,360
transparency the taxpayers right they

506
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,880
want to show how their constituents

507
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,620
money is being spent they publish all

508
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,000
this information out there some of them

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,640
are super detailed and you can sort and

510
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,580
quickly see hey who's providing I.T

511
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,200
infrastructure and services and let's

512
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,000
sort it by who gets paid when and how

513
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,880
much is being spent we also see

514
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,539
uh construction company uh is a huge

515
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,700
huge sector to be targeted because

516
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,380
there's so much money involved right if

517
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,820
you're talking about universities or

518
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,919
hospitals they're spending tens of

519
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,240
millions of dollars to build these

520
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,340
massive facilities and buildings they're

521
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,919
super juicy targets so here in the U.S

522
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,120
we've identified through our

523
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,700
investigations about five data

524
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,100
aggregators that collect information on

525
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,140
construction projects and there's a

526
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,640
legitimate purpose for that if you're a

527
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
construction company you want to know

528
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
hey in the Mid-Atlantic region where I'm

529
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
located I want to build stuff what

530
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
projects are coming up for bid that I

531
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,740
can put in for

532
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,480
you can pay to subscribe to these

533
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,100
Services they're pretty expensive the

534
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,020
more you search the more you pay

535
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,299
uh but that's a legitimate purpose but

536
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,039
we found often there's not much of a

537
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,960
know your customer type thing that Banks

538
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,299
do for these aggregator Services if you

539
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,799
have an email account and a credit card

540
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,059
that works they're going to give you

541
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,460
access typically so we've seen a couple

542
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,919
of our investigations where these guys

543
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,919
the the BEC actors are paying for these

544
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,720
services and they're going in and

545
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,600
searching across the entire U.S and one

546
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,360
of the cases that we uh are working now

547
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,520
we were able to remotely search the bad

548
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,799
actor's computer and what we found was

549
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,280
them using a cloud-based spreadsheet to

550
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,440
share information we've also found

551
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,360
information that they had subscribed to

552
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,220
one of these services in between two

553
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,840
accounts they'd spent over forty

554
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,460
thousand dollars paying for this

555
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,620
aggregation service they built a

556
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,480
spreadsheet that had 30 different tabs

557
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,340
across of it breaking out Target

558
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,620
information included the construction

559
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,799
project uh location who the principal

560
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,980
points of contact were their names phone

561
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,720
numbers facts it included who the

562
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,159
construction company that got awarded

563
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,960
the job the controller at that

564
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,059
construction company people and accounts

565
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,880
payable contact information start and

566
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,320
stop dates of the project the

567
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,080
approximate value of the project and the

568
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,760
tabs were clearly being given to

569
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,100
different teams of actors to go after so

570
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,780
that they didn't cross streams that some

571
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,000
of the tabs even had suggested spoof

572
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,539
domains to register as far as to conduct

573
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,900
the campaign there was over 1700 Targets

574
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,820
on that spreadsheet and the approximate

575
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,740
value if they would have successfully

576
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,960
gotten all of those was about 350

577
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,480
million dollars so these guys do their

578
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,559
homework they're getting this

579
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,059
information and they're leveraging it to

580
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,460
build these campaigns

581
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,080
some of the stuff we recommend to try

582
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,940
and stop BEC stuff is the traditional

583
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,100
stuff that we're pushing right uh

584
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,320
two-factor authentication specifically

585
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,659
obviously I prefer the hardware uh you

586
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,700
see Google cloudflare spoke here last

587
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,200
year and talked about how successful it

588
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,419
had been in their networks for uh

589
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,059
stopping all intrusions but we also

590
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,539
pushing two-factor in another sense for

591
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,179
these business email compromises the

592
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,280
primary Targets on the large business

593
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,220
ones are the accounts payable teams yes

594
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,500
are we seeing some intrusion activity I

595
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,360
would say maybe 10 of the cases that

596
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,120
come across my desk are an actual

597
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,500
intrusion most of it's social

598
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,880
engineering so they're not getting

599
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,260
credentials

600
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,940
but where the accounts payable

601
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,919
departments are failing is they're not

602
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,740
implementing good procedures no matter

603
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,780
how the the change request comes in

604
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,480
they're not doing anything what they

605
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,159
should be doing to verify so we've been

606
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,840
pushing two-factor on them meaning that

607
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,299
you had two layers of people who look at

608
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,280
this and approve it and whatever pain

609
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,080
threshold is set for hey we're willing

610
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,340
to lose Maybe

611
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,320
anything over fifty thousand dollars

612
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,840
we're going to call and verify or

613
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,299
require this two Factor where two layers

614
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,679
of management have to look through it

615
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,480
and approve it but the bottom line is

616
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,919
we're pushing people and accounts

617
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,200
payable pick up the phone call a

618
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,360
pre-established number at that vendor

619
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,659
and verify that the change is legit and

620
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,400
you know we're pushing them to not give

621
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,960
information right don't call up and give

622
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,179
out the invoice number and the new

623
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,799
account information make that vendor

624
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,480
verify it and provide all that stuff to

625
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,600
you

626
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,100
so some of the things that we've been

627
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,500
doing uh to take down these groups like

628
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,140
Chris said you know the the thing that

629
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,940
the FBI is supposed to do and do well is

630
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,559
not one-offs we're not just hooking guys

631
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
up on the corner that are doing things

632
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,460
we do Enterprise investigations we

633
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,740
identify entire networks individuals and

634
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,480
we look to do takedowns

635
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,400
so for the past couple years covet

636
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,860
obviously slowed things down but we've

637
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,900
been doing coordinated campaigns usually

638
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,340
by the end of each summer we've been

639
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,080
announcing it where we're taking down

640
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,260
multiple actors throughout the world

641
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,500
here in the U.S overseas wherever they

642
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,020
happen to be and we're trying to break

643
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,260
these networks uh in large batches and

644
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,900
not grabbing just one-offs

645
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,279
the next thing I want to talk about was

646
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,200
ransomware right ransomware is the big

647
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,480
sexy thing that everybody uh talks about

648
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,340
in the news the numbers are still

649
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,200
dwarfed by business email compromise

650
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,360
right as devastating as ransomware can

651
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,299
be to an organization BEC financially is

652
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,220
still by far the bigger hit but

653
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,320
ransomware is obviously a huge problem

654
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,380
and we're working hard to address it

655
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,400
obviously we're getting lots of

656
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,380
complaints honestly those numbers I

657
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,840
think are ridiculously low a lot of this

658
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,279
doesn't get reported I can't tell you

659
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,080
how many times I find out after the fact

660
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,880
that a company got hit with ransomware

661
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,860
six months a year ago and they just

662
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,120
didn't report it they just either paid

663
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,179
the ransom or uh stood up their Network

664
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,919
again

665
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,279
but last summer Colonial pipeline was a

666
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,720
huge one right because it started

667
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,159
affecting everybody not just an

668
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,480
individual organization or local

669
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,140
community or a county or city or uh it

670
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,340
actually was affecting everybody because

671
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,620
gas prices went up we know how that gets

672
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,299
headlines if it starts affecting

673
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,279
everybody's wallet the Department of

674
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,740
Justice finally decided you know what

675
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,600
ransomware has risen to a higher level

676
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,919
of threat we're going to treat it like

677
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,539
terrorism we're going to give the FBI

678
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,820
and other parts of the U.S government

679
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,820
more resources and authorities to Target

680
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,900
this

681
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,940
so this is one of the first times we

682
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,279
were able to really take a big bite out

683
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,980
of a ransomware incident of the our evil

684
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,200
group Colonial did pay the approximately

685
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,539
five million dollars in Ransom we were

686
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,120
able to identify the wallet keys and

687
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,640
pull that money back and our DOD

688
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,679
partners cybercom

689
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
uh NSA were able to take action on the

690
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,600
infrastructure and actually take down

691
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,659
the whole our evil infrastructure

692
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,940
and that jumps to Partnerships

693
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,799
again just like we talked about with the

694
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,260
task force our interagency Partnerships

695
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,140
are critical uh not only here in the U.S

696
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,240
with all the different agencies that we

697
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,460
like to work with and have need to work

698
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,440
with but also what we call our five Eye

699
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,340
Partners the US UK Canada Australia and

700
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,140
New Zealand we share information tightly

701
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,320
with them uh work closely with them on a

702
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,840
lot of cases and then we have the ncfta

703
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,520
which is based up in Pittsburgh with a

704
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,440
couple of LA and New York locations too

705
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,360
I think but that's the national cyber

706
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,640
forensic and training Alliance it's a

707
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,799
non-profit we bring a lot of folks in

708
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,600
we're just one member there a lot of

709
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,980
these agencies up here have people that

710
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,840
sit there but we have most of the major

711
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,360
Banks Visa Mastercard Target just a

712
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,400
bunch of entities that we work to show

713
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,539
share Intel with on criminal uh fraud

714
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,840
cases and intrusion cases

715
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,059
so what is the FBI doing right that's

716
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,320
what everybody always asks what are you

717
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,880
guys doing besides just taking

718
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,340
information not telling us anything so

719
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,899
uh

720
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,279
we're trying to be better about

721
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,260
marketing ourselves and putting out

722
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,580
there obviously

723
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,899
because of the sensitivity

724
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:27,539
investigations uh grand jury things like

725
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,159
that we can't just put everything out

726
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,659
there right we have to control some

727
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,520
information we also don't want to shame

728
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,380
victims right we don't want to out

729
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,580
people that don't want their information

730
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,279
out there but we do try and share as

731
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,799
much as we can about our successes and

732
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,720
what we're doing so a good example is

733
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,059
the iMat takedown last year our Raleigh

734
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,779
FBI office was integral in this actually

735
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,760
an Intel analyst on our Squad now was in

736
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,620
the Raleigh office a huge part of this

737
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,299
investigation he actually went over to

738
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,760
Ukraine and was part of the search and

739
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,799
arrest that took place over there

740
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,960
some of the images that got published by

741
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
the ukrainians of cash and drugs and

742
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,399
high-end computer equipment that they

743
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,178
were seizing right

744
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,179
but again this comes down to this is not

745
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,100
something the FBI is doing alone right

746
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,960
we're working with foreign governments

747
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,600
with europol all these Partners to do

748
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,340
this and it's not just other government

749
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,080
agencies and law enforcement agencies

750
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,299
it's private sector Partners too like

751
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,640
you guys right Microsoft has been a huge

752
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,140
partner they've done a lot of civil

753
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,120
forfeiture work to take down and seize

754
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,179
domains and infrastructure so we have to

755
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,880
work with everybody who has a stake in

756
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,440
this and you know the internet

757
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,299
especially here in the US the vast

758
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,460
majority of the infrastructure and

759
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,200
networks is owned by the private sector

760
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,899
so we rely heavily on those Partnerships

761
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,520
and the willingness of this private

762
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
parties to work with us and share

763
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,120
information so that we can do these

764
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,620
investigations and look to take this

765
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,059
stuff down because we have authorities

766
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,880
and capabilities that those individual

767
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,340
organizations together don't have

768
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,520
so things that we try and do

769
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,960
indictments arrests you know a lot of

770
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,820
the folks we look for in cyber crime

771
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,039
maybe they're in Russia or China or

772
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,200
North Korea or other places that the

773
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,700
question comes up why are you doing an

774
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,899
indictment you're never going to get

775
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:15,659
these guys sometimes that's true but

776
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,220
that may make their life very difficult

777
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,840
if you look at somebody say living in

778
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,059
Iran if you're doing indictment on that

779
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,279
person they're now not able to travel

780
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,140
out of Iran they're stuck in a country

781
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,820
that's been crushed with sanctions that

782
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,580
has limited economic opportunities their

783
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,620
hopes of potentially leaving getting an

784
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,779
education in the U.S or in Europe they

785
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,220
all want to work for Facebook or Google

786
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,799
or companies like yours right that just

787
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,120
went out the door because those

788
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,679
indictments don't go away they're out

789
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,120
there forever we're always going to keep

790
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,159
looking for that person so also we hope

791
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,600
that that percolates out and maybe the

792
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,100
next group of guys is going to say you

793
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,539
know maybe I don't want to do that I

794
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:49,620
don't want to get caught in this because

795
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,140
I don't want to ruin my chances the

796
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,520
other thing is people like to travel

797
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,140
right they like to go to the beach they

798
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,120
like to go to Disney World and we're

799
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,220
good at catching people when they travel

800
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,480
because a lot of times we'll indict

801
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,039
people and we won't say any thing about

802
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,960
it until they travel somewhere and then

803
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,220
we'll grab them up because they'll

804
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,260
Transit through some place that we can

805
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,059
get a hold of them to a extradition

806
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,000
treaty we're also doing seizures uh

807
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,620
economic sanctions through the office of

808
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,659
foreign asset control State departments

809
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,279
jumped on recently in the past year

810
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,260
doing rewards for justice you're going

811
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,399
to see some of that and what Chris is

812
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,600
talking about

813
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,360
and then some examples Again emotech Sam

814
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,880
Sam ransomware

815
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
we're also targeting criminal ecosystems

816
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,679
we're regularly investigating and

817
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,299
seizing and taking down these places

818
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,860
that these criminals try and do business

819
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,200
share information and sell stolen data

820
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
some good examples just from the past

821
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,279
month or two is raid forums and the uh

822
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,799
SSN dob site that was just seized a week

823
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,020
or two ago so those are vast Treasure

824
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,700
troes of information of not just taking

825
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,740
the site down but all the people that

826
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,520
were using them too

827
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,740
we put this thing out again I'm not

828
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,880
gonna go to this line by line because

829
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,080
this is a lot of the stuff that you guys

830
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,519
already know but this is the type of

831
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,080
information that when we're reaching out

832
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,480
to organizations and telling them these

833
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,620
are the types of things that we

834
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,600
recommend you do to protect yourself

835
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,299
from ransomware all the normal typical

836
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,039
stuff that all of us preach out there

837
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,299
all the time but I just wanted to share

838
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,860
that kind of give you guys an idea of

839
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,240
the types of information that we're

840
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,720
pushing out

841
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,019
thank you so yeah we just want to talk

842
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,940
about I think we only have a couple of

843
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,260
slides left but we just want to talk

844
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,200
about you know some of the the uh

845
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,059
successes that we've had working with

846
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,460
foreign Partners on some of these uh

847
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,220
these cases here these two guys were

848
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,940
recently indicted for their election

849
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,159
interference they were actively

850
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,039
targeting uh constituents sending out

851
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,559
threatening emails

852
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,820
threatening harm if they voted for a

853
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,740
certain candidate they were also trying

854
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,399
to access local election facilities to

855
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,700
to try and manipulate balloting data so

856
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,960
you know one of the things we did we

857
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,519
went out and embarrassed them for for

858
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,519
Iran again like Mike said indicting

859
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,279
these guys kind of limits their their

860
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,440
ability to travel

861
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,620
um and if they do typically we'll see

862
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,880
them traveling to a friendly country

863
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,740
that we have an extradition treaty with

864
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,080
so you know part of the the legal ads at

865
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,960
Shay's job is to Foster or facilitate

866
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,240
relationship ships with the the

867
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,600
country's local law enforcement so you

868
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,640
know through Interpol we send out a red

869
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,399
notice should these individuals travel

870
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,159
to you know foreign country to uh let's

871
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,140
say like UK or something like that uh

872
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,320
Interpol will will flag it and let us

873
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,600
know and they're able to arrest and then

874
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,940
we work with them toward extradition so

875
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,100
these individuals will not be leaving

876
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,139
Iran anytime soon most likely

877
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,320
so the these are the Russian fsp guys I

878
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,740
think in March March 2022 we recently

879
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,419
indicted These Guys these were these

880
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,220
guys were responsible for hacking a

881
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,500
nuclear facility I'm pretty sure it was

882
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,720
their I.T Network the good thing was I

883
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,539
think the OT was air gap so they were

884
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,580
able to to preserve that um but yeah

885
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,919
these guys were responsible primarily

886
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,880
for compromising uh that Network

887
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,500
um again they're in Russia so they're

888
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,120
going to be extremely limited depending

889
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,460
on where you know where they travel

890
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,159
um the one thing with with Russia is

891
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,500
they're they're very much about the the

892
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,659
snatch and grab as opposed to the long

893
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:28,559
term

894
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,880
um I should I should shouldn't say that

895
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,559
they're they're both long-term and

896
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,600
snatch and grab they they kind of look

897
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,519
for the CR the crime of opportunity if

898
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,260
they have an opportunity they're going

899
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,820
to try and x-fill as much as they can

900
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,220
sell it online try and make some money

901
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,340
but also position themselves for a more

902
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,919
long-term effect and we believe that's

903
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,299
what they were planning on doing with

904
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,320
the nuclear facility

905
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,279
uh these these I think it was apt-41

906
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,820
there's two sets here I think apt-41 and

907
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,059
okay so yeah apt-41 these guys were

908
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,820
primarily responsible for compromising

909
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,639
multiple uh

910
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,000
multiple gaming and saw gaming software

911
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,560
and development companies stealing

912
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,079
intellectual property

913
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,020
um and uh so he indicted these guys and

914
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,480
then apt-40

915
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,219
these guys are responsible for

916
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,000
compromising several uh State networks

917
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,179
State and County networks so we were

918
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,820
able to indict those again China is very

919
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,980
much interested in intellectual property

920
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,020
things that they can take that would

921
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,239
basically provide them an economic

922
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,239
Advantage so they're they're very much a

923
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,819
snatch and grab kind of state

924
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,899
so how to get help again we're here to

925
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,960
be your your local point of contact

926
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,520
there's different ways to report cyber

927
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,079
incidents but now that we're in a room

928
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,480
and in front of you please reach out to

929
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,520
us Chris and Mike just reach out to our

930
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,099
local field office and ask for us

931
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,660
um we'd be happy to discuss what you're

932
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,520
seeing you know again you guys are often

933
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,579
in front of this and seeing things as as

934
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,760
their their uh they're occurring or even

935
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,380
um way in advance

936
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,240
um so like I said we have an issue with

937
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,300
being proactive uh with the bureau we're

938
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,700
often reacting to to different types of

939
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,619
cyber crimes I'd rather get out in front

940
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,720
of it have a discussion with you open up

941
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,700
lines of communication so you can give

942
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,140
us a call and say this is what we're

943
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,119
seeing you know and we can at least

944
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,160
respond back or at least open up a

945
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,660
two-way line of communication with you

946
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,380
to further address the issue

947
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,820
ic3.gov is our

948
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,280
basically 24-hour internet crime

949
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,900
complaint center

950
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,000
all of the complaints that that you

951
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,760
would file it through ic3 will end up

952
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,820
being sent to FBI Richmond if it's in

953
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,180
our area of responsibility aor and would

954
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,740
be signed out to an agent to take a look

955
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,359
at a lot of people ask like you know

956
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,640
what's your threshold you know if it's

957
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,520
what's the monetary threshold typically

958
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,220
for a large field office like New York

959
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,040
New York won't typically won't open up

960
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,420
an investigation unless it's over a

961
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,180
million dollars for FBI Richmond it

962
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,859
really depends we have a really

963
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,619
aggressive U.S attorney's office that

964
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,540
would open up an investigation on most

965
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,300
things but if you're looking at like a

966
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,800
monetary value probably around 200 300

967
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,720
000 but I'll say this even if we're not

968
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,880
going to open a case you know I always

969
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,320
tell people look if you're been the

970
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,520
victim especially of a business email

971
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,680
compromise call us right away because

972
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,599
the quicker you call us the better

973
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,160
chance that we can get your money back I

974
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,960
may not be able to open investigation or

975
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,940
not pursue it right at that moment but

976
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,079
I'm certainly going to do everything I

977
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,280
can to pick up the phone I'm going to

978
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,020
call contact at the bank that the money

979
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,940
went to and do everything I can to at

980
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,440
least get the money Frozen and return

981
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,839
back to the victim yeah for a business

982
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,760
email compromise the the amount doesn't

983
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,520
matter yeah call us because usually

984
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,680
within 24 hours there's a good

985
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,359
opportunity that we can get those funds

986
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,800
Frozen and they can work with your bank

987
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,880
to reverse the train transaction

988
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,160
so uh yeah so we have the asset recovery

989
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,560
team that does just that I believe it's

990
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,660
called up Wellspring they they're

991
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,960
they're notified by I think transactions

992
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,640
are Swift or something like that that uh

993
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,800
yeah and they also monitor ic3

994
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,780
complaints so when you file one and it's

995
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,520
marked as a business email compromise it

996
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,680
goes to the recovery asset team they

997
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,660
will proactively a couple years ago they

998
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,280
started doing this before they would

999
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,960
simply pass a lead to the field office

1000
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,220
and say Hey you might want to take a

1001
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,740
look at this well we get inundated with

1002
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,660
leads it may not pop up to the top right

1003
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,520
away because it was no way to like Mark

1004
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,200
it with the priority but now these guys

1005
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,820
a couple years ago said hey we need to

1006
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,200
be more proactive so they have a whole

1007
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,579
team of folks that watch for the stuff

1008
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,619
to come in when it does they immediately

1009
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,240
start calling the banks and trying to

1010
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,400
get the funds Frozen and reaching out to

1011
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,440
the field offices to let them know hey

1012
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,599
this is happening so their success rates

1013
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,859
been great if they've been notified

1014
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:00,119
within 72 hours of a BEC occurring

1015
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,040
they've got about 85 percent success

1016
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,740
rate of getting the money recalled so

1017
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,339
you know when I say you know 200 000 uh

1018
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,740
limit or uh threshold

1019
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,960
think about it as you know you're you

1020
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,140
may be one in a number of victims you

1021
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,640
know you may have lost twenty thousand

1022
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,740
dollars but there's probably 30 40 other

1023
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,660
victims that have all been compromised

1024
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,820
by the same group like Mike mentioned

1025
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,320
there's there's multiple individuals

1026
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,839
there's businesses in Africa that are

1027
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,820
that are that are conducting business

1028
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,280
email compromise scams and it's an

1029
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,619
entire groups of people that are

1030
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,060
aggregating this information and

1031
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,740
targeting victims overseas

1032
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,220
so yeah we're just talking about the the

1033
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,780
uh the kill chain the financial kill

1034
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,700
chain process

1035
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,560
um again within seven two hours by say

1036
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,780
24 hours because typically there's a

1037
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,839
money mule waiting to be notified that

1038
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,420
the money's waiting for it to be uh to

1039
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,520
be cashed out and and typically what

1040
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,200
they do is they'll cash it out and then

1041
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,240
wire it overseas or they'll send a gift

1042
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,980
card or whatever

1043
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,380
um and most of times it's typically

1044
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,480
unwitting individuals they're usually

1045
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,900
tricked into uh tricked into providing

1046
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,220
their bank account to an individual

1047
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,500
through like a romance scam a work from

1048
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,040
home scam they're often you know it's uh

1049
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,359
basically a Social Engineering Process

1050
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,280
do you need a subpoena before providing

1051
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
information no you don't typically if if

1052
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,460
you are a victim of a crime and you know

1053
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,520
you it's your company you can you could

1054
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,240
volunteer to uh what happened here

1055
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,680
you could basically provide us

1056
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,780
information consent to providing

1057
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,420
information as a victim you know if need

1058
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,000
be you can call us we can you know if if

1059
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,720
you feel spoken with legal uh it's and

1060
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
you feel it's feasible to give it to us

1061
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,079
and then you can provide it to us we can

1062
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,700
always follow it up with subpoena if

1063
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,380
need be

1064
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,680
um but what I would say to you before an

1065
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,480
incident occurs

1066
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,520
make sure you talk to your legal teams

1067
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,819
to to basically decide what you would be

1068
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:13,319
willing to give to a law enforcement

1069
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,359
partner in the event of a cyber incident

1070
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,180
a lot of the like I said The more time

1071
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,640
that that goes on that we're waiting to

1072
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,220
receive information uh the more issued

1073
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,020
there would be with you know basically

1074
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,960
treading on on the uh the crime scene so

1075
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,180
the vast majority of our engagement with

1076
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,400
the victim is consent right that's what

1077
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,480
we're functioning on we're not getting

1078
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,280
search warrants to come into a victim

1079
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,780
and see servers that's not how we

1080
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,460
operate right so that means it's

1081
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,319
incumbent upon the organizations to look

1082
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,359
at your usage policies your I.T user

1083
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,700
agreements and the banner warnings for

1084
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,440
employees right you need to work with

1085
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,060
your legal teams to make sure that

1086
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,220
there's clear statements out there that

1087
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,380
there's no reasonable expectation of

1088
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,780
privacy on company networks and devices

1089
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,480
that the users are employees and that

1090
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,640
information may be looked at in totality

1091
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,680
by the company and can also be shared

1092
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,180
with law enforcement if deemed

1093
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,700
appropriate and necessary but like I

1094
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,319
said we're functioning on Cent but that

1095
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,640
means you guys have to have things in

1096
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,079
place because if you don't have that

1097
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,119
stuff and we come in and there's 10

1098
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,980
workstations for different employees

1099
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,480
that we think might have been popped

1100
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,700
we're going to have to get legal process

1101
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,380
because those employees have a

1102
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,180
reasonable expectation of privacy unless

1103
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,220
they have otherwise agreed through the

1104
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,319
usage agreement that that's not the case

1105
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,319
yeah we had an issue a couple years ago

1106
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,359
I think the company was a victim of

1107
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,400
business email compromise and they had

1108
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,260
they wanted to wait to talk to the legal

1109
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,300
team before they provided us the account

1110
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,160
information that was affected so by the

1111
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,680
time we actually got to contacting the

1112
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,260
bank to try and freeze those funds the

1113
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,160
money was already gone

1114
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,700
so you know and pledge to pursue our

1115
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,800
mission you know hold those responsible

1116
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,339
uh who are victimizing and and targeting

1117
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,560
you as individuals and your companies

1118
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,240
what types of information that we want

1119
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,400
right here it is you know log files

1120
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,680
again it's typically we like to work by

1121
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,119
by consent

1122
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,040
um and if need be we can always get a

1123
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,660
subpoena or a search warrant for for

1124
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,180
those uh those items so this stuff's

1125
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,980
important though because you know this

1126
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,060
is not something we're going to come in

1127
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,220
and just like the video clip like uh

1128
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,540
we're in charge here get out of your

1129
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,980
server room we're just gonna tap in and

1130
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,359
take everything that's not how it works

1131
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,400
right we're gonna especially as the cat

1132
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,720
team we're going to want to come in and

1133
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,280
work with you guys talk with your I.T

1134
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,980
staff understand your environment uh

1135
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,780
start figuring out what looks like it's

1136
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,460
been affected and start figuring out

1137
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,020
what we need to collect can we get away

1138
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,000
with just memory stuff and triage

1139
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,339
because it looks like Viola smallware if

1140
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,900
it's a ransomware case I don't need to

1141
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,940
image terabytes worth of encrypted data

1142
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,740
right that's not valuable to the

1143
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,480
investigation but we need to work

1144
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,640
closely with your it folks and your

1145
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,140
legal folks to understand your

1146
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,880
environment and what we want to collect

1147
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,500
and we want to be transparent in about

1148
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,300
how and what we're going to do right

1149
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,680
we're working with you it's not a black

1150
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,119
box thing where we're going to go in and

1151
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,920
do stuff without explaining

1152
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,200
so I had a victim notification a couple

1153
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,640
weeks ago as far as like Network

1154
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,680
diagrams I walked into the director of

1155
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,260
it and I asked them you know if this

1156
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,240
threat had actually infected your

1157
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
network what are we looking at you know

1158
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,040
how many uh laptops or how many nodes

1159
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,140
you have on your network and he said I

1160
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,119
have no idea

1161
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,040
Network diagrams know what's on your

1162
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,260
network what what could be affected what

1163
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,260
the impact would be if uh if something

1164
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,180
if you were a victim of a cyber incident

1165
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,020
yeah

1166
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,140
what we won't do so what we will not do

1167
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,760
I always want to be clear about this

1168
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,500
again dispelling a lot of myths and

1169
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,660
misconceptions the FBI and the federal

1170
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,520
government's never going to recommend a

1171
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,960
particular product or service we get

1172
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,099
called and saying hey what should we buy

1173
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,599
what firewall should I buy that's going

1174
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,280
to stop this from happening again I'm

1175
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,780
not going to say that right because the

1176
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,400
federal government can't recommend any

1177
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,079
specific product or service and say yeah

1178
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,300
Cisco is the one you have to use Cisco

1179
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,280
or you need to use Microsoft we're never

1180
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,020
going to do that we're also not there

1181
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,060
when we come in we're not going to

1182
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,520
remediate your network right it's not my

1183
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,099
job or the FBI's job to reinstall your

1184
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,720
operating system and reconfigure your

1185
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,280
mail server that's not what we're there

1186
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,560
for but what we are going to do we're

1187
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,760
going to provide you with all the

1188
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,079
information that we're finding during

1189
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,420
the investigation right the hopefully

1190
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,560
identifying the initial point of

1191
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,660
compromise how they Traverse across your

1192
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,460
network what accounts got compromised

1193
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,440
what do you need to do to recover from

1194
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,359
your net your recover your network but

1195
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,060
also make sure that you understand how

1196
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,380
they got in so you can keep them from

1197
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,579
getting in again

1198
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:34,619
uh we can recommend General best

1199
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,060
practices engage other government

1200
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,740
entities such as cisa to come in maybe

1201
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,200
help with tabletop exercises or best

1202
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,720
practices for hardening your networks we

1203
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,020
won't deploy tools on your network

1204
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,339
without consent you know we have a lot

1205
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,079
of our own custom tools that we built we

1206
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,300
you use some commercial stuff but we're

1207
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,500
going to make sure you guys understand

1208
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,319
what that does and make sure you fully

1209
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,119
understand what we're trying to collect

1210
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,560
how we're going to collect it and a lot

1211
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,000
of times we need your assistance to a

1212
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,280
group policy or Powershell or some other

1213
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,260
way to deploy some of these agents

1214
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,599
across the network maybe it's only 10 we

1215
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:07,619
need to get because we've only

1216
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,119
identified 10 computers in a particular

1217
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,440
department but again we're going to work

1218
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,300
with you on that and we're not going to

1219
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,040
exceed the consent if you say Hey you

1220
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,660
can go search these 10 computers in the

1221
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,920
server over here we're not going to

1222
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,440
deploy our agent to 3000 boxes across

1223
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,599
your network and take all this data

1224
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,220
the other thing we're not going to do is

1225
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,180
we're not going to issue press

1226
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,880
statements I talked about earlier we

1227
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,319
typically don't issue press statements

1228
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,819
about a case until it's fully been

1229
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,160
adjudicated or and sometimes if it's

1230
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,599
announcing indictments again that's

1231
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,099
typically the Department of Justice it's

1232
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,140
not the FBI that's announcing that we're

1233
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,640
not going to name and shame victims a

1234
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,740
lot of legal process we write we remove

1235
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,540
we'll save victim organization number

1236
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,579
one we're not going to refer to that

1237
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,960
company and something that's eventually

1238
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,180
going to be publicly available to

1239
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,920
anybody to come to the court system and

1240
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,359
look at that we're not out there to name

1241
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,760
and shame and rub somebody's nose in it

1242
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,660
because they got breached

1243
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,000
so here here's a some of the the uh

1244
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,940
facilities we use to share information

1245
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,180
with uh private public sector uh we use

1246
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,920
you know flashes public industry

1247
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,960
notifications and public service service

1248
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,300
announcements so like I said in some of

1249
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,920
the some of the cases where you may be

1250
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,500
seeing something might not have uh

1251
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,020
become a cyber threat yet but you're

1252
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,819
kind of seeing things develop give us a

1253
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,099
call and you know share those indicators

1254
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:25,560
with us and we can put it out to the to

1255
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,500
the private sector and again it would

1256
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,780
only help to uh

1257
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,420
help to harden your networks Harden your

1258
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,339
your facilities and bring more awareness

1259
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:38,460
to to potential victims

1260
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,060
and that is our presentation

1261
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,060
thank you

1262
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,460
questions

1263
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,220
you guys to do

1264
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,480
this which is definitely always I mean

1265
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,339
I've made

1266
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:12,839
it

1267
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,319
yeah

1268
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,400
you know you're right there has been a

1269
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,500
lot of political politicization at the

1270
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,420
top levels and in the press and people

1271
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,359
like to use us as like uh a Whipping Boy

1272
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,760
for both sides and you know our job is

1273
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,380
to stay out of that yes it's happened

1274
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,880
certainly at the higher levels but

1275
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,559
that's why we're out here today doing

1276
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,780
this Outreach we want to show that you

1277
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,880
know we're not that we're we are

1278
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,859
apolitical our job is to uphold the

1279
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,500
Constitution our job is to pursue Bad

1280
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,480
actors and try and bring Justice to

1281
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,980
those who have done

1282
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,559
been done harm to them so we're trying

1283
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,540
to show through our actions and the

1284
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,099
engagement that we were protecting that

1285
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:54,480
information that we're doing the right

1286
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,319
things that we are there to help you and

1287
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,480
be a partner and not somebody that you

1288
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,040
have to fear is going to do something

1289
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,319
that's going to harm your organization

1290
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,720
yep

1291
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,220
yeah because we've got our own internal

1292
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,420
get and we've been working with our

1293
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,700
legal folks on ways that we can make

1294
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,020
some of those tools publicly available

1295
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,579
because they're not doing anything super

1296
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,859
sexy or anything they're just been

1297
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,300
customized for what we want sometimes

1298
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,619
obviously we're like I said earlier we

1299
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,980
have access to certain uh indicators

1300
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,859
yard rules uh other things that we can

1301
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,599
deploy some of it may have obviously

1302
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,339
been garnered from classified sources

1303
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:39,720
that's why we can't share that but the

1304
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,579
tools in general are doing the typical

1305
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:42,900
things that a lot of these endpoint

1306
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,220
sensors and other things are doing

1307
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,079
they're just doing in a way that we need

1308
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,579
it to be done specific to our

1309
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:49,819
investigations

1310
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:53,058
yes sir

1311
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,880
so a lot of that comes down to a talked

1312
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,920
earlier on how over the past decade or

1313
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,900
so we've Blended a lot more National

1314
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,819
Security investigation tools traditional

1315
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:15,300
702 fisa things like that uh with

1316
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,460
criminal process so some of that stuff's

1317
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,020
been Blended over sometimes it's working

1318
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,540
with our other U.S intelligence Partners

1319
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,520
so I can't really get into the weeds too

1320
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,200
much with that but we are able to obtain

1321
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,119
that stuff and I'm being told it's time

1322
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,040
to shut the up and get off the

1323
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,020
stage

1324
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,020
laughs

1325
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,920
yeah nobody's guilty until they go to a

1326
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,119
court of law and it gets adjudicated

1327
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,140
they've been charged with the crime

1328
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,059
they've not been convicted thank you

1329
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:42,720
thank you

1330
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,290
[Applause]
