1
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,840
hey everybody

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,160
after a little bit of technical

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
difficulty we are ready to roll

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
my name is nick popovich and uh today

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
we're going to be talking about

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
email security and a little bit of a

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,320
riff on it but i figured the next slide

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
um we should start with

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,360
a little about me

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,239
i'm an offensive security researcher

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,360
hacker

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
uh been an rvs community member for a

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,399
number of years

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
and so we wanted to talk about and level

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,800
set on some definitions

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,199
um when we talk about phishing

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,800
this is pulled straight from this

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
special publication about what phishing

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,399
is but we understand that it's an email

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,720
that's sent to coerce an advantageous

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
action that would be

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
a benefit for an attacker

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
right

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
and so

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
the ways that those emails are and

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,799
there's also different takes on that

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080
you've got smishing wishing

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
all sorts of issues the whole point is

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,479
that for the initial access into an

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,759
organization

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,880
many times you're going to rely on

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,240
social engineering and phishing we

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
understand that there's a lot of us here

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,119
who make good money doing it for a

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
living offensive security and there's

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
folks defensive security who are trying

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
to have telemetry and monitor these

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,840
types of things

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
so we see some common trait guidance

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
that we give users is it an urgent call

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,720
to action uh it's first time or not a

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
most common sender that's coming in a

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
generic greeting mismatch email domain

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
so if it's coming from some sas provider

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,560
right

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
versus your maybe organizational owned

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,119
domain name and then suspicious or

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
unexpected attachments or links

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,960
so some of the stuff pulled from the

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
anti-fishing working group fissures

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,799
themselves register more than half of

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,600
the domain names on which fishing occurs

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,639
so the the old days of spoofing the

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,399
domain from a mail server is really dead

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,360
that's just not going to get you

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
anywhere

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
you can still try but your emails are

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
never going to land

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
and 65 of maliciously registered domain

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,800
names are used for phishing within five

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
days of registration so that means you

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
go buy a domain name

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
you go set it up and you start your

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
campaign

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,720
so

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
professionally i am professionally evil

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
and what that means is i've been a red

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
team operator now for for a number of

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
years i've been a pen tester it means

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,519
that i'm meant to think

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
as an attacker to attempt to test the

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
effectiveness or the efficacy of the

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
defensive security controls that

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,080
organizations set up in their

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,360
environments

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
and so one of my jobs the whole idea

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
then being the outcome of those

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
assessment and testing activities to

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
raise the security posture so as we find

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
findings as we find holes they're

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
plugged

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,519
and so

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,040
a novel thought this is not original

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,319
research mind you this has been around

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,080
for a number of years it's just the

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
number of times i've talked to

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
executives and used the techniques that

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
i'm going to talk through right now that

90
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
have been effective consistently has not

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
changed in years and so i wanted to

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
raise awareness organizationally that

93
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
your phishing protections and the

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,599
phishing campaigns and your spam filters

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
that you're relying on

96
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
there may be a time to re-look at those

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
re-look at the whole paradigm that

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
you're using well not the whole paradigm

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
because it's iterative it stacks on top

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
of each other we are protecting and

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,799
looking for indicators of compromise

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
suspicious ip addresses and weird things

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
we're training our users in certain ways

104
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
well what i want to do is explore the

105
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
concept that there are now um

106
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
it's called lots living off of trusted

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
services

108
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
so i want to be super super super clear

109
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,959
this is not a poop on these vendors

110
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
session and there are hundreds of others

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
this is just examples

112
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
they are not really doing anything wrong

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
what the talk is going to talk more

114
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,760
through is the idea of being able to

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
utilize these services

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,159
that are provided as a value in

117
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
unexpected and malicious ways

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,400
and then we're going to talk through

119
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
maybe some concepts of how to protect

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
your organizations and environments so

121
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
the idea here is these organizations

122
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,319
provide powerful productivity and

123
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
business tools to organizations

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,639
and there's a level of trust if you get

125
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,720
an email that's digitally signed and

126
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
comes from a microsoft email address and

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
you get a link in that email that goes

128
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
to a microsoft ip space to a certificate

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
that's signed by microsoft ca

130
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
i think most of us in here would nod and

131
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,199
be like that seems like a trusted

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
thing to deal with and i'm going to show

133
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
you how you can use everything i just

134
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
said maliciously to lead to

135
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,680
attacker-controlled content

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,479
and we're going to walk through two

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,759
examples

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,960
and again that's not that's just because

139
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
they're the funnest and easiest and most

140
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
recent on the top of my head

141
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
understand that there are

142
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
hundreds of examples of doing this

143
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
so if we go back to

144
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,800
um

145
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
our background

146
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
we talk about an urgent call all the

147
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
common guidance to identify phishing i

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
think over the last 30 40 50

149
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,560
000 years

150
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
that we've been training users on how to

151
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,880
avoid recognize and detect phishing

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
emails we tell them things like if it

153
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
comes from outside your environment

154
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,199
if it's if it's something that

155
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
you don't get often

156
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
and if it's from outside of your domain

157
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,160
it's got a link and it tells you to do

158
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
something that's a phishing email and

159
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
then we send them

160
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
two dozen of those a week from all of

161
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,639
the sas services in our environment

162
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,199
think about uh uh you know the the

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,240
travel system the hr system the policy

164
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
uh adherence to this this training that

165
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,479
training what what does it usually an

166
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,880
urgent call to action you need to go do

167
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
something click on this link to uh fill

168
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,680
out your pop

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
first time or there's so many times i

170
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
get an email from some sas provider in

171
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,320
my work email and it's like what what

172
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
what what

173
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,919
what is this what even is this

174
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,280
generic greetings

175
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,639
hello

176
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,080
you need to log in here and accept the

177
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,800
new acceptable use policy in something

178
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,199
something something something dot com

179
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
mismatched email domains it's many times

180
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
these sas emails are not coming from

181
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,400
company.com

182
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,160
right your organization it's coming from

183
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,319
the sas provider email address and it's

184
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,080
got links or attachments in it so we

185
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
check all the boxes and we're sending

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
emails to our users

187
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,759
consistently

188
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
encouraging them actually not just

189
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
encouraging them demanding at times that

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
they follow these links so we are on one

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,199
side of our mouth saying these are

192
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,560
phishing emails and on the other side

193
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
saying just click it and do it so as a

194
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,199
user you are desensitized and trained to

195
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,520
just click on links that come in emails

196
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,840
super not fair

197
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
this is kind of a weird statement don't

198
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,039
put it down to put it away i just wanted

199
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,520
to talk about a concept in psychology

200
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
called

201
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,039
habituation

202
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
it's the idea that there's a decrease in

203
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
responsiveness upon repeated exposure to

204
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
stimulus

205
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
and so just picture me

206
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
little nikki

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,479
when i'm like nine years old my mom had

208
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,840
this statement she said don't put it

209
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,199
down put it away

210
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
clean up the clutter clean the mess and

211
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
she put signs all over the house don't

212
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,319
put it down put it away she would say

213
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
don't put it down put it away and that

214
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,160
worked for like one day because the

215
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,919
signs were new i walked into the

216
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
playroom like oh yeah don't put it down

217
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,599
put it away

218
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,800
and the next day i walk in and there's

219
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
that sign don't put it down put it away

220
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,120
and there's that sign don't put it down

221
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
put it away so habituation is the

222
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
concept and if we rely on the security

223
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
control i think the title of this talk

224
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
you get where i'm going right

225
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
many organizations that i've spoken to

226
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
it's talked about these uh you know

227
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,560
phishing threats say well every external

228
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
email we have has this banner attached

229
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
to us there's a warning this message

230
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,039
originated outside of the organization

231
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,720
be careful with these links you know

232
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
what that mattered for about one week

233
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
because habituation comes in

234
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,199
you get used to seeing it and now that

235
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,840
warning means

236
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,800
squat

237
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,080
so relying on your spam filters relying

238
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
on

239
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
uh

240
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,560
the users seeing that banner and caring

241
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,360
and and just a quick sidebar

242
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
there are ways to make that banner

243
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,759
disappear

244
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,039
these aren't oda's or anything like that

245
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,639
but i will this is a little ad hoc but

246
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
i'll just drop in there are headers that

247
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,599
you can add to emails from outside your

248
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,039
organization that will take that banner

249
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
away if the organization uses things

250
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,479
like fish me or no before because many

251
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
times if you add headers that are for

252
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,120
fishmeal before they want that banner to

253
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,199
be gone so that you get more links

254
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,639
clicked and stuff like that so i found

255
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,680
that out

256
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
through trial and error your mileage may

257
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,199
vary research i'm not going to give you

258
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,919
the exact headers you can google that

259
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,080
anywho and i'm not against fishmeat and

260
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,120
no before by the way those are cool

261
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
services they track the clicks that's

262
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,520
fine

263
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,599
do you

264
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,120
so real quick i'm not going to waste

265
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,719
your time but for some folks they may

266
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,240
not be familiar with what i'll call a

267
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
tried and true method for setting up a

268
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
phishing engagement the pen testers in

269
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,279
the audience the red teamers this is

270
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
what we do day in and day out

271
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
but we're going to talk through how it

272
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,959
sets up and how you'd usually roll and

273
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,320
then i'm going to show you i've got a

274
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
couple videos because i decided doing it

275
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
live was a bad idea i'm going to show

276
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
you how to send emails that are 99 gonna

277
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
land in the inbox and abuse the trust of

278
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,360
trusted services to deliver phishing

279
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
emails and how attackers do

280
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,640
so first and foremost we're going to

281
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
acquire the domain categorize the domain

282
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
establish the security dns records and

283
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,880
we're going to email warm up and then we

284
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
are ready to send phishing and we're

285
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
going to just talk through what that

286
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
looks like so it's kind of tough to see

287
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
one of the things i like to do is either

288
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
go you buy an expired domain

289
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,000
so that's got a history and so this

290
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,880
expireddomains.net you can go and find

291
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
expired domains and see what kind of

292
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
history they have you can use search

293
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
terms on them find all sorts of fun

294
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,519
stuff and what's nice is that does the

295
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,959
work for you many times so an attacker

296
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,040
may go and for eight bucks buy a domain

297
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,959
that's got a great trust score keywords

298
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,800
they like and already is categorized and

299
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
has history in it so that's kind of

300
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
handy so you go and you figure out you

301
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,480
buy a dns name now for this talk that's

302
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
an example of i don't even want to

303
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,200
search anybody that's just showing you

304
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
uh you know domains that are available

305
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,760
with richmond and their alexa score you

306
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
know these expired yesterday

307
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
so for the sake of this i bought picolus

308
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
hyphen cage.com

309
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
just because piccolo's cage was open

310
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,480
nicolas cage was not open

311
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
so now if you didn't go through the step

312
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,480
before and you buy a domain that's

313
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
already categorized

314
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,440
you need to categorize the domain this

315
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
is important for a number of reasons one

316
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
if you're going to have your users

317
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
communicate with the domain like you

318
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
need to browse to something many many

319
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,079
proxy services and egress filtering is

320
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,440
not going to allow it out if it's

321
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
uncategorized you put an ip address in

322
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
there you know proxy palo alto uh all of

323
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,079
these enterprise they're not going to

324
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
let you connect out because it is either

325
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,519
in an uncategorized status or it's in a

326
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,440
a status that it is um bad malicious

327
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,800
evil

328
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
but what's neat

329
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,079
about the trust that the internet

330
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,640
affords humans is that you can go to all

331
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
of these sites and ask them to

332
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,279
categorize your domain and make sure

333
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,800
it's got benign content or conjugated

334
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,399
and it categorizes typically in a matter

335
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
of minutes and all of a sudden the

336
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,519
domain you bought is categorized now i

337
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,000
will copy out that lately

338
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
time is the deal so if you buy a domain

339
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
it's going to be in this newly new

340
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
category for like 30 to 60 days so what

341
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,800
what a lot of attackers do and red

342
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
teamers do and threat actors will do is

343
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,880
buy domains and mass buy good generic

344
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,120
spicy domains sit on them categorize

345
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
them let them sit redirect to a blog put

346
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,160
some benign content on there get it

347
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,880
categorized as i.t and technology blog

348
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
personal finance whatever as long as it

349
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
gets a category and these are the type

350
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,000
these are the sites you can go to for

351
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,640
like blue coat palo alto sonic wall all

352
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,920
these and you can just say please

353
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
categorize my domain i actually only use

354
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,120
a couple

355
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
once you get categorized in one or two

356
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,240
it trickles down they kind of trust each

357
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
other and you get yourself your c2 and

358
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
your phishing domain categorized easy

359
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,040
peasy lemon squeezy so here's an example

360
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
of showing testing the site of rva sex

361
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
so it's a

362
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
blog and it's a low risk so this is

363
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
checking the category as long as you

364
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,480
check the category and you look benign

365
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,200
you're good to go

366
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,560
this is another check so this is

367
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
technology internet bluecoat thinks that

368
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
rvasec.com is technology internet so

369
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,639
when somebody on an organization goes to

370
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,120
this website it's gonna the egress

371
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
filter is gonna see the traffic say this

372
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,920
is categorized technology internet it's

373
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,120
not malicious it's not bad it's not

374
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
unknown we'll let it out

375
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
so this is an example of putting in a

376
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
request of the domain that i just bought

377
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
piccolo's cage

378
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,440
so picolas cage was categorized or i put

379
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,079
in a request

380
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,639
i can't read that

381
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,880
so it categorized piccolo's cage as

382
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
entertainment and arts because all i did

383
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
was i bought the dns record and i put a

384
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
redirect to nicholas's cage imdb entry

385
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
and then i put in submit request and it

386
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
came in and categorized it as

387
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,279
entertainment and arts so now my domain

388
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,440
is categorized i'm ready to use it

389
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,880
luckily enough i don't know i must have

390
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
been doing so much sketchy stuff that i

391
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
was trying to get another screenshot

392
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,240
uh and if you check the categorization

393
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,839
of this now it says

394
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,279
suspicious but i did a lot of funky

395
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,040
stuff with this in between we take

396
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
getting it categorized or not so

397
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,120
and that's actually remember that

398
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
remember that

399
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
all the work that i'm doing this is you

400
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,600
know now i got to go in and establish

401
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
dns records so i set up the mail

402
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
exchange records you know i like to set

403
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
up and use g suite and google but

404
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
whatever you use an o365 using g suite

405
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,279
whatever you're using as an smtp relay

406
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,720
service you go set up your mail exchange

407
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
records and so in this case we look at

408
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
my mx records for pickles cage i'm using

409
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
google to send and receive email

410
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
also it needs to look not suspicious if

411
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,079
you just have a domain name that has no

412
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,920
records associated with it that's super

413
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
sus

414
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
all this work that i'm doing though at

415
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,440
any point in time

416
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,160
if if it starts and as malicious it's

417
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,399
hosed and now i got to start all over

418
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,320
again and so i thought there had to be a

419
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
better way before we get there we're

420
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,399
going to go through all these steps just

421
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,160
remember the fact that at any point if

422
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
this don't if this dns record gets

423
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,519
burned

424
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,880
i can't use it as a fishing and

425
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,240
attackers can't use it as a phishing

426
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,519
domain

427
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,480
so now i'm setting up uh spf sender

428
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
policy framework records uh email

429
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
security dictates that basically there's

430
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
a text record of dns type that when it's

431
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
queried it says this record specifically

432
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
says what mail servers what domains what

433
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
ip addresses and what friendly domains

434
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,720
are allowed to send email

435
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,079
on on

436
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
behalf of your organization

437
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,160
so if you don't have spf records set up

438
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,120
remember in the beginning of the talk

439
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240
when i said spoofing an email domain

440
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
will never work

441
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,079
i caveat that if you don't have spf up

442
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,199
it will

443
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,399
that means

444
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,880
spf records prevent me from going up

445
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
spinning up a digitalocean instance

446
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
installing a mail server saying that

447
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,519
it's authoritative for rvasec.com and

448
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,959
just going and sending email as

449
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,199
rvasec.com if they didn't have spf

450
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,519
records i could do that

451
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,160
and it wouldn't be flagged as fraudulent

452
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,880
but almost universally organizations

453
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,040
have center policy frameworks set up

454
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
and you can look this is the you know

455
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,680
google help you on how to set up the the

456
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,959
string we're not going to go in depth on

457
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,480
it there's a specific string you set up

458
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
it's a text record in dns you set this

459
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
string that says these ips are allowed

460
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,240
to send so down there i don't have a

461
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,160
no i'm just kidding i don't have a laser

462
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
point but that last line is saying spf

463
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,760
include so i'm just saying all google

464
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,440
email servers have permission to send

465
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,279
for

466
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,639
piccolouscage.net now we have to set up

467
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,120
the domain keys identified mail record

468
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,959
again it's another dns security

469
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,959
mechanism what it does is the email

470
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,720
service that you set up you set up a

471
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
specific record that says

472
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
there's a private key on the email

473
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
server and a public key set up in a text

474
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,720
record and every time it sends it checks

475
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,000
using the public key to see if it was

476
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,279
signed by the private key by the server

477
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,959
that you've said in spf it's allowed to

478
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
send from so it's digitally signed by a

479
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,680
server so it's added you know dkim needs

480
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
to make sure you need dmarc and dqm set

481
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,199
up to validate spf so in google you just

482
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,560
go in you say

483
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
register a dkm record put the

484
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
representative text record up and you're

485
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,920
good to go

486
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
so there's my dkim record cool i've got

487
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,240
dqm set up and so now we look

488
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,079
for piccolostatecage.com if you look at

489
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,560
the origin in in gmail we can see that i

490
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
pass with spf i'm sending from the right

491
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,600
kind of

492
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
email address i passed dkim

493
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,920
neat

494
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,079
now the last step is setting up dmarc

495
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
basically what dmarc is is a policy it's

496
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
another dns record the idea being if you

497
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,079
own an organization's dns and you have

498
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,800
permission to set up all the dns records

499
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,160
you've got keys the kingdom for all

500
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,519
their email

501
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,120
the point being is you set up a policy

502
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
that says if dkim fails and spf fails

503
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
uh or we have a an email come in that

504
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
that doesn't work out and it seems wrong

505
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,560
we don't we don't trust the source from

506
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,079
it what to do with it you quarantine it

507
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,800
send it away deny it et cetera so

508
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
we set up a dmarc record

509
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,519
all of this stuff to say

510
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,199
i bought this domain that day and i set

511
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,800
this all up in about an hour i could

512
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,079
have done it all

513
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,360
you know have all this automation

514
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
whiz-bang run some powershell run some

515
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,759
scripts to get it done in 15 minutes but

516
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,680
so attackers can do that

517
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
threat actors can do that red teamers do

518
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,680
that all we do is establish a domain

519
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
that we think is spicy we think it's

520
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,800
going to trick somebody we think it's

521
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,079
going to have a good trust in it we set

522
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,000
up the appropriate records and now there

523
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
is nothing wrong with this domain other

524
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
than how how old it is so in about three

525
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,359
weeks there is nothing wrong with this

526
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,880
domain there is no reason that a spam

527
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
filter will send this to spam

528
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
i have a categorization i have all the

529
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
right dns records and i can even

530
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
nowadays um we have there's email

531
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,720
warm-up services i actually skipped this

532
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,319
a lot because i am what the ancient

533
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,000
greeks call

534
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,959
lazy

535
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,160
but

536
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,119
when i'm

537
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,720
depends on the type of gig i'm on if i'm

538
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,039
if i'm on a three-month red team up yeah

539
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,320
i'll do the email warm-up and all that

540
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
does it's a crowd and you can do it for

541
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,679
free is it sends and receives emails so

542
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,440
there's email that means there's dns

543
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,840
records being because some organizations

544
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
will start having this telemetry where

545
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,360
if there's never been dns queries or

546
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,679
your domain is your domain is four days

547
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,640
old and it has 11 dns queries

548
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
it's gonna be like

549
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,559
probably suspicious so if you're sending

550
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,840
a bunch of emails you've got some

551
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
scripts maybe to

552
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
curl your website every once again get

553
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,720
some dns get some email traffic get some

554
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
stuff going that just helps add

555
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,039
legitimacy to your website all in said

556
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
is done

557
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
that took me an after that took me an

558
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,880
hour buy a domain set up all the stuff

559
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
now i have and now attackers have

560
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,080
a domain they can send emails from

561
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
that's seems like a lot of work it's

562
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,679
actually not that much but at any point

563
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,640
in time

564
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
if that goes awry if i start going to

565
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,840
spam filters if i send an email it goes

566
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,400
to spam or if that site gets categorized

567
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
as malicious i've got to do it all over

568
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
again i'm going to go find new domains

569
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,880
and keep cycling he's like it's kind of

570
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
annoying and also if you set your sweet

571
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
pretext up you sat there you know

572
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,600
brushing your teeth like i do and

573
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
thinking about alright how am i going to

574
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
trick people today how am i going to

575
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,919
trick people to click on my messages

576
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,480
click on my spicy links

577
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,919
and you've got this sweet story you've

578
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,600
concocted in your head of like oh you

579
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,799
come up with it you got your narrative

580
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,840
maybe you even started building a

581
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,200
website like a landing page with

582
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,039
graphics and you did the css and then it

583
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,320
gets burned you're like son of a gun i

584
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,240
gotta go do all that again

585
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
so this website

586
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,840
is bananas

587
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
it's the living off trusted sites

588
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
project there's this uh this twitter

589
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
handle of mr docs

590
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,600
um and he has this list uh i haven't

591
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,640
counted it

592
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,520
i should have cause that would have been

593
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
a cool stat to put up there

594
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
there is

595
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
three or four dozen sites

596
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,799
and he categorized well let's eff it

597
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,919
let's go live

598
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,679
let's look at it

599
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,400
yeah we good we good

600
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
so let's go to this site

601
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,440
i don't have internet so never mind and

602
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
i'm not gonna connect with

603
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,600
wireless if you go there it it lists the

604
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,720
site

605
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,799
that says you know that site maybe it

606
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
says microsoft maybe it says confluence

607
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
maybe it says uh whatever and it says it

608
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,559
can be used for phishing command and

609
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,559
control so c2 and command control is the

610
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,480
idea of a malicious actor having the

611
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,240
ability to command

612
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,039
and control your endpoint so as an

613
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,600
attacker i want c2 and i want phishing

614
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
and this site lists all of these this is

615
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,320
basically what this talk is based off of

616
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,960
and what's what's absolutely bananas is

617
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,039
i've been pen testing since

618
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,960
i don't know whenever chris hired me

619
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
back in the day

620
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
and i've been red teaming for about

621
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
three years

622
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
the number of

623
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,200
uh sites that are on here that just just

624
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
pass through and and drop right in and

625
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,159
it just constantly works is mind-blowing

626
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,600
and bananas

627
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,559
so now

628
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,159
we're going to show you how you can

629
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,480
rather than set up all the stuff that i

630
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
just talked about setting up you can far

631
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
more easily just send an email from

632
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
microsoft just send an email from

633
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,520
atlassian

634
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,159
and fully control it it's fully

635
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
shenaniganized

636
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
and then what i'd like to do

637
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
with the last few minutes is have a

638
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
little bit of an open dialogue so

639
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,600
as i was talking about this with

640
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
folks

641
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,120
um either in engagements or

642
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,400
conversationally we were trying to talk

643
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
about so how would you fix this

644
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
and again this is not saying that that

645
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,080
the onus is on microsoft or the onus is

646
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,559
on jira the onus is on organizations to

647
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,000
figure out what you're going to do for

648
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
your organization to solve this and i

649
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
don't have many good answers i have a

650
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,200
couple ideas but it would be interesting

651
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
for you folks to chew on and at the end

652
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
of the talk

653
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
i would like to hear maybe if you've got

654
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
some thoughts like what would you do to

655
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,760
stop what i'm about to show you because

656
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
sixty percent of time this works a

657
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
hundred percent of the time

658
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,240
i don't know why i keep coming over here

659
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
and pushing the butt i have a clicker

660
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,679
so

661
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,120
first thing we're going to talk through

662
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,439
is not that

663
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,240
all right

664
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,159
i don't know how those slide that's like

665
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,880
he's got auto order that's okay

666
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,919
so the first thing we're going to talk

667
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,960
about

668
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,919
i'm going to walk through a bunch of

669
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,280
slides

670
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,200
talking about how to send email

671
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,360
maliciously using jira

672
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,919
if you haven't heard of jira

673
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
neat

674
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,400
a lot of places use jira a lot of places

675
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
use jira nests for all sorts of reasons

676
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
for for developments devops ticketing

677
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
all that good stuff blah blah we all

678
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
know jira cool thing is you can get a

679
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,640
free instance of

680
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,960
of confluence in jira by just saying i

681
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
want one

682
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
so

683
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,559
and then don't worry it's not gonna be

684
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,080
death by powerpoint i have actually a

685
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
couple live videos of doing the next one

686
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,720
so you don't have to keep looking at

687
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,960
slides but the idea is you just oh i'm

688
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
not doing the presentation that's why my

689
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,960
clicky clack's not working

690
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
so we sign up

691
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,960
free

692
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
email address don't have to put a credit

693
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,919
card nothing so i created a project

694
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,799
called gone fishing

695
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,840
i created a board with an issue

696
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,679
and i said

697
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,679
hacks or flicks

698
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
and so in that issue

699
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
i added

700
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,640
um

701
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,520
you know

702
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
the description has an evil link has

703
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
evil discussions thing i added a web

704
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,120
link to a video or that could be a web

705
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
link to efficiently i've added links to

706
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,840
this

707
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,360
this jira board

708
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,200
okay

709
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,000
and now i go in and i go to add a user

710
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,280
now interestingly enough i spent far too

711
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,480
long on this and this is weird and uh

712
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,320
yeah

713
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,840
so i don't know enough about jira and

714
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,200
maybe jira and admin can tell me if

715
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
there's a difference in the pay for

716
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,799
version or if it's taken out but i got

717
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,640
this to work and i have the proof of it

718
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,840
somewhere but then i couldn't get it to

719
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,280
work again so i'll tell you the work

720
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,039
around that i got but being able

721
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,400
basically what i wanted to do and what

722
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,840
i've done in the past

723
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
many times and i think maybe they locked

724
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
it down because of this issue

725
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,919
is you want the ability to invite an

726
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,120
external user to be to view your jira

727
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,520
project and so that email invite is

728
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
going to come from jira and you control

729
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,080
the body of it what's interesting is it

730
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,720
at this so the first time i did this

731
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
and i've used it many times before i

732
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
could send an email to an email address

733
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840
and then i noticed that there was this

734
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,559
uh

735
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,480
java response that says send to remote

736
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,159
email false and all this stuff i don't

737
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,520
know if it's just for me just for the

738
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,279
world control with javascript i tried to

739
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,120
bypass it i eventually ended up figuring

740
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,440
it out and sent an email to an email

741
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
address outside the jira project but i

742
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,039
wasn't in burp i didn't capture my

743
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,480
session and i couldn't figure it out

744
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
again but i found a workaround so if i

745
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
want to send a phishing email basically

746
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,679
from jira saying

747
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,840
click my link do my stuff what i ended

748
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,200
up finding out

749
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
was as i tried to do it

750
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
i got this disable sharing to emails

751
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,039
true

752
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,960
so i changed it to false and i was able

753
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
to type an email in there but then when

754
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,640
i tried it said 403 forbidden

755
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,000
but what's bananas is the first time i

756
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
tried it it sent an email and i have the

757
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,600
but the work around that i found

758
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,919
was if you go in

759
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,159
and you add

760
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,159
them to your project don't invite them

761
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,760
to your board but you add them invite

762
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,000
them to your project

763
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,679
they don't even have to accept then

764
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
after going in and sharing the issue i

765
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
had the ability to share that issue out

766
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,640
so that's a little bit of a workaround

767
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
what's also interesting the invite to

768
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,640
project email went to spam

769
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
but this email

770
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
asking them to come to my jira board

771
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,000
went right in so i sent this to

772
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
uh

773
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,640
the king

774
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
at piccolo's cage

775
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,400
or i sent this to king piccolouscage.com

776
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
and basically here what i want to show

777
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,240
you is this email has a link in it

778
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,640
and it turned into a link

779
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,000
and if we look

780
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,919
it passes all the checks it's coming

781
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,520
from my atlassian project from

782
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,760
pipefishtalk.atlassian.net

783
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
it's called i sent that to my gmail then

784
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,159
we see

785
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,360
it passes spf passes dkm passes dmarc

786
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,480
there's no reason this shouldn't go to

787
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,000
spam or there's no reason this goes to

788
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,919
spam and it didn't so we go back we have

789
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,640
this email sent from atlassian

790
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,039
to the user so there's one place where

791
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,480
they might be able to be coerced if you

792
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
have now this is you know me being

793
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,159
smarmy with a one-liner but if you have

794
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,760
a log text or your pre-text is there

795
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,039
you're really good at social engineering

796
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,159
you get them you could get them

797
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,919
hypothetically to click on the link

798
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,279
right there you just sent them an email

799
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,880
a phishing link from jira

800
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
however comma

801
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,679
you see that big fat blue button

802
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,039
view issue

803
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,039
you can also in a paid version of jira

804
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,120
open your issues up to be anonymous so

805
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,159
that you don't have to have a jira

806
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,480
account to log in

807
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,720
so

808
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,760
this is the email i was telling you that

809
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,679
went to spam when i tried to send him to

810
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,200
join

811
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,880
so that's interesting and sending from

812
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
jira may be off of my list now because i

813
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
got to send them two emails and i can't

814
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,919
roll the dice on getting burned maybe

815
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,000
one email goes to spam one doesn't maybe

816
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,919
both don't they get confused both emails

817
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,039
causes trouble just to prove a point but

818
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,360
just imagine as a user who's confused

819
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,039
what you put in you got to go into this

820
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,320
jira board to accept your training or do

821
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,080
whatever all of a sudden the board is

822
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,200
open they log in and they've got a

823
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
description with all free text you can

824
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
add in information say go here and do

825
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,760
the thing

826
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,520
you got a link click on links you know

827
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
users just got to click on links

828
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,200
you got to click on the links

829
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
so

830
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
that

831
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
is just an example a little bit of a

832
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,679
clue as you walk through example of

833
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,279
using jira but do you get you you get

834
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,760
the idea you get the concept if i can

835
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,440
control the body of an email and i can

836
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,600
send on behalf of that email that was

837
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,360
signed sealed and delivered by jira just

838
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,039
for me the attacker

839
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,159
now let's get into something a little

840
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,799
bit more spicy

841
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,039
this is one of my favorite ones to do

842
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,320
i gotta stop saying spicy that's like

843
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,279
the ninth time i said that

844
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,799
and bananas let me keep tally of how

845
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,399
many times i say bananas and spicy no

846
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,360
don't do that it'll bum me out

847
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,960
so now let's get to one that's a little

848
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,279
bit more impactful

849
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,600
so within azure

850
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
we're going to talk about two different

851
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,559
ways to abuse azure

852
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,000
then we're going to have a free moment

853
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
to talk about how you would fix these

854
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
types of things and then we'll call it a

855
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,440
day

856
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,159
we have this concept within azure is api

857
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,880
management so i've gone in

858
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
i might make the video bigger so i'm

859
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,159
gonna make i'm not gonna do it from here

860
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,240
i'm gonna make it like super big so hold

861
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,720
on let me go

862
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,399
oh i'm still doing the show let me end

863
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,799
the show

864
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,399
and the show

865
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,279
and open up

866
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
this guy

867
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,000
and go full screen all right

868
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,279
man that's going fast i feel like it's

869
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,679
going faster than it was in the thing

870
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,840
so

871
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,199
is there a way to like play this slower

872
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,039
basically what happens is in azure you

873
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,200
can set up a free account

874
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,039
set up your free account or associate it

875
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,440
to a pay account you go and got googled

876
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,279
and got your

877
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,480
well you as a bread team are you going

878
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,159
to use your company's a card but as a

879
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,760
threat actor you're going to use some

880
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,159
poor hapless victims information but you

881
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,080
sign up for an azure project and there's

882
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,200
this idea of api management

883
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,799
so within api management

884
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,679
the play button oh here we go

885
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,279
so within api management i've created an

886
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,480
api management project

887
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,279
within the api management project you

888
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,960
have the ability

889
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,919
to

890
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,039
invite users to your project

891
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,559
so there's all sorts of cool

892
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,520
functionality here right

893
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,600
if i go and look at templates

894
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,960
i have these are all the types of

895
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,720
notification templates that you can send

896
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,640
to users and here's the invite user

897
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,159
template now you have complete control

898
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,919
of this you have complete control over

899
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,520
the subject line you have complete

900
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,600
control over the body and text and you

901
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,799
have the sweet

902
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,399
ability to have all this html and you

903
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,240
can make this email look like whatever

904
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,000
you want

905
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,279
so then based on how i've named this

906
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,960
and what settings i've set up i can

907
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,080
simply go down to users

908
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
and invite someone and you can also do

909
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,000
this in bulk mind you

910
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,919
i can invite someone to my project

911
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,320
now that sent an email

912
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,360
to king piccoloushyphencage.com

913
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,000
and if we go and look in the email

914
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,240
we've gotten an email and i could i mean

915
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,080
yes that's smarmy but think you could

916
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,320
control the entire body of this email

917
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,678
all the html all the links

918
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,880
i clicked the link

919
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,399
and you've gotten wrecked i just went to

920
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,240
hacker typer to prove a point

921
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,919
now let's again let's look at the the

922
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,679
origin of this this is an email sent

923
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,080
from mail.azurewebsites.net

924
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
it passes all the checks

925
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,559
you have total control of the from i

926
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,840
made it simple syrup it was no reply

927
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,440
that is going

928
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
that is coming from if you read into the

929
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,720
headers that's coming from microsoft

930
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
servers signed by microsoft that is a

931
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,919
legit

932
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,399
email

933
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
and i'm just showing you here now how

934
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,240
within the template settings you can

935
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,159
make a you can go in and change the from

936
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,880
and how you want that to display

937
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,360
so that's that's harrowing to me

938
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,840
because as an incident responder

939
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,360
if i see an email coming from microsoft

940
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,279
signed by microsoft

941
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,760
seems to be microsoft

942
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,159
what am i going to do

943
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:08,960
now

944
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,279
as of added bonus i'm going to show you

945
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,480
away

946
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,399
one of the many features of azure

947
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,440
functions

948
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,279
that i like to now show you how i can

949
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,640
control

950
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,720
an ip address that is

951
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,240
has a certificate digitally signed by

952
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,720
microsoft is on ipspace owned by

953
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,240
microsoft

954
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,720
and can be used for c2

955
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,320
so

956
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,120
let's hop over to the next video

957
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
join me

958
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,360
join me on this journey

959
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,640
so same idea instead of um

960
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,799
instead of an api management project

961
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,559
i've created a function app

962
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,559
so think about like

963
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,679
and i don't know you might correct me if

964
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,120
i'm wrong but the way i think of it is

965
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,039
like being able to run code as a service

966
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,640
like infrastructure as a

967
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,880
you know like aws lambda

968
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,080
that type of stuff i'm sure there's more

969
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,360
into it than that but when i look at

970
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,600
stuff i look at how how can i get the

971
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,240
easiest way to abuse it

972
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,799
and so within the function app that i

973
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,279
created

974
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,519
rv asex pipefishes its name there's

975
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,039
functionality in the older version

976
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,120
called proxy

977
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,559
and so what i could do think about

978
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,440
redirectors i have a

979
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
actually don't think about redirectors

980
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,919
think about redirectors when i tell you

981
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,360
on the next slide because i have a sweet

982
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,279
diagram that will help it

983
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,279
basically what i'm doing here

984
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,679
is i'm creating a rule

985
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,159
that says if you come to this

986
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,679
end point which i'll show you in a

987
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,600
moment i want you to redirect all

988
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,840
traffic to this other endpoint

989
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
the idea being it's simply acting as a

990
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,440
proxy all http traffic that hits this

991
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,679
endpoint that i'm about to show you

992
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,519
is going to be rerouted so those of us

993
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,279
who familiar with the

994
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,960
beautiful tool cobalt strike and the

995
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,240
concept of redirectors and why you'd

996
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,440
want to set up redirects we'll dig into

997
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,880
that in just a moment

998
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,559
but what i've done here is i want you to

999
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,679
go to a little website called

1000
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,399
whatsmyip.com

1001
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,200
that's a little website i use it's goofy

1002
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,960
it just shows you external ip address

1003
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,880
so now i'm going to save this project

1004
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,240
i'm going to pause the video for just a

1005
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,600
moment after it saves

1006
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,120
all right actually no right here so

1007
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,279
the proxy url is given to me right there

1008
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,039
i have this proxy url and it's the name

1009
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,880
of my project so i named my project

1010
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,799
rvasec pipefish

1011
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,159
so the name of your project dot

1012
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,120
azurewebsites.net

1013
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,000
so that endpoint

1014
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,039
has is running on a microsoft ip space i

1015
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,640
will demonstrate that in a moment

1016
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
that endpoint has

1017
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,880
a digital it has a certificate on it for

1018
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,919
ssl traffic signed by microsoft ca and

1019
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,080
all http traffic that hits that endpoint

1020
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,279
is going to be rerouted directly to the

1021
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,840
server that i control

1022
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,279
and we'll go over that for a moment i'm

1023
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,240
just going to now we're going to

1024
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
demonstrate the kind of the proof in the

1025
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,039
pudding so now

1026
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,399
so i'm going to browse to what's my ip

1027
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,119
just vanilla when you browse to that

1028
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,280
you're just seeing your ip address of

1029
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
where you're coming from right

1030
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,440
what's my ip

1031
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,359
so now let's browse to rvaseq

1032
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,359
pubfish.azurewebsites.net

1033
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
it's proxying all http traffic that's

1034
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,480
going to that endpoint and if you look

1035
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,599
at the cert

1036
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,879
i hope i look at the cert i feel like i

1037
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,560
looked at the cert i'll have a slide

1038
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,839
looking at the cert

1039
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,800
nice

1040
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,760
now let's go to that slide

1041
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,239
oh we'll go to that slide in a second

1042
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,760
now we're going to talk about

1043
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
just a visual of the idea especially

1044
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,639
from an attacker's perspective

1045
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,560
if i'm a threat actor and i'm trying to

1046
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,960
be able to hide my infrastructure

1047
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,199
if the blue team is only seeing attack

1048
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,760
activity going to

1049
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,639
azurewebsites.net website they have no

1050
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,720
insight into where it's going behind it

1051
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
so if you get burned you tear down your

1052
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
redirector and you spit up another one

1053
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,160
all your infrastructure back here all

1054
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,480
your hacks and cracks can stay it also

1055
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,280
confuses the origin of attack right

1056
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,599
so that's the concept of a redirector so

1057
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,000
now if i'm using an azure functions

1058
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,119
proxy

1059
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,880
to redirect all my traffic and the blue

1060
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,079
team is trying to figure out where is

1061
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,880
this attack going it's going to end up

1062
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,079
as far as they're concerned ending at

1063
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,680
microsoft and then they're going to have

1064
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,520
to go and involve microsoft and there's

1065
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,200
going to be legal stuff and it's all

1066
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,079
about layering it's all about layers

1067
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,359
ogres have layers

1068
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,599
so just as an example

1069
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,040
when i checked this site out that was

1070
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,720
azurewebsites.net

1071
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,759
signed by a microsoft certificate

1072
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
and we take a look at the ip address

1073
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,400
that it showed that's a microsoft owned

1074
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,240
ip

1075
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,280
okay

1076
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,880
so now we're at the point in this

1077
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
discussion where i kind of want to have

1078
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,800
a little bit of an open forum

1079
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
and i want to talk about ways that

1080
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,680
because when i talk to people about

1081
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,520
let's say okay you've demonstrated a

1082
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,280
problem and there are so many other so

1083
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,359
so many other ada i think every cloud

1084
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,359
provider every think about hire right

1085
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,640
think about all the different places

1086
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,680
where you need to be able to send an

1087
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,760
email from the service as an admin of

1088
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,680
the service it just the list goes on and

1089
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,240
on and i'm not anti-sas don't say i'm

1090
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,720
this anti luddite anti-cloud dude who's

1091
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,879
like

1092
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,200
but here's a couple thoughts i had when

1093
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,640
people like okay

1094
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,000
you've demonstrated a risk what's the

1095
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,640
remediation my first thought is

1096
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
a lot of these things a lot of these

1097
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,079
services have a means to go in and

1098
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,760
demonstrate ownership of dns records and

1099
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,520
send on behalf you'd have to edit some

1100
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,119
spf records you'd have to go in and

1101
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,640
change some dns and that's i get it

1102
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,000
that's a heavy lift for every sas

1103
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,359
service but i feel like some of the

1104
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,200
onboarding process should be if you're

1105
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,359
sending an email from concur or hire

1106
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,800
right or servicenow or this or mike all

1107
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
of these all of these had an option that

1108
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,839
i researched to be able to send email on

1109
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,920
behalf of that other domain now that's

1110
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,200
part of you know you need to do a risk

1111
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,119
assessment on how much are you giving

1112
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,960
them rights to send that and do you have

1113
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,640
that trust level but i think i think

1114
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,200
we're being disingenuous frankly and

1115
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,079
treating our users poorly by being like

1116
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,440
let's send you a bunch of these emails

1117
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,320
not from company.com so that's one one

1118
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,359
thought that i have i don't know if it's

1119
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,839
feasible or not

1120
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,079
um one thing that i've thought of for a

1121
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,160
long time is encouraging it's more of a

1122
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,960
procedural thing it's like

1123
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,400
encourage the use of a company portal

1124
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
rather than sending all these random

1125
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,680
links saying that there's a company

1126
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
portal either accessible by you know

1127
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,960
your agent or because i know the

1128
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,400
perimeter's gone now right we got the

1129
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,760
zero trust model so you can't say

1130
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,359
they're going to be inside on the vpn

1131
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,119
maybe you can still if you still have a

1132
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,520
perimeter your organization bully

1133
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,760
but having some sort of very well-known

1134
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,320
company portal landing page people know

1135
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
that they go here

1136
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,320
for company happenings news and if you

1137
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,720
have announcements you go to the hr site

1138
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
you go to the training site you go to

1139
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,359
the place you need to go via

1140
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,800
announcements on the company portal so

1141
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,960
internal emails or emails encouraging

1142
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,839
people to you know log into the platform

1143
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,119
from the company portal that's a thought

1144
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,200
i have and then maybe maybe another

1145
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,560
procedural thing is just straight up

1146
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
preparing users for these emails the

1147
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,800
number of emails that i get from random

1148
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,640
sas stuff that is legit and my company

1149
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
says no that's not phishing is too dang

1150
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,520
high

1151
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
but if i got an email coming in from a

1152
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,320
company email that was like by the way

1153
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,839
this week be on the lookout for your

1154
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,440
concur training for your whatever for

1155
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,040
this for that for the other

1156
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,560
at least i'm a little bit more prepared

1157
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,680
but

1158
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,160
that's really the the thrust of my talk

1159
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,920
is done and i kind of want to put it to

1160
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,359
you and if it goes qrikets that's fine

1161
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,720
we'll get chris to come up and chat for

1162
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,800
a moment about next steps but i would be

1163
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,640
curious after seeing

1164
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,960
um abusing sas

1165
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,800
to send emails on behalf of trusted

1166
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,520
sites what thoughts organizationally you

1167
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,240
have on how you think you could protect

1168
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,400
your users if you got something and you

1169
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
could speak with a command voice

1170
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,160
bring it up and you don't have crippling

1171
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,040
performance anxiety or like like i do

1172
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,119
the idea of standing up randomly

1173
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,720
from that seat in a conference and

1174
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,000
speaking is a nightmare but yeah i'd

1175
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,480
like to hear it

1176
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,040
content analysis interesting and you

1177
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,119
asked if there's progress on it i don't

1178
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,320
know

1179
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
i hope so

1180
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,240
any other thoughts on what you can do so

1181
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,520
content analysis that's interesting you

1182
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,680
know using heuristics using ocr using

1183
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,280
anomaly detection

1184
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,440
content analysis of those emails what

1185
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
you got

1186
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,079
safe links is cool yeah i i don't know i

1187
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,720
don't think so because

1188
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,320
i eat safe links enabled stuff for

1189
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,400
breakfast i mean

1190
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,079
i don't think so because safely like one

1191
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,200
of the things that attackers will do

1192
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,119
that i typically do i think it's a good

1193
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,160
added control because it's definitely

1194
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,599
something that you have to think through

1195
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,520
but like safely scans

1196
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
usually it'll send a quick couple of

1197
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,200
requests to the site and so what i do on

1198
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
my phishing infrastructure is i set up

1199
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,480
some sites and i get the safe links ip

1200
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,599
blocks and i just block them where i

1201
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,280
redirect them to benign stuff so when

1202
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,040
safe links and

1203
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,560
firearms stuff and all those defensive

1204
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
things scan me they get redirected to

1205
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,079
benign stuff but only legit users get me

1206
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,400
so but i think you're not wrong in the

1207
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,160
defense in depth strategy because if i

1208
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,240
don't have it or if safe links has a new

1209
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,680
source ip it's coming from and it gets

1210
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,280
i've been gotten by safe links so i had

1211
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,200
to adjust my tactics so

1212
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,560
defense in depth

1213
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,960
adding layers content analysis what

1214
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,240
other thoughts for organizations

1215
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,560
what you got

1216
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,319
that's fair

1217
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,960
might not be feasible yeah

1218
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,040
no no this is this i mean that's why i'm

1219
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,800
actually kind of in an odd way not being

1220
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
like thanks for coming to my ted talk

1221
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,079
i'm out i

1222
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,920
didn't have good remediations when

1223
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,040
people are like so what do we do about

1224
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,880
this i was like i'm gonna crowd

1225
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,079
source think this and get my rva sec

1226
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,119
thought leader friends to speak

1227
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,800
so what else you got

1228
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,640
i would suggest anything that you know

1229
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,200
you don't use like so we don't use jira

1230
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,280
blacklist

1231
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,359
black list if you don't expect it nuke

1232
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,319
it

1233
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,319
yes

1234
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,680
yeah so that's interesting it's kind of

1235
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,760
like safe links plus plus you know

1236
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,599
there's talking about the evolution i

1237
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,599
think that there's probably some

1238
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,119
products and stuff that will do that

1239
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,359
kind of stuff but i don't know

1240
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,359
i don't uh i don't cook the defenses i

1241
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,920
only eat them

1242
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,560
well i think oh we got some stuff over

1243
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,640
here what she got we'll start with you

1244
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,839
we'll work with you go for it

1245
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,960
um

1246
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,439
good questions

1247
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,200
oh yeah but threat actors

1248
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,560
yeah well threat actors don't care

1249
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,839
that's for sure and that's a good point

1250
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,319
i'm not a lawyer

1251
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,839
say again

1252
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,160
oh yeah so he's talking about liability

1253
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,599
there's liability an end-user license

1254
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,480
agreement not using it nefariously right

1255
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,839
and that's a good point there's there's

1256
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,119
procedural controls in it and then the

1257
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,960
liability of how liable are you because

1258
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,079
your branding is all using it and by the

1259
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,680
way docusign is definitely usable for

1260
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
this

1261
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,119
for sure um i don't know those are good

1262
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,480
questions then that gets into the legal

1263
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,760
legal uh procedural stuff

1264
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,520
i don't know man but that's a good point

1265
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,599
like relying on um you know that that'll

1266
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,359
pro that'll that will defend you from

1267
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,280
pen testers and legal folks

1268
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,160
but not from threat actors

1269
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,400
like most organizations

1270
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,400
that would be dope

1271
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,000
that would be dope

1272
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,200
i think anything that's going to get in

1273
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,800
the way of

1274
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,079
people spending money to sas services

1275
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,280
is going to be a barrier but putting the

1276
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,119
onus on the providers maybe to make it

1277
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,640
so that there's identity verification

1278
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,240
before they like why are they doing all

1279
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,359
this stuff that i could do it for free

1280
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,720
like i did everything i did there i did

1281
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,760
for free

1282
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,079
what you got

1283
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,240
domain age is is a pain in the butt to

1284
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,359
deal with

1285
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,280
but the way around that is just buy 50

1286
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,200
domains and sit on them for a year

1287
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,359
aging like and i do i have

1288
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,040
so many domains and they are aged like a

1289
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,760
fine wine and a fine cheese

1290
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,400
now to your point though the domain age

1291
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,079
checker here's where it gets funky

1292
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,599
sometimes it's like do they check the

1293
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,319
subdomain so like azurewebsites.net

1294
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
that's existed for a while

1295
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,839
but pipefish talk hasn't but some of

1296
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,480
those domain age checkers but then again

1297
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,839
it's defense and death i'm not against

1298
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:28,960
it but i could also spin that up and

1299
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,440
wait six months and then use it

1300
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,839
so all good stuff i think at this point

1301
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,400
love to hear continued discussion on it

1302
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,920
but now i'm going to leave you with this

1303
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,880
and i'm going to ask chris to come up

1304
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,800
here

1305
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,040
organizationally now you've been exposed

1306
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,400
the burden of knowledge is yours it's

1307
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,839
not mine think about for your

1308
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,680
organization what kind of things can you

1309
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,359
do to prevent sas services from being

1310
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,520
abused what you have a risk model now

1311
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,280
that you need to update and think

1312
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,400
through and be like it's not just

1313
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,319
phishing emails from random.com it's

1314
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,400
phishing emails from jira and from

1315
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
atlassian let's say

1316
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,560
from microsoft from docusign do you know

1317
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,319
do you know how many times i've said a

1318
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,839
fake thing for people to sign with

1319
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,839
malware in it through docusign

1320
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,359
not that many times but a couple times

1321
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,800
