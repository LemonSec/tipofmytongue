1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
hey uh good afternoon for one thank you

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
for being here i'm pretty sure i'm

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
competing with this time slot with

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
spinach article artichoke dip so

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,480
you know really i know you guys

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
really are passionate for being here

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,119
um but yeah so let's get into it just a

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
quick who is this guy standing up here

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,160
um so currently the ceo and co-founder

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
of a data security startup named

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,320
failings um we're focused in secure file

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,399
transfers and storage uh but prior to

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,559
that um well part of that i was in

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,399
industry doing so a couple different

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,480
hodgepodge things data science software

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,840
engineering

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,360
and then before that i spent a number of

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,199
years in the military specifically with

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,280
army cyber

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
which i still after active duty one is

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
the reserves um mostly as a cyber

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,879
capabilities developer so you know

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,719
really focus on building all the fun

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,920
tools for

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
people to play around with

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,439
um and then also do a phd research

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,799
focused again kind of

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,200
artificial intelligence cyber so as you

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,760
can tell i'm passionate about it

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,320
so um if you guys want to

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400

so what does this next hour look like

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
talking about the future of cyber

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
security um i got a lot of stats so

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,240
they're not going to try to make it you

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,560
know boring but um it's actually gonna

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
be good picture fodder for you if you

um yeah me so i can uh try to be witty

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,560
and respond

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,959
so first poll of the day

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,038
um actually first poll is how early did

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,640
you think i was going to do a poll but

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
who thinks uh human error is an issue

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,200
see a show of hands

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
all right not not everybody so this

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
might change your mind when you think

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
about how traffic doesn't actually exist

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
and it's just human error over and over

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,000
again

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
it really does piss you off so

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
given that

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,319
who thinks human error is a problem now

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,000
any anyone's mind's changed

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,760
so you know going into like what what

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
are why are we talking about human error

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
specifically cyber security for the most

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
part if you

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
i'll say a survey or talk to a lot of

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,319
cyber security professionals and you

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,160
mentioned that you know how bad how bad

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
are your users you know how bad is human

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,400
error people generally agree that hey

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
there's a problem here but you know what

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,760
i'm going to talk about over the next

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
course of the next 40 minutes or so

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,599
is that really we're not spending enough

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,800
time focusing on solving for that um so

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
you know again why is this important um

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,959
this is focused a lot on you know

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,480
healthcare data but for the most part

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
this is applicable across all industries

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
um

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,360
but picked healthcare because you know

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
for when we spend a lot of time talking

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
to healthcare professionals security

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
professionals um and healthcare is the

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,319
most expensive type of data breach out

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,799
there so yeah we'll go that into some

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,879
cost centers on like why healthcare is

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,280
so expensive but as of you know on

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
average is the most expensive type of

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,040
data breach um

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
and uh this is a little um

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,879
not maybe not the awards you want to win

100
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,799
but healthcare has topped uh for the

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,879
last 11 consecutive years

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
topped as the highest cost in data

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
breaches so you know for over a decade

104
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,319
now

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,280
it continues to be very expensive so

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
where are we in terms of the you know

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
state of the breach

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
it continues to go up and it's not

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,920
because of inflation there's just more

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
and more data out there and therefore

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,159
there's more and more data to be stolen

112
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,159
um the average cost of a data breach you

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
know as you can see i highlighted it

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
it's increased nearly 10 percent year

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,560
over year that's from 2020 to 2021. um

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
we're only halfway through 2022 but you

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,639
know what we're seeing is that trend is

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
going to continue on um

119
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
and and last year or 2020 to 2021 was

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
the largest single year cost increase um

121
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
in the last seven years so again we're

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,040
not seeing this pace slow down at all

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
we're actually seeing it get getting

124
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
worse um so you might ask yourself what

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
kind of data is actually getting stolen

126
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,759
because you know when people say

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,720
information data it's a very

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,199
ambiguous term so what actually is being

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
stolen is a customer pii for the most

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
part um so customer pii patient data you

131
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
know that's all very uh

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
interesting data to breach and there's

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,000
actually a

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,040
per per record cost so it's about 180 as

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
of today um for each patient or you know

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,960
customer pii data that gets out there um

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
and that's again that's up 30 dollars

138
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
from just just a couple years ago

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,280
and then so another question is why now

140
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,800
it's like hasn't data breach has always

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,759
been a problem um you know for one yes

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
but for two if you think about it you

143
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,199
know right now with the remote work with

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,960
kovid um

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
or because of covet in 2020 you know a

146
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
lot of organizations moved to remote

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,720
work and they weren't ready for that and

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
at the end of the day you know they had

149
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,840
built a lot of systems that are based

150
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
off of a you know perimeter but all of a

151
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
sudden you have a workforce that's you

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
know working at their house

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
but maybe working at a coffee shop

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
especially now that you know things are

155
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,400
getting better from a pandemic

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
standpoint you know you're going to see

157
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
a lot more people on workcations

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
working you know all over the world so

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
you know depending on what kind of wi-fi

160
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
they're connected to and all that it

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,919
causes a lot of attack vectors now um so

162
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,320
it's really just without adapting to

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
that um

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
it just opens organizations up for a lot

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
of different ways to get breached um so

166
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
and there's actually numbers associated

167
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
with this which is pretty cool so the

168
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,400
1.07 million dollar uh difference in

169
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
data breaches um collected over you know

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
seeing if their remote work was a factor

171
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,880
versus not a factor so um i don't know

172
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
about you phalanx doesn't particularly

173
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,160
have an extra million dollars lying

174
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
around in the case of a data breach um

175
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,360
to deal with remote work but you know

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
it'd be a lot cheaper to just

177
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
implement security uh features to to

178
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
work around it

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
so

180
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,400
here's another poll

181
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
whose organization experienced some sort

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
of data breach in the last three years

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,240
we've got a couple awesome

184
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
so we have a follow-up poll

185
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,039
who of those people who had their

186
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
organization experienced a data breach

187
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,639
who's in the healthcare industry

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,080
looks like we got we got a winner yes

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,639
so here's a fun fact

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,880
more than 93 percent of healthcare

191
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
organizations have experienced a data

192
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
breach in the past three years

193
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
just out of curiosity is anyone in the

194
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
healthcare

195
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
in a healthcare organization in here

196
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,919
that didn't get breached in the last

197
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
three years

198
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,199
uh

199
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,800
i guess no so hey 93 is really high

200
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,759
um

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,280
so yeah again getting more expensive

202
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
it's up a couple million dollars than it

203
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,199
was a couple years ago and at the end of

204
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,560
the day you know that this is a double

205
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
than the global average of a data breach

206
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,639
cost so it's just getting more expensive

207
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
healthcare continues to be a very

208
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,280
profitable business to attack um and the

209
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
more profitable it is the more it

210
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,560
becomes a um focus so

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
you know you're wondering maybe

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
you know what what's some more reasons

213
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
why healthcare is a big target um is

214
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,280
hipaa involved so the short answer is

215
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,360
yes so 50 50 000 is the number of um

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
what a hipaa violation could cost you um

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,440
you know it couldn't cost

218
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
as little as little as a hundred dollars

219
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,199
but

220
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,720
you know fifty thousand dollars is is

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
not cheap for smaller organizations a

222
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,479
health tech company you know that's the

223
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,520
kind of thing that could put you out of

224
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
business if you're a small business um

225
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,479
400 about 400 000 the average hipaa

226
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,800
penalty cost in 2021. again this is

227
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
these aren't small numbers for smaller

228
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,639
organizations even for a large hospital

229
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
system i'm sure you know they're not

230
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
looking to spend um half a million

231
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,720
dollars because of this hipaa violations

232
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,199
and then post breach response is the uh

233
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
one of the biggest issues with or one of

234
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
the biggest cost centers associated with

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
with a hipaa breach in particular

236
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
so you know talking about

237
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
the cost centers

238
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
i wanted to spend a little time just to

239
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
break down like again not everyone's had

240
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,958
experience with uh paying for a breach

241
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,120
hopefully but if you're looking if you

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,719
have been what we're looking at is this

243
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,640
is the breakdown of

244
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,399
uh where the where the costs are

245
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
associated with so 29

246
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,440
um is actually just you know of the cost

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,040
is trying to figure out what happened

248
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
what got breached um part of hipaa

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,640
actually should have included this

250
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
graphic but part of hipaa is if the file

251
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
or if the data was encrypted then there

252
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
was no breach but if there if it wasn't

253
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
encrypted then there's a number of steps

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
you have to take to determine

255
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
if a breach even occurred and what got

256
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,320
breached

257
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,680
so that's actually really interesting

258
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,519
because if you think about it

259
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,279
organizations have to pay for data

260
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,240
breaches

261
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
pay for more data than was actually

262
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,399
truly breached because they don't know

263
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
what exactly was breach so part of that

264
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,959
again

265
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,480
detection escalation um 38 seems kind of

266
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,720
obvious but in terms of what it is but

267
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
lost business so you know what can go

268
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,839
into that is

269
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
um even uh or people just not trusting

270
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,640
your organization anymore so

271
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
um

272
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,279
there was a target breach a number of

273
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
years ago that actually affected their

274
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
sales after that because people were

275
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
like well i don't use my credit card at

276
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,680
target um if it's just going to get you

277
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
know on the dark way afterwards so in

278
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
addition to

279
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
uh not trusting your organization and

280
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
and distrust and obviously um let's say

281
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,519
it's a ransomware attack and things are

282
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,120
shut down then at that point you know

283
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
there's nothing you can do

284
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,079
um business-wise until you fix that um

285
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,680
six percent notification and that's just

286
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
letting people know that their data was

287
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
out there um pretty sure

288
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
quick side poll again has anyone not

289
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
received a letter

290
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,120
ever that that says your data has been

291
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,000
breached and we're paying for a year of

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
sir

293
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,279
wow

294
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,560
i hope

295
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
keep that streak going

296
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,000
um

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,079
that's amazing okay so one day

298
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,160
you may receive in the mail

299
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
a letter that says your data has been

300
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,800
reached x y and z like could have even

301
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
been four years actually this happened

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
recently i was talking to somebody

303
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,120
um

304
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
they had gone to the hospital four years

305
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,240
ago um and they received a letter this

306
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
week that said their their data was just

307
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
breached but because their data was

308
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,880
sitting in a database um four years ago

309
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,120
that data left too so you know pretty

310
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
much what you get is a year of

311
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,959
monitoring so

312
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,880
that's the the consolation prize for

313
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
having your data out there um

314
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,200
but anyway so six percent of the cost is

315
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
associated with that kind of

316
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
notification and then 27 percent again

317
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
the post uh post breach responses

318
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
and that's just dealing with the

319
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,360
aftermath of a breach whether it be um

320
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
settlements or you know even like

321
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,760
additional controls that kind of

322
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,839
knee-jerk reaction of oh we lost all

323
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
this data maybe we should fire our ciso

324
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,959
and go buy a dlp tool um which

325
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,880
we all know is not gonna be worth any

326
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
money um

327
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,920
so anyway so the best way to kind of

328
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
walk through this wanted to walk through

329
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
an example right so

330
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,959
um we have a real company using it this

331
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,560
is a real

332
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,240
scenario that happened um fake name uh

333
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
but i didn't try too hard to make it

334
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
fake so if you know this organization

335
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,079
uh i just shortened it down to m so for

336
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,720
their privacy's sake um

337
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,440
so anyway hopefully none of you are from

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
mhealth

339
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,560
uh so anyway we're going to walk through

340
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,600
kind of a data breach at mhealth see how

341
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,480
that went through for them um

342
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,839
you know see how the effect of that

343
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
cyber breach can have on a health

344
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
organization um and then you know to

345
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
kind of talk through what went wrong

346
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,120
and um spoiler alert

347
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,959
people went wrong

348
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,839
so

349
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,800
uh

350
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
backstory what what happened what

351
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,160
alerted the organization how do they

352
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
even know the breach a breach occurred

353
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,120
um so they actually got a missed payment

354
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
so they're like huh well that's strange

355
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,079
um if they're i guess a vendor i got a

356
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,279
missed payment so the vendor was like

357
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,480
hey you know there's something wrong

358
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,639
here um

359
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,040
so they're like hey by the way m health

360
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
um there

361
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,839
is a is a missed payment and this is a

362
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
july of 2021 so this is a pretty recent

363
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
less than a year ago uh event so mhealth

364
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,959
of course is like well we got to now go

365
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,279
figure out if a breach or what what is

366
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,200
going on right now so

367
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,360
again not kind of not surprising here is

368
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,760
a uh

369
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,560
sorry

370
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
is a business email compromise so what

371
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
happened was a their vendor

372
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
contractor had a business email

373
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
compromise and it was actually several

374
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,279
threat actors got in so it was kind of a

375
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,000
party in there so to speak um pretty

376
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,839
much everyone but maybe the contractor

377
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,560
was was producing those emails

378
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,399
and then they were able to essentially

379
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,120
use that uh compromised email as a way

380
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,839
to fish other people to get you know

381
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,040
work through the organization

382
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
essentially being able to

383
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
legitimize themselves with that email

384
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
account because it's coming from a

385
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,600
actual

386
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,120
email from that organization so

387
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,279
the infamous supply chain tax so gg

388
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
this is another case of a supply chain

389
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,120
attack which is annoying obviously for

390
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,639
all of us as

391
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,480
you can spend all the money in the world

392
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
securing your

393
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
uh your organization especially if

394
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,920
you're using a perimeter-based system um

395
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,639
or architecture and if your vendors get

396
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,360
hacked then and they have your data then

397
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
there's kind of nothing you can do about

398
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,079
it

399
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:02,959
so

400
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,320
speaking of gg supply chain attack

401
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
another poll so i don't know if that's

402
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,040
like a dated reference is gigi still

403
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,760
cool do people still use gg

404
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
looks like i'm getting zero

405
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,959
all right is there

406
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,920
oh no we got one we got two

407
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
um

408
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,079
so

409
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,079
uh i wanted to also translate this for

410
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,800
our gen z folk um

411
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,360
which i believe would be

412
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,880
does gigi still slap no cap

413
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,600
if that helps

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
all right so

415
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,199
i'm kind of going more into you know how

416
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,360
did this attack occur walking through

417
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
the data breach itself so

418
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
again that uh the contractor's email was

419
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,279
compromised threat actors were able to

420
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,519
use those emails to legitimize

421
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,040
themselves

422
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,279
and then perform more phishing attacks

423
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,040
so uh they were able they were able to

424
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
fish for over three months of again kind

425
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,160
of honestly i'd very curious about the

426
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
contractor who i don't know if they like

427
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
looked into their send box and was like

428
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,079
oh hey look there's a bunch of emails

429
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,279
asking for a bunch of sketchy

430
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,480
information

431
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
that i don't remember sending who knows

432
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,240
maybe they just don't do a lot of work

433
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
on their email um

434
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
but anyway so the the compromise

435
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,040
accounts that they ended up getting

436
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
through those phishing attacks had

437
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,360
patient information that were included

438
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
and um you know again employee data for

439
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
mhealth too so in this case they were

440
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,240
able to steal not just only uh you know

441
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,639
customer pii patient data but also

442
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
employee data which they can you know

443
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
obviously use and sell but they can also

444
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,600
use that to perpetrate more attacks so

445
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
they can use

446
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
pretty much as mhealth as a vendor to

447
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,639
other organizations they can jump across

448
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,399
even more organizations because they

449
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,759
have a legitimate employee data

450
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,160
so looking into the aftermath of what

451
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,600
this attack cost so it's a 7 million

452
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
average you know the average cost again

453
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
using the 180

454
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,240
um

455
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,279
pii

456
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,440
7 million dollars like that's not cheap

457
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,920
again not a lot of organizations uh

458
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,279
small businesses don't have that lying

459
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,079
around just waiting for a settlement um

460
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,079
the hipaa violations alone were almost

461
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,000
four million dollars of that and and

462
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
again um

463
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,279
part of that goes into the

464
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,959
post breach response

465
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,279
again was the highest part of that

466
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,639
payment wise sixty percent um

467
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,040
same for uh and then the most the other

468
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,360
was uh the detection and escalation

469
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
again just paying for

470
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,639
or the money involved and just figuring

471
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
out what data got breached

472
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,720
and having to pay for the ones that they

473
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
couldn't prove that wasn't breached

474
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,880
again seven million dollars is is pretty

475
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,320
pricey for

476
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
a supply chain attack so

477
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
what is

478
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
the leading cause of breaches

479
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
we got a people guess we got any other

480
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,800
guesses

481
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,240
attacker man

482
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,880
no i'm kidding

483
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,599
it's hackerman let's just call it a day

484
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,119
no um

485
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,760
yes so people human error not surprising

486
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,520
um and it's something that we've all um

487
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,359
you know all have experienced and dealt

488
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,880
with so

489
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
basic and it's not even you know big

490
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,319
you know massively orchestrated attacks

491
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,959
or you know massive errors on a

492
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,240
employee's fault but it's just like

493
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
really basic small things that add up

494
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
and and open up um your organization to

495
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
to to have different attack factors um

496
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,160
and it's been the same issue for

497
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
for who knows how many years um

498
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,080
but really interestingly if you think

499
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
about like again kind of like so human

500
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,640
error is

501
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,320
not very specific what what are some of

502
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,679
the human errors that are causing these

503
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,480
problems

504
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
obviously you know phishing is you know

505
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,440
being not being able to determine a

506
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,720
phishing email again that's probably the

507
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
most common that people think about but

508
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
missed delivery 36 percent of errors is

509
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
mis-delivery

510
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
and that's just i i accidentally sent

511
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,360
you data that you shouldn't see um and

512
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,039
obviously that is it's actually pretty

513
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,200
scary if you think about that 36 percent

514
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,600
of data breaches if somebody just didn't

515
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
pay attention who they sent the data to

516
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
um indexes yeah publishing errors and

517
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
misconfiguration again that's pretty

518
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
pretty scary and sometimes out of your

519
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,160
control so there's a case of microsoft

520
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
um for one drive so

521
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
there's a person who logs into their

522
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
corporate onedrive account and they

523
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
notice that all the files were not their

524
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,280
company's files but just another

525
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,919
company's files um and what happened was

526
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,400
on the server side of microsoft somebody

527
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
did some sort of uh misconfiguration on

528
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,320
the policy and yeah they just like

529
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
just were showing other people other

530
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,880
people's data so i don't think that

531
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
actually resulted in any stolen or lost

532
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,000
data from a breach perspective but um

533
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
very well could have been right so it's

534
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,039
really

535
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,240
um

536
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,600
especially now we're moving more into

537
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
like cloud services it's hard to say

538
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
that we control our own data when

539
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,640
something like that could happen

540
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,760
and then the

541
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
the next one after that is a web

542
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,240
application attack so that one

543
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,320
you guys have know all about web app

544
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
attacks so we will go too deep into that

545
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
so how bad is human error

546
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,000
again fishing not surprising there but

547
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
it is on top continues to be a problem

548
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,880
there is not enough fishing education

549
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,520
out in the world to stop people from

550
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,320
just clicking the thing i mean and again

551
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
this isn't a security professionals get

552
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,679
it right all the time

553
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,200
i've clicked some scheduling links

554
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,039
sometimes and and it fell uh victim to

555
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,520
an internal corporate phishing campaign

556
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
to like suss people out so you know it's

557
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,240
like

558
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
it happens sometimes you're tired not

559
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,400
really paying attention like you know it

560
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
it happened like human error happened so

561
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,559
instead of trying to

562
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,240
wipe away the fact that it happens you

563
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,000
know we really need to start focus on

564
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
and um you know addressing it and

565
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,559
acknowledging that it is and how do we

566
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,120
help people to not um

567
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
not do this kind of thing so again

568
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
humans are the problem

569
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
with two r's um

570
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,840
unintentional but hey human error

571
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,440
right if that two r's was me

572
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
accidentally typing someone's name wrong

573
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
and sending some data to a different

574
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
email account that would have been a

575
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,520
data breach um and then and even with

576
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,640
ransomware uh 13 of that deals you know

577
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
has some sort of human related aspect to

578
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,520
it

579
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,559
um

580
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,080
so again we're digging deeper a little

581
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,480
bit like what is what is human error

582
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,799
really costing us um at the end of the

583
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,640
day you know from a business perspective

584
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,559
a lot of business owners that's you know

585
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,679
the bottom line right that's what

586
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
matters to them but at the end of the

587
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
day if you can quantify how much human

588
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,039
error costs it piques a lot of people's

589
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,039
interest so business email compromise

590
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,520
continue to be the most expensive type

591
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,039
of data they're not the most common but

592
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,039
they're the most expensive

593
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,919
and the most the reason why is that

594
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,400
a lot of people again sometimes myself

595
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,520
included

596
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
use our emails like a

597
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,559
ghost file server

598
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,200
so that's not good

599
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
so let's say you're you know you're

600
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,720
sending these massive excel files uh

601
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,799
full of all kinds of data even if it

602
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,960
stays within um you know within your

603
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,559
organization not even including the fact

604
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,520
that people are emailing themselves um

605
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,960
to their personal accounts you know

606
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,400
corporate information

607
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
but yeah those things just sit there

608
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,840
unless you're cleaning out your inbox

609
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
all the time um

610
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
there could be years of files in

611
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
people's emails um just sitting there

612
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
could be breached and

613
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,159
yeah so just ghost uh file server so

614
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,640
um yeah there's not

615
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
who does not

616
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,919
like send

617
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
attachments and or who deletes

618
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
attachments all the time when you send

619
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
and receive

620
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,679
um

621
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,200
i don't think anyone because it's

622
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
burdensome right like that's just that's

623
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,200
just the way it is um but yeah looking

624
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,039
at so five a five million dollar average

625
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,640
on the business email compromises and

626
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,720
again that's because if you think about

627
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
data

628
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,240
like pii as a per pii record cost and

629
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
you know who knows how many like

630
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
again excel files pdfs

631
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
and it's like not even including when

632
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,880
people just straight up like put social

633
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,840
security numbers in the email um

634
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,280
but yeah i mean if you even think about

635
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,799
like uh for you know if you're buying a

636
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,080
house or your accountant they're just

637
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,440
like hey just shoot me all this stuff

638
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
with your you know all kinds of

639
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
sensitive information and you're like

640
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
you just want me to email that to you

641
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
and they usually

642
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
sometimes they have a a data room but a

643
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,559
lot of times they're just like no you

644
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,360
just just send it it's fine um

645
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720
it's not fine

646
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,840
but

647
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,360
yeah so going

648
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,960
going into like what is the real

649
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,919
fundamental issue here um and it's the

650
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,480
clash between security and you know

651
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
generally what we as humans are trying

652
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
to do with our lives

653
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,840
even security professionals

654
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,400
our job is isn't to

655
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,120
do the secure practices it's to try to

656
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
secure the organization so again

657
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
requirements versus security uh human

658
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
error really deals with the fact that

659
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,080
um those are just fundamentally two

660
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
different things when people are trying

661
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
to do their job trying to be productive

662
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,520
it's counter to

663
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,120
doing a secure

664
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,600
excuse me a secure reaction it's at the

665
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
end of the day if it's between doing

666
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,280
something for your job and doing the

667
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,360
right thing from a security perspective

668
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,039
um often people are like well i'm not

669
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
getting paid to make security decisions

670
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,360
i'm getting paid to do my job and again

671
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
like the best you can get is security

672
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
conscious people who are like let me try

673
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,320
to do the right thing but you know there

674
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,760
is always a you know there's a point

675
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,480
where where people break on that so

676
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
given that

677
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,520
we're gonna play

678
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,960
a little game

679
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,159
um

680
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,919
and it's gonna be a pull-based game so

681
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,360
pretty much what we're about to do is

682
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,120
we're gonna walk through a number of

683
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
scenarios of

684
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,559
would you rather

685
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,279
uh you know would you rather

686
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,120
if you did this security decision and a

687
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,000
negative um implication of it so we're

688
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,840
gonna start easy

689
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
so who would do what's right from a per

690
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,919
security perspective

691
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,000
but you'd lose your job so would you do

692
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
the right thing security wise knowing

693
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
that you'd lose your job if you did it

694
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,799
who would who would do it

695
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,640
we got one we got a couple all right you

696
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,799
know

697
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,060
[Laughter]

698
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,520
if you

699
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,039
if you uh don't do it you might lose

700
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,559
your job

701
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
um but yeah i mean it's tough right it's

702
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
like hey you know doing the right thing

703
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
protecting corporate's data

704
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,679
uh what if you lose your job doing it

705
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,440
like at the end of the day it's not your

706
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,000
data it's their data but it's your job

707
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
so it's interesting um so here we go

708
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,360
we're gonna walk it down a little bit

709
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
who would do you know would you do a

710
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,720
security perspective but uh do the right

711
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,919
thing from the security perspective but

712
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,000
you get a bad reputation so let's say

713
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
um that's good you honest people i love

714
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
it um because you know at the end of the

715
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,279
day

716
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,080
not

717
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
everyone

718
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
values uh privacy or security so you

719
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,919
know there's a time where if doing the

720
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,240
right thing does make you you know a bad

721
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,120
person um but it's tough

722
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,440
so let's get a little bit more

723
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,600
loose with it how about you do what's

724
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,360
right but you're like late on a deadline

725
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,678
all right

726
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,720
and what about you are about to like

727
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,120
it's either you do the security thing or

728
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,400
you don't do the security thing you're

729
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,799
gonna miss your flight so who would

730
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,240
i realize i didn't reward these as great

731
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
but who is willing to not do the

732
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
security thing to not miss their flight

733
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,159
or i guess or do the security thing and

734
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,679
miss their flight

735
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,000
we got we got a couple but i mean if you

736
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,799
think about it like again good good on

737
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,480
you guys but just

738
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,919
you know we're at a security conference

739
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,240
if i ask this to non-security people

740
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,600
imagine what these answers would be

741
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,480
vacation vacation flight

742
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,480
this is

743
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,000
this is your

744
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,080
so you've been running

745
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,000
you've been running these security apps

746
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,960
for

747
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,080
a full year straight 16-hour days seven

748
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
days a week and this is finally your

749
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,159
your two-week vacation that you're going

750
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:02,880
on

751
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
and if you miss this it's you're going

752
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,480
to like australia or something it's

753
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,640
gonna take you like 36 hours so if you

754
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,200
miss this flight it's a big deal who's

755
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,080
missing the flight

756
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,640
all right so here's i think the last one

757
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,840
um

758
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,919
and again this it feels easy to say

759
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,200
like i'll do the right thing from a

760
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,640
security perspective

761
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
and stay a little late on a friday night

762
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
um so who would who's willing to do that

763
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
yeah so that's good a lot of hands i'm

764
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
glad i'm glad as especially as a lot of

765
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
security professionals in this room i'm

766
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
glad you're willing to stay a little

767
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,799
late on friday and do the right thing um

768
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,799
but again like if we're if we're asking

769
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,400
this to a crowd of people that aren't

770
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,320
security conscious aren't security

771
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
professionals don't care don't care

772
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,679
about you know the corporate security

773
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,480
per se um this actually becomes this is

774
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
this is like the the crux of the issue

775
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
right like the people

776
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,279
in

777
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,360
and again if they're honestly if you

778
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,679
tell them if you ask them in corporate

779
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,360
training then people go yes i'll do the

780
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,919
right thing but you know honestly do

781
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,120
people do the wrong

782
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,720
do do the right thing when they all the

783
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,760
time like

784
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
and again there's like who knows like

785
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,880
let's say it's do the right thing from a

786
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,000
security perspective or

787
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,640
like i need to go pick up my kids or

788
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
like i'm gonna be you know late to

789
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,679
something else big or some something

790
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,880
negative is going to happen to me in my

791
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,039
personal life right so it's like that

792
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,080
the more

793
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,919
people there are the more

794
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,440
exceptions to the role there are and

795
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,760
there's always room for you know that

796
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
gap between what is right from security

797
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,559
and what just people living their lives

798
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,760
and that's where the human error comes

799
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,799
in

800
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,600
so

801
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,720
and another issue with uh cyber security

802
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,399
or with the human error is the shadow

803
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,440
i.t right so like we all love to think

804
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,240
about and oftentimes talk about um i

805
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,120
don't know if

806
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,880
for all the security certifications out

807
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,480
there one of the if you've ever gone to

808
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,760
a boot camp for them one of the first

809
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,960
things they always tell you is don't

810
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,080
think about

811
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,679
they're like these certifications will

812
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,720
be harder for people with more

813
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
experience because you're gonna know

814
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,200
you're gonna think about what really

815
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,039
happens and you're getting tested on

816
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,480
what the ideal

817
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,600
should happen

818
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,559
um

819
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,039
and the reality is you know shadow i.t

820
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,720
exists because

821
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
oftentimes organizations start with a

822
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,799
security control and push that out to

823
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,919
people but they don't really think about

824
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,360
like how do people actually operate on a

825
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,799
day-to-day basis

826
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,840
um

827
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,360
so you know again they're they're

828
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,679
they'll use unapproved tools they'll use

829
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
um you know maybe like google drive

830
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,679
personal accounts personal emails

831
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,120
anything that just kind of make it make

832
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,720
their day lives easier because you know

833
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,159
at the end of the day again it's

834
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,799
security decision versus

835
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,399
getting the job done for what i'm

836
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,559
getting paid for to get a paycheck so

837
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,799
again like those two don't usually play

838
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,960
nice together and the harder you make

839
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
the security side

840
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
the harder they're going to try to

841
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,480
bypass that

842
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,320
so instead of just pretending it doesn't

843
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,919
exist i think we should really just

844
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,640
focus on and embrace the reality the

845
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,039
shadow i.t is a thing and instead of

846
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,559
trying to tell people to do the right

847
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,399
thing again instead of if if you're

848
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,159
relying on your users to do the right

849
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:02,960
thing

850
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,360
that's a it's a losing battle

851
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,679
like you can't you can't know 100 right

852
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,679
so that again part of what you know we

853
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,720
need to be doing is focus on um

854
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,799
addressing and embracing that this stuff

855
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,120
exists um and really try to think about

856
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,320
you know start at the human layer and

857
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
build security on top of that like what

858
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
are people actually doing are people

859
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,480
using their personal accounts how do we

860
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,559
make like what is the problem that

861
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,760
they're using their personal accounts

862
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
for that our you know organization isn't

863
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,440
supplying them from a productivity

864
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
standpoint so if you if you really start

865
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,840
with that build security around that and

866
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,640
then

867
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,399
and then you know these shadow it issues

868
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,520
will go away because at the end of the

869
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,159
day people don't want to make a negative

870
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,039
security decision they want to just do

871
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,399
their job and go home you know it's like

872
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,679
at the end of the day that's that's what

873
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
they want to do they're not trying to

874
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,880
open your organization up to um well

875
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
insider threat is a different thing but

876
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
for the average employee isn't actively

877
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,600
trying to hinder the organization

878
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,559
um

879
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,240
but actually that last point if you look

880
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,039
at it the uh the more risks so that's

881
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,600
actually a really interesting uh stat

882
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,240
right so like uh 54 of it teams

883
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,919
considered themselves more at risk

884
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,559
of a data breach after code 19 and in

885
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,840
the remote work and all the policy

886
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,760
changes that went along with it so if

887
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,600
you think about that like

888
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,240
things are getting worse

889
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,320
but they don't have to be but if we're

890
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
not addressing it and we're just trying

891
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
to operate in the same day-to-day that

892
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,760
we were doing um back when perimeter

893
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,240
security was fine then it's you're just

894
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,120
gonna have a bad time

895
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,000
so

896
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,039
um

897
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,880
what are we doing about it

898
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,240
today

899
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,279
um

900
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,679
honestly that number one one is is

901
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,880
probably the number one uh

902
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
knee-jerk reaction that organizations

903
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
have in the in the state of a breach

904
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
they say uh-oh we got breached probably

905
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,360
with a phishing attack um what are we

906
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,679
going to do about it oh let's

907
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,640
run

908
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,159
simulated phishing attacks against our

909
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,559
employees let's have them sit through an

910
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,000
hour of training on how not to get

911
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,080
phished and let's keep doing that over

912
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,480
and over and over again and

913
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,840
maybe it won't happen but all it takes

914
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,399
is that one person to forget to do it

915
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,240
click on the thing be a little tired

916
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,519
less vigilant you know it's like there's

917
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,360
all kinds of things and it

918
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,840
education is very important but

919
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,000
isn't the be all end-all and shouldn't

920
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,600
be the only thing an organization is

921
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,320
doing to combat human error

922
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,679
not to mention

923
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,120
getting high quality um cyber education

924
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,039
is is difficult right so it's it's hard

925
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,200
to be able to distill it down so that

926
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
your everyday users and employees um

927
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,519
it's meaningful to them and it's not

928
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,480
just you know just a joke to them um and

929
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,640
worse off it's actually hard to also get

930
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,880
uh education that isn't isn't fishing

931
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,960
focus right so at the end of the day you

932
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
know it it's like how do we find more

933
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,919
ways to engage people and teach them um

934
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,240
you know more about security and and

935
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,080
less about just specifically like please

936
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,880
stop clicking links um

937
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,320
and yeah

938
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,840
the second one is what i was mentioning

939
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,960
earlier

940
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,640
like what do we what are we doing we

941
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,039
keep just tightening the controls even

942
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,720
though that's the problem the problem is

943
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,640
tight controls so people bypass it with

944
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,760
shadow i.t

945
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
and then there's a breach

946
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
and then we tighten down the controls

947
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,640
even more so that there can be less of a

948
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,159
thing and then so people find another

949
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,080
way around that and it's just a game of

950
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,240
cat and mouse if we keep approaching it

951
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,880
by saying hey let's lock let's lock it

952
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,080
down and make it hard for people to do

953
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,360
their jobs

954
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,679
so more policies more controls that's

955
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,519
not not helping but that's what a lot of

956
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,200
people do because again it's a knee-jerk

957
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
reaction of what how do we solve this

958
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,559
problem let's do so by uh like let me

959
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,480
let's go just buy some stuff like

960
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,760
if we talk to some sisters like that

961
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,360
they're just like you know frazzled and

962
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,480
they're like i don't i just let's just

963
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
get some things let's

964
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,000
let's say that we're doing more

965
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,720
more work um but at the end of the day

966
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,399
you know if especially if it's policy

967
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,760
based um

968
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,880
controls

969
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,039
that's a lot of hours that's a lot of

970
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,799
time

971
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,360
my co-co-founder and i spoke to assisto

972
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,320
that

973
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
had purchased like a million dollars of

974
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,760
dlp that's just been sitting on the

975
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,440
shelf for like nine months because he's

976
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,360
like yeah i just don't have the time to

977
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,519
have my team put it in place yet he's

978
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,640
like i know i'm pretty sure i'm gonna

979
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,039
hate it once i'm done with it but i

980
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,039
paid for it so i need to

981
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,960
like eventually do it first before i

982
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,799
look at more solutions but i mean that's

983
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,640
a huge problem right that's super

984
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,120
expensive that's um

985
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
just going to create uh actually what

986
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,720
it's going to end up doing also is talk

987
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,559
to another sister that

988
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,039
was was saying that he

989
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,000
just

990
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,919
any any of these policy-based systems

991
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,200
just create um exceptions in terms of

992
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
it's like an exception mill so it's like

993
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
and he's he's at a health system and he

994
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,919
says like pretty much they put into

995
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,760
control that requires these policies and

996
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,320
the next day they get a bunch of their

997
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,480
doctors that are like you know what like

998
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
i get it i get it you know that's an

999
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,399
important control but i

1000
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,919
it shouldn't apply to me

1001
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,440
and then so you know that happens every

1002
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,039
single so they make a exception for them

1003
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,320
they make another exception for them and

1004
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,719
then that goes around opens up some more

1005
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,480
issues and holes so they build some more

1006
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
policies around that to try to fix that

1007
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,960
and then it just becomes a huge mess um

1008
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,719
so tighter controls more policies not

1009
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,918
working for us

1010
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,599
uh that's not what we should be doing

1011
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,359
more of so

1012
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,399
what should we be doing um what is the

1013
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,280
future of cyber security um look like

1014
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,520
what are like what how do we adapt and

1015
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
evolve to you know the growing threats

1016
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,159
and our change in work environments and

1017
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,320
productivity so

1018
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,399
you know the number one bullet point

1019
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,599
right there it's like reduce the number

1020
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,119
of security decisions that people need

1021
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,760
to make because again if you're leaving

1022
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,399
it up to the end user to make the right

1023
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,079
decision 100 of the time then you're

1024
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,440
going to be

1025
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
disappointed

1026
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,800
pretty much the entire time because

1027
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,040
again there's that fundamental rub

1028
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,440
between that security decision and what

1029
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,599
their goals are so if we reduce the

1030
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,000
number of security decisions they make

1031
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,839
um you know through automation through

1032
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,640
anything else uh that'll help make it so

1033
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,800
that when they do have to ultimately

1034
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
make a security decision you know

1035
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,480
they're not burned out on it they're

1036
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,160
willing to think a little bit more and

1037
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,599
you know you've made their lives easier

1038
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,240
for 90 of the way you know they're like

1039
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,920
a little more likely to do the right

1040
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,760
thing on that last 10 percent

1041
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,720
um

1042
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
next thing kind of tied directly into

1043
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
that you need to focus on the

1044
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,240
inefficiencies and particularly the the

1045
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,760
human factor right so instead of

1046
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
starting with the control pushing it

1047
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,599
down to the people start with the people

1048
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,680
figure out what are people doing

1049
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
why are they trying to you know use

1050
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
their personal accounts why are they

1051
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,359
passing through things through google

1052
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,960
drive why are they doing this why are

1053
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
they doing that and you'll find that

1054
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
there is a there there will be a

1055
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,079
productivity

1056
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,040
um

1057
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,560
issue that the company isn't addressing

1058
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,240
and causing that so again instead of

1059
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,320
saying well you're bad you shouldn't do

1060
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,440
that sit through another hour of

1061
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,040
training it's like hey let's actually

1062
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,640
provide you a tool

1063
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
that solves your problem and does so in

1064
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,599
a way that ultimately does what we want

1065
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,280
which is

1066
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,520
a higher security uh posture because of

1067
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,320
it so

1068
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
instead of saying hey let's put a

1069
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,920
control in another policy and it's like

1070
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,560
let's let me buy you a security focus

1071
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,800
productivity tool and use that instead

1072
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
of doing what you're doing and hopefully

1073
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,560
and ideally that makes your life even

1074
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,720
easier than running your stuff through a

1075
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,440
chain of shadow i.t um

1076
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,119
and speaking of that going to

1077
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,560
acknowledge the fact that shadow t

1078
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,480
exists um the more you ignore it the

1079
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
more you it's same with the remote work

1080
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
so organizations that

1081
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
aren't embracing it in terms of just

1082
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,240
acknowledging that it's happening like

1083
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,960
people are working remotely even if

1084
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,880
that's not the company's policy right

1085
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,160
like people go home and do work um and

1086
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
for sure if it is a company's policy but

1087
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,440
when it's not and that's actually where

1088
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,520
the shadow it comes from right so if you

1089
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,359
aren't embracing that in this day and

1090
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,160
age people will find a way to get to

1091
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,680
make it to make it work because at the

1092
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,200
end of the day you know a lot of people

1093
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,119
are just trying to do their jobs and the

1094
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,040
more security gets in the way of that

1095
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,920
the more shadow i.t exists but if we

1096
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,560
just try to say hey don't use your

1097
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,480
personal accounts here's a training for

1098
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,079
not using your personal accounts it's

1099
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,400
never gonna be solved um

1100
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,240
and then again embrace just embrace that

1101
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
remote work is a thing even if the

1102
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,640
company's policy isn't a remote work

1103
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,119
policy make sure you have a way for

1104
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,160
people to

1105
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,599
to safely

1106
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,160
work remotely so you know a lot of that

1107
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,880
was

1108
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,200
hey we have a vpn it's like okay so what

1109
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
else are you doing to protect your data

1110
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
as it sits outside of your office

1111
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,200
perimeter

1112
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,680
last one there automation so don't

1113
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,880
you dare

1114
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,680
buy anything that says ai in it until

1115
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,320
you've fully automated things

1116
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
don't even

1117
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,839
bother with the ai stuff until you've

1118
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,040
automated things because at the end of

1119
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
the day against

1120
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,440
solving what the issue is is a

1121
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
productivity issue

1122
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,800
so being able to automate past security

1123
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
decisions being able to automate why

1124
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,280
people are um doing the wrong thing you

1125
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,000
know bring more automation do peop

1126
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,480
if you want people to do something

1127
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
the more you can just do it for them you

1128
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,839
know they'll accept it people are

1129
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,800
willing to accept a security

1130
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
decision that happened upon them versus

1131
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,880
making that decision so again automation

1132
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,040
is the way to go on that and the more

1133
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,880
you can automate from security you know

1134
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,240
the better because at the end of the day

1135
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,119
the

1136
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,359
attacks are evolving and

1137
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,920
they're using automation to attack so

1138
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,079
you should also use automation to defend

1139
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,040
um

1140
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,560
this one's more aimed towards obviously

1141
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,079
smaller organizations like maybe even

1142
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,320
like smbs but there's a lot of existing

1143
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
controls out there

1144
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,359
that are just being underutilized so a

1145
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,400
lot of a lot of tools that you have have

1146
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
multi-factor authentication available

1147
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,800
um you know their password managers are

1148
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,760
proven

1149
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,480
to

1150
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,440
reduce

1151
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
um any kind of attacks related to

1152
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,960
passwords because at the end of the day

1153
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
you can actually have secure passwords

1154
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,280
in a way that people will

1155
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,119
be able to use them versus them using

1156
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,000
the one password for all every single

1157
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,079
login right so

1158
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,599
because when that happens as you all

1159
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,760
know maybe

1160
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,160
you know bank of america is hard to

1161
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,000
break into but maybe

1162
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,640
myfunsite.com

1163
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,160
isn't so hard to break into and if

1164
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,240
you're using the same login password for

1165
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,200
bank of america and myfunsite.com like

1166
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,400
hey that's just

1167
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
username and id password just let me

1168
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,359
just try out on all the banks and see

1169
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,280
what works um

1170
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
so yeah i mean just just really just

1171
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
just leaning into existing stuff it

1172
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,000
doesn't cost anything extra um both on a

1173
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,119
personal level and again if you're a

1174
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,800
smaller organization like this this is

1175
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,720
the way to go and then you can look at

1176
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,200
hey what are my gaps after that what do

1177
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,960
i actually need to spend money on

1178
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
um this is actually so i had built this

1179
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,640
slide

1180
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,960
uh a while ago but this seems to be the

1181
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,040
theme of the conference in terms of uh

1182
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,520
talked to a lot of people that are the

1183
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,960
have mirrored the same thing is just

1184
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,720
stop just just stop it with the

1185
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,119
perimeter like we're we're past that you

1186
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,800
know again that's not how we this that's

1187
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,040
not how it works anymore you can't

1188
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,920
say

1189
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
we're gonna keep attackers out 100 of

1190
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,680
the time and we're going to keep data

1191
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,520
from you know egressing our organization

1192
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,560
100 percent

1193
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,400
it's just impossible so instead of

1194
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,720
thinking about just out versus in we

1195
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,160
need to think about and this you know

1196
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,240
buzzword-wise goes into zero trust but

1197
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,160
we need to think about um

1198
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,680
how do we actually protect our assets in

1199
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,440
a way that assuming that attackers are

1200
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,800
getting on our devices assuming

1201
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,319
attackers are getting in our networks

1202
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,480
how do we protect our assets um one of

1203
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,160
those assets is data one of those assets

1204
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,000
is your devices how do you actually

1205
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,079
secure on an individual as individual as

1206
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,560
possible as granular as possible

1207
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,640
way of you know securing that so that

1208
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
way

1209
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,599
remote work if you start with that

1210
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,200
everything else becomes not so bad right

1211
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,160
so

1212
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,319
if you solve that problem then remote

1213
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,400
work all of a sudden is not a big deal

1214
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,319
right they can they can travel anywhere

1215
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,920
with their with their devices because

1216
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,599
you solve the the asset protection

1217
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,680
problem if you don't then it's like how

1218
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,839
do we make sure that people are

1219
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,280
going through the vpn how do we make

1220
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,480
sure we have enough bandwidth on our

1221
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,160
vpns and throughputs that we're not

1222
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,680
slowing everyone down so that they turn

1223
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,000
the vpn off and then oh hey look now

1224
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,880
they're connected to sketchy wi-fi um

1225
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,640
so again like if there's anything you

1226
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,760
remember

1227
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,440
if there's anything you you tweet out

1228
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,920
there uh this one

1229
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,280
um

1230
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,839
yeah so

1231
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,240
it's it's really the difference between

1232
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,520
the at the bottom the highlighter point

1233
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,040
instead of hoping

1234
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,319
and wishing on a prayer that people are

1235
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,760
going to do the right thing

1236
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,480
um just plan for them to do the wrong

1237
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,880
thing and then how do we build a secure

1238
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,119
posture assuming that the wrong thing is

1239
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,040
going to occur because if we're hoping

1240
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,119
for the best um

1241
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,160
that's not a good security strategy

1242
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
so last slide here

1243
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,599
and just next steps right so what are

1244
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,000
some some easy easy to do

1245
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,400
next steps if you wanted to implement um

1246
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,480
kind of the evolution of cyber security

1247
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,240
uh number one to just stop stop buying

1248
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
the buzzwords right so

1249
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,319
they at the end of the day i said like i

1250
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,640
said there's a lot of existing um

1251
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
capabilities that you already have in

1252
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
your organization that just need to be

1253
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,680
leveraged you know correctly um or used

1254
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,800
period like straight up used um

1255
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,560
and again really just focusing on the

1256
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,640
on the productivity aspect will flush

1257
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,760
out a lot of error a lot of issues with

1258
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,160
the human error

1259
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,200
so again also with the education

1260
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,280
instead of only doing fishing education

1261
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,200
you know let's focus on teaching users

1262
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,319
about

1263
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,240
about those other things out there about

1264
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,079
password managers give some references

1265
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,720
maybe buy a corporate one for everybody

1266
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,599
you know using mfa why mfa is important

1267
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,040
making sure people are turning it on

1268
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,480
their personal devices

1269
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,440
um

1270
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,960
and the more you know education we have

1271
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
surrounded by you know about kind of

1272
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,920
daily um and personal security the more

1273
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,839
that's gonna be reflected as they're at

1274
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,160
work um with the organization um and the

1275
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,599
last bullet point is what i'll leave you

1276
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,599
with here is just solve the real issues

1277
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,400
at hand which is just a lack of time and

1278
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,319
a lack of interest from the user base

1279
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,119
i've never spoken to any security

1280
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,040
professional who says oh i have too many

1281
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,880
too many employees that work in our

1282
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,400
security staff i don't know what to do

1283
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,800
with them all or i have we have so much

1284
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,640
time yeah i've never talked to a sister

1285
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,839
who's like i got just

1286
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,960
all i got is people and time and money

1287
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,200
um and he's like oh yeah right

1288
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,960
where do you work

1289
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,000
um let me jump on that team but um yeah

1290
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,680
i mean there's a there's constant lack

1291
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,520
of time both on your end user's

1292
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,119
standpoint you know they're they're just

1293
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,319
trying to get their job done and the

1294
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,160
constant lack of time from a securities

1295
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,000
professional standpoint in terms of you

1296
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,680
there's never enough you can do and

1297
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,960
there's definitely never enough you can

1298
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,440
do if if you're focused on just chasing

1299
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,880
your users and telling them to try to do

1300
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,400
the right thing

1301
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,800
and then again that last one just

1302
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,640
assume people aren't interested assume

1303
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,079
people are going to do the wrong thing

1304
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,000
how do we protect our assets if they're

1305
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
going to do the wrong thing

1306
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,240
and with that really appreciate you

1307
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,839
picking me over spinach artichoke dip um

1308
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,480
hopefully you don't regret it and yeah

1309
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,079
if you have any questions find me on

1310
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,040
linkedin

1311
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,000
twitter i'm happy to answer them also uh

1312
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,440
i think we have some time i can answer

1313
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,359
some questions five minutes

1314
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,520
otherwise if you see me afterwards come

1315
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,200
up to talk to me i'd love to talk but

1316
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,119
yeah any questions

1317
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,119
yes

1318
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,440
is

1319
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,640
um

1320
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,960
yeah

1321
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,119
yeah definitely so the question is uh

1322
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,319
acknowledging the fact that most

1323
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,880
organizations do uh acknowledge human

1324
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,440
error as an issue and currently are

1325
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,839
pushing out uh education for that but

1326
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,359
the issue being not a lot of

1327
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,440
accountability based off of that

1328
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,960
what do i feel about

1329
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,720
implementing accountability into that

1330
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,640
training as a part of performance review

1331
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,560
for example um so yeah great great

1332
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,480
question and great point i actually do

1333
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,000
think that

1334
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,440
it does go back into what i said in

1335
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,480
terms of the big fundamental issue is uh

1336
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,800
security decisions versus job doing

1337
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,720
whatever for your job so if you make

1338
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,560
security decisions part of their job

1339
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,920
then yeah that actually does solve part

1340
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
of the part of the issue and again the

1341
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,359
more we

1342
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,560
spend time

1343
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,400
um putting some sort of value on

1344
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
security beyond just like you should do

1345
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,480
the thing i think it will help so yeah i

1346
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,400
mean i i would say

1347
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,480
i would 100 agree with adding if if

1348
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,079
data security or any kind of security is

1349
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,079
important to your organization adding a

1350
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,520
level of that into someone's job

1351
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,599
performance review um and then after

1352
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,839
that it just really would just take how

1353
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:50,800
do we

1354
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,480
properly um

1355
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,079
capture those metrics how do we you know

1356
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,000
how do we be able to build that provably

1357
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
into that person's performance in a way

1358
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,839
that we can say hey you know you aren't

1359
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,960
doing the right thing you are doing the

1360
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,119
right thing yadda yadda but overall i'd

1361
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,280
say i think that's a great idea

1362
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,240
uh yes

1363
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,359
i'm sorry about what might be a

1364
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,319
significant cost center i've heard that

1365
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,480
charles darwin and charles dickens only

1366
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,240
work four hours a day

1367
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
and they changed the world how many

1368
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,200
people

1369
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,640
are making more mistakes just because

1370
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,240
yeah i mean

1371
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,160
that oh so the the question is how many

1372
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,359
people are making too much mistakes

1373
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,760
because they're tired and like i myself

1374
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,040
have

1375
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,000
almost clicked on a sketchy phishing

1376
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,680
email i was just and honestly the reason

1377
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,359
why i didn't fully click it was i got

1378
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,040
distracted um but

1379
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,160
but i was i was tired right i was tired

1380
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,480
it was like i forget what what the email

1381
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,240
actually was but it was it was something

1382
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,160
that's similar to like something i was

1383
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
dealing with and again i was tired and i

1384
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,559
was like oh let me just like because i

1385
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,680
pretty much was reading much emails

1386
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,520
queuing up a bunch of links um so i

1387
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,200
almost clicked it and then um actually

1388
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,559
i'm pretty sure my co-founder called me

1389
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,280
and i got distracted but um

1390
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,839
or maybe i was just watching a youtube

1391
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,839
video but uh we'll leave that up to your

1392
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,760
imaginations on what i actually got

1393
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,920
distracted by but yeah i mean i i almost

1394
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,559
clicked it right so it's like i i know

1395
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,920
the right thing the right thing to do

1396
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,800
but the more tired you are the more

1397
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,559
you know the the less

1398
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,240
vigilant you are right and again it goes

1399
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,440
in the driving like you wouldn't want

1400
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,000
someone on the road who hasn't slept you

1401
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,319
know you know for 24 hours let's say so

1402
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,920
why would you want them to

1403
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,839
make security decisions yes

1404
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,480
what they think is a phishing email

1405
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,160
they're like so then they go on their

1406
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,040
side and they're like guys

1407
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,800
i have not i mean i i actually really

1408
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,440
agree with that so the question being um

1409
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,280
instead of just waiting for people to

1410
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,720
make a mistake let's normalize um

1411
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,880
kind of a community looking together so

1412
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,960
i've seen versions of that but so that's

1413
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,400
a way better version than what i've seen

1414
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,640
and what i've seen is um it's and

1415
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,480
security staff saying hey you should

1416
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,160
email me when it's a sketchy email and

1417
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,400
i'll look through it um the issue there

1418
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,680
is again going back to the security

1419
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,960
staff time people don't have ain't

1420
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,880
nobody got time for that

1421
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,119
and they get a lot of emails that like

1422
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,119
aren't phishing emails which from again

1423
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,960
going back to human error if you have a

1424
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,640
human looking at a bunch of emails

1425
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,040
eventually they're gonna slip up um and

1426
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,480
again it just becomes just a uh

1427
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,640
just a way to you know just it's not

1428
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,319
effective so i agree with the uh

1429
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,960
community approach um that's time for me

1430
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,079
but again if you have any other

1431
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,000
questions find me thanks

1432
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,630
[Applause]

1433
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,000
you
