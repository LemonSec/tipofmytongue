1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,880
i'm guessing you guys can hear me

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,680
yeah

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,880
okay

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
people still uh coming in a little bit

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,760
that's okay

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,359
thank you everyone for showing up right

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,359
after lunch i know you guys are probably

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,760
nursing your food comas uh there's gonna

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,640
be a little bit of audience

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
participation in this i hope i can get

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
you guys to to scream a little bit or

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,399
maybe raise your hands

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,800
uh but we're here and we're going to be

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
talking about threat intelligence as it

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
and whether it's actionable in in the

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,719
year 2022

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,239
that of course implies that it wasn't

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,079
actionable before 2022 that's not what

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,320
i'm trying to imply but but as as we go

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
through the presentation

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,559
um i'm going to show everyone how it

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,879
evolved from what it was and what people

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,640
considered threat intelligence circa

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
2012 let's say to what it's considered

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,760
today

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
right and and that's kind of the premise

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,239
of the talk now full disclosure there's

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,840
some academic boring stuff at the

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,760
beginning so apologies for that but

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
there are some concepts that we just

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,320
have to go through a little equation

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
nothing nothing too crazy but first the

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
obligatory who am i slide hi my name is

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
peter i've been in this industry for 16

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
years uh on a w-2 in the 90s i was

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,600
getting in trouble on the internet with

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
knocks on a door and this type of stuff

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,960
but i've worked everything from the

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,200
hedge fund space building high frequency

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
trading systems that are secure i've

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
been doing pen testing i've been doing

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
red teaming also application security

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
etc etc

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
and now i run the engineering team at

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,880
flashpoint which is a threat

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
intelligence vendor so that's also a

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,439
disclosure that i work for a threat

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
intelligence vendor right i think that's

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
very important to uh to tell everybody

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
because there's an inherent bias with

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
threat intelligence in general and

52
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
coming from a vendor perspective is very

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,079
different than threat intelligence at a

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,759
small company when you're trying to

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,560
protect your video game your bank

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
whatever so i think that's also

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
important another thing i'd like to

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
mention is like this this talk was

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
really inspired by mark arnold's talk

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,720
from this very conference in 2018 on

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,640
hacking intelligence also a great

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,319
intelligence chat if you haven't uh

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,920
checked it out mark thank you and i know

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
you're sitting right there

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
thanks very much and also i'd like to

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
say that i'm coming from a very

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
privileged stance in an organization

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,560
that has great makers organizations our

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,239
intelligence teams our product teams are

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,800
fantastic and i have to give a shout out

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,519
to my engineering team over 76 brilliant

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
engineers trying to solve some really

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,120
really hard problems when it comes to

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,280
threat intelligence the scale that we're

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
dealing at is petabytes of data

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
terabytes of data a second it's so hard

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
to do and how do you funnel that stuff

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
up into something that's usually usable

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
actionable by your business

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
so like i said we're going to get a

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
little academic in the beginning so

82
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
apologies so here's the obligatory

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
definition of threat intelligence that

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,360
this is one of the few slides i'm going

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
to read directly off of again apologies

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,239
but i'm just going to the the gartner

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,760
definition um and um and if you guys are

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,879
want to play a game there's some

89
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,400
hexadecimal on the bottom figure that

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
out

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,280
but threat intelligence is an

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
evidence-based knowledge and

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,519
evidence-based knowledge including

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,200
context mechanisms indicators

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
implications and active action oriented

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,319
action being a key word there advice how

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
about how an existing an emerging member

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
or hazard to your assets sorry as i

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
slurred there a little bit this

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
intelligence can be used to inform

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
decisions regarding the subject's

102
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,400
response to a menace and or hazard right

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,720
this is how gartner defines it today uh

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,159
gartner just released a paper about how

105
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,920
to action threat intelligence i suggest

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,480
you read that it's pretty good um

107
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,040
one of the things that uh that that we

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,319
think about when we think about threat

109
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,760
intelligence against full disclosure

110
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
this is like the one vendor thing i

111
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,239
promise i'm not trying to sell you

112
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,080
anything but i think it's uh really

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
important that you guys know that

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
intelligence not just threat

115
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,959
intelligence intelligence and we're

116
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,480
going to talk about ontology of what

117
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,519
that means later intelligence allows you

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,760
to take rapid informed actions to

119
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
mitigate risk

120
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
or remediate risk or compensate risk

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
this is really important

122
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
intelligence is everywhere you need it

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,440
to be around the clock whenever you need

124
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
it to be and it's coming from sources

125
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,479
all over the the public internet also

126
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,320
the deep and dark web if you want to get

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
into the technical definitions of that

128
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
what that means we can but this stuff

129
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
comes from everywhere and not one

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
company well maybe google can but now

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
one company in a reasonable sense can

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,880
collect the entire internet

133
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,680
and really do the and really surface

134
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
these things in a quick

135
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
and informed way so that's what we we

136
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,520
try to do as threat intelligence

137
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,120
practitioners not just flashpoint

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,639
everybody we have to get this

139
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,320
intelligence to the people that need it

140
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,280
in order to mitigate take action etc

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
so obligatory concept number one the

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
diagram has anyone seen this

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
intelligence cycle diagram before show

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,759
of hands

145
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,360
really okay all right so go on wikipedia

146
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,160
um

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
the intelligence cycle um is what is

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,840
used by most intelligence agencies on

149
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
the planet

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
that includes our friends in the federal

151
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,039
government it's the cia the fbi but that

152
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
also includes the chinese intelligence

153
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,039
it also includes the fsb so on and so

154
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,639
forth this

155
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
concept of threatened of intelligence in

156
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,479
general is is a cycle it's wheel it's a

157
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,320
wheel and it's informative most

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
intelligence organizations

159
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,280
um write up uh finished intelligence

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,400
reports to inform policy decisions

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
that's what happens right but what i

162
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
think what i want everyone here to take

163
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
away from is that in this in this

164
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
process you have to plan and direct your

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
intelligence organization

166
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,919
for example somebody who issues sim

167
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,280
cards has a different threat

168
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
intelligence profile than somebody who

169
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
releases a video game those threat

170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
intelligence programs are not the same

171
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
and we have to accommodate for that also

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
collection is super important and i want

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
to distinguish this collection is

174
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
probably one of the most important

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,080
pieces of of intelligence but collecting

176
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
data is not intelligence

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
data turns into intelligence after

178
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
processing an analysis

179
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,759
so after processing an analysis we then

180
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,520
get something

181
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,199
produced to you that is then

182
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
disseminated to your organizations to

183
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
the key stakeholders that can inform

184
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,000
policy decisions or inform a firewall

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
policy it can be soft decisions human

186
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,160
decisions it could also be technical

187
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,039
decisions so that is the obligatory

188
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,639
concept number one when we talk about

189
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,000
threat intelligence it's coming from

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
this world it's coming from

191
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,319
a

192
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,199
world based in human intelligence if

193
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
anyone knows how a cia case officer

194
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
works you just get out of training out

195
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
of the cia you're now a spy you get

196
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
probably sent to some agency

197
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,280
overseas you're you're you're

198
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,160
stationed at an office and you go out

199
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,440
and you meet one of your contacts who

200
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
works at a factory and you say i'll give

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
you 500

202
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,639
and you tell me what the output of your

203
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
factory is going to be for the next

204
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,479
couple of weeks right that's humans

205
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,599
human intelligence right it's that uh i

206
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,680
see you feds shifting in your sheets i i

207
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
see you

208
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,319
right

209
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,720
that that's human intelligence uh and

210
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
and that stuff is super important but

211
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,720
that takes on a different context in the

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
digital world and i'm going to talk

213
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,199
about that

214
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,120
obligatory concept number two one

215
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
equation and and we're done i promise

216
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
uh so in this one equation if you ever

217
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
read an infosec textbook infosec is what

218
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
we used to call it in the 90s before it

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
was cyber security

220
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
you're going to find this equation of

221
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,560
how to identify risk i i know that there

222
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,840
are two equations on the screen let's go

223
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
with the bottom one

224
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,879
it's basically threat times

225
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,560
vulnerability equals risk you add in

226
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,199
your impact impact is a measured source

227
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,759
of how a potential breach to your asset

228
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,800
can impact your entire organization

229
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
and

230
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
and you also have to like add in the

231
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
likelihood and likelihood the likelihood

232
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,840
is calculated in many different ways but

233
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
you have to factor in the technical

234
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,599
controls that you have in place for for

235
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,759
something that's on your network so for

236
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
example if you have your crown jewels on

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
an air-gapped computer that never

238
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,280
touches the internet on your network a i

239
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
don't know how you did that but great

240
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
but but b that's probably not going to

241
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,080
be

242
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,199
uh subjected to a ddos attack right so

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,400
these are the basic steps in identifying

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,479
risk in an organization and threat

245
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,159
intelligence as i said before helps

246
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,440
mitigate compensate or remediate risk

247
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,479
so

248
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,000
let's play a game

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
we're going to design an infosec program

250
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958
uh is justin here justin varner

251
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,760
no

252
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,560
okay um but uh we're gonna define an

253
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
infosec program um

254
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
and at the very high level what we're

255
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
seeing what we're seeing on the slide is

256
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
the basics of an infosec program at a

257
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
small and medium business right

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
hypothetically let's just say our

259
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,240
business is around 200 people

260
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
and we invest in firewalls the best ones

261
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
utms you got your ids ips built right in

262
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
wildfire sandbox whatever right like you

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
have your best firewalls then you have

264
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
your endpoint and avs or your semantics

265
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,959
mcafee sentinel one whatever and your

266
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
vulnerability scanner there's mo there's

267
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,880
a lot of breach laws out there that

268
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
require vulnerability scanners so now

269
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,920
you have your vulnerability scanners

270
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
would you guys say this is like the

271
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,600
start of a good infosec program

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,160
bruce schneider infosec is a process not

273
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,640
a not a product right right let's say we

274
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
have the processes in place it's it's a

275
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
it's a good it's a good start right it's

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
very basic but it's a good start but

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,839
let's say we have budget our 200 person

278
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,920
company has a budget and we can add in a

279
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
little bit more things onto there asset

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,839
management from tanium who sponsored

281
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,839
something here uh

282
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
endpoint edr dlp your mail gateways your

283
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
application security firewall that

284
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
that's really good for mitigating

285
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,519
threats uh to your web application but

286
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,160
secure coding i think is probably better

287
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
so you're also paying up for the premium

288
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,399
versions of your repository so you can

289
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,640
do static analysis dynamic analysis make

290
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
sure your licenses are in compliance

291
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,839
with what your policies are so on and so

292
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,839
forth now our infosec program looks a

293
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
little bit better right

294
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,279
a little bit better right we have a

295
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,720
little bit more tools we have a little

296
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
bit more coverage more visibility on the

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
inside of our network

298
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
we have a little bit more budget so why

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
don't we throw in a sim you guys anyone

300
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,839
here ever configure a sim

301
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
how's how's that been like the six

302
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,279
months of your life right like that's

303
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,000
that's that's tough stuff uh right so

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,120
and then we're gonna get some threat

305
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
intelligence feeds circa 2012. you guys

306
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
remember here's my number call me maybe

307
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,360
that was the summer jam back then right

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,160
that

309
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,519
our threat intelligence fees are from

310
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
2012 and that's important because when

311
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,720
we were thinking about threat

312
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
intelligence back then it was ip

313
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
addresses domains

314
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,560
yara rules that's what we were thinking

315
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
about and so that's what we got and also

316
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
personnel so including yourself

317
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,079
in this 200 person company you got one

318
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,560
plus one staff member right so now this

319
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,399
is our infosec program you have all

320
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
these tools you have some process plus

321
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
one staff member oh by the way you guys

322
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,920
are also doing i.t changing printers and

323
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,399
all this other stuff sound familiar

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,519
anybody

325
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,920
right i'm the infosec guy i'm also the

326
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,720
printer changer guy yeah it it happens

327
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,600
um

328
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,320
so

329
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,000
we're in good shape but there are some

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,480
things we still can't buy right uh for

331
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
example we can't buy any sidecar

332
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
products for our kubernetes clusters our

333
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
microservices all this other stuff we

334
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
don't have the professional service

335
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,959
hours to configure our sims so we'll

336
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,040
figure that out later on or any of the

337
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
other cool new toys that everyone's

338
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,920
selling us nowadays but looking at this

339
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,200
infoset program for smb small medium

340
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
business looks okay right if your

341
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,519
processes are okay you can probably pass

342
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,120
a sock to audit

343
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,959
maybe even a fedramp audit depending on

344
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,160
what you're doing

345
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
but before we get there let's let's talk

346
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
about what our business is all right so

347
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,720
now we've designed this infosec program

348
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,040
for our for our business and let's do

349
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
something simple that probably has a low

350
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,040
threat profile

351
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,639
let's just show credit cards

352
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,880
that's what we do we're issuing credit

353
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,360
cards in our 200 person company

354
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,639
um

355
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,920
and uh

356
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
and yeah that if somebody needs a credit

357
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,519
card if apple's coming out with a new

358
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,800
credit card they come to us and they're

359
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
like we need a new credit card we're

360
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
like we got you we'll do the new apple

361
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,079
credit card let's do it so on and so

362
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,839
forth okay and this is where the

363
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,399
audience participation part comes in so

364
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
i'm going to i'm going to say what you

365
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
guys are going to see on screen

366
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
is what we would consider threat

367
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,480
intelligence and i'm going to

368
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
ask you guys to say i or nay about

369
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
whether this piece of threat

370
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
intelligence is actionable within the

371
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
constructs of our company that we just

372
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,120
defined

373
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,079
so

374
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,240
really quickly let's start with an easy

375
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
one

376
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,480
who knows what's on screen

377
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,480
it's a yara rule right it goes into your

378
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
uh utm i know we're all tired i know we

379
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
just state so the irs or nays um just so

380
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
you know there's no like right or wrong

381
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
answer i think it's more of like an

382
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
audience thing if you guys hear more

383
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,079
people say eye for something or some

384
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,200
people say nate that tells you about

385
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
their own environments rather than our

386
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,279
environment but based on what we talked

387
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,160
about

388
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,240
in setting up our infosec program is

389
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
this actionable eyes

390
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
eyes come on no one

391
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
one person is this actionable no okay uh

392
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,200
nays

393
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,120
no i got a little got a little hums over

394
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
there so some days all right fine uh

395
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
we're all eating it's it's a yara rule

396
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,079
this can be this can be consumed by our

397
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,880
ids and ips right it's for conte

398
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
ransomware con for conti ransomware it's

399
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,959
based behavioral you can put this into

400
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,639
your devices and it can stop this stuff

401
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
on your network it's it's it's fairly

402
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,639
actionable how about this one next one

403
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,199
is is this actionable

404
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,079
yes

405
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,920

406
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
okay

407
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,440

what's up there

411
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
it's stuxnet

412
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
we deliver credit cards how many

413
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
programmable logic controllers do you

414
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
think exist in our office anyone have a

415
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
siemens

416
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
plc in their office it's actionable

417
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
absolutely is it relevant to us

418
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,000
i don't know depends where your office

419
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
is how about this

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
anyone know what paceman is

421
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,079
somebody posting something on paceman

422
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,920
they just post hi

423
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
is this actionable

424
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
this one's easy

425
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
nays right right like it's it's not

426
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,839
really actionable there's really zero

427
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
context here there's not much we can do

428
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
with with this piece of information all

429
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
right how about this one

430
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
we get an email

431
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
from csa

432
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,600
your oracle java 7 security manager

433
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
bypass vulnerability

434
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,560
is this actionable

435
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,880
aye thank you yes this is absolutely

436
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
actionable but unlike

437
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
the yara rules uh that we had before

438
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
which were automatically consumed by our

439
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,600
devices this is an email that comes into

440
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
our probably security inbox and we've

441
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
got to make sure that us or our staff

442
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
sees this email and then takes uh action

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120
appropriately throughout the

444
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
organization and since we run both it

445
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
and infosec and there's no concept of

446
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
sres or devops or something like that in

447
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
our business we're it's on it's on the

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
hook here to make sure that our java

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,279
libraries are up to date and not uh

450
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,560
vulnerable to to these uh uh to this uh

451
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,320
uh vulnerability not vulnerable to

452
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,079
vulnerability all right anyway

453
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,040
but how about this next one relatively

454
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,320
easy is the is this actionable

455
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,880
we can probably identify that it's an ip

456
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,959
address right

457
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,720
it's uh does anyone know that subnet

458
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,560
some people do

459
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,639
how about now

460
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,160
this is one of the net blocks used by

461
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,480
apt and then that very famous mandiant

462
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,079
report apt-1 is this actionable now

463
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,000
it's getting closer

464
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,079
right we can absolutely put this in our

465
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,440
firewall

466
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,320
right this was published in october 25th

467
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,279
2004. in our in our company where we're

468
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,120
issuing credit cards

469
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,399
right is this actionable do we have

470
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,000
business in china

471
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
do we need to have access to china so so

472
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
on and so forth it gets a little harder

473
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,399
right like this can very easily be

474
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
blocked in a firewall it can very easily

475
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,560
be actionable but do we want to action

476
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,000
it some decision making has to take

477
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,680
place here how about this one

478
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
what are we looking at here

479
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
dns

480
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,959
right have you guys ever subscribed to a

481
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,800
feed that you automatically feed into a

482
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
firewall and that feed gets popped and

483
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,639
now you're blocking all dns queries out

484
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,639
of your organization has that ever

485
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,600
happened

486
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
it could happen your threat intelligence

487
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
vendors can get popped right like yes

488
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
it's absolutely actionable and you might

489
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
not even see it get into your systems

490
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
but it can definitely uh ruin your day

491
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,279
it can definitely ruin your day

492
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,720
right and

493
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
this is part of the problem of threat

494
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,399
intelligence at least as it was in circa

495
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,039
2012 all right let's fast forward all

496
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,000
right we're in 2022 we're at rva sec the

497
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,640
world has changed right we got some

498
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
threat intelligence vendors there's

499
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
there's a lot of them out there topping

500
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,280
the charts right now is kate bush does

501
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
anyone know why

502
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
yes yeah stranger things good stuff

503
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
katie bush is on top again good job

504
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,599
right we finally got our sim configured

505
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,000
it's working now it's awesome it's been

506
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,760
it's been 10 years we finally got it

507
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,480
done we got some piv protocol chips that

508
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
we're using mfa on our laptop so we uh

509
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
mfa everywhere and we have local low

510
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
code automation we can automate things

511
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,120
that come that come in

512
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
and and it's like a soar right and now

513
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
since our business was so good and

514
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
selling credit cards we thought hey

515
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
let's sell sim cards they're both cards

516
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
right how hard could it be right so now

517
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
we're a business selling credit cards

518
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
and sim cards but the threat

519
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,559
intelligence landscape has changed a

520
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,720
little bit right like in 2012 we're

521
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
talking about feeds we're talking about

522
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,880
emails right like one of the one of the

523
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
questions i get asked a lot it's like oh

524
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,799
flashpoint you guys are a threat

525
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,240
intelligence feed

526
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,799
yeah sure we have that uh like every

527
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
that's par for the course everyone has

528
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
the the yara rules coming in everyone

529
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
has the domains coming in everyone has

530
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
ip addresses coming in but i want to

531
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
show you guys what it looks like a

532
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,840
little bit differently we're going to

533
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
start with an easy one again

534
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,919
it's another yara rule

535
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
right the same as last time 2012 to 2022

536
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
we need this stuff it gets into our

537
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,960
systems

538
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
what's interesting and there's a whole

539
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
other talk here is like the statistics

540
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
of all the yara rules that you put into

541
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
your firewalls how many of them actually

542
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
stop the breach on your system there's a

543
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,039
whole talk there but this is actionable

544
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,200
this can go straight into your device it

545
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,559
can definitely do the thing that it

546
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,000
needs to do

547
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
and i'm not sure if you guys can re can

548
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,919
you read it what kind of malware it is

549
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,440
trickbot are you guys familiar with

550
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,640
trickbot

551
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,600
it's a big one these days right so how

552
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,799
about this

553
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,960
what if i told you

554
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
i know a lot about trickbot

555
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
is this actionable

556
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
here's an information page i can tell

557
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,000
you

558
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,799
a little a little blurb about trickbot

559
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
how many iocs i have for trickbots when

560
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,080
it was first seen when it was last seen

561
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
i can tell you the attack tags and very

562
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,919
granular detail that you can put into

563
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,240
your misp instance or any other type of

564
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
tip and uh and and filter it down and i

565
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
can also tell you that uh among

566
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,320
communities on on on the on the internet

567
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,080
it's being discussed pretty actively

568
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,918
these days is that actionable

569
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,360
maybe

570
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,679
in our 200 person company

571
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
right like we have us and one other it

572
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
person this might be if that person has

573
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
a high turnover and it's a new security

574
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
analyst and they look at this it's like

575
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
it's good to know

576
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,360
but what if this what if this report has

577
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
the iocs attached to it and it's a

578
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
consumable via api

579
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,760
now it's now it's really actionable now

580
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,039
you're not not you're not only getting

581
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,720
one yara rule you're getting a whole

582
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
bunch you're getting a whole bunch of

583
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,039
events with a lot of context i'm telling

584
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,720
you about trick bots that hit health

585
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,240
care places i'm telling you about trick

586
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,880
bots that hit of financial services

587
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
places i'm also telling you about

588
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,559
checkpoints that hit aerospace places

589
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,440
and

590
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,039
these types of behaviors are very

591
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,320
different even though it's the same

592
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,240
piece of malware the context here

593
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
matters it's not just an ip address

594
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,120
anymore the yara rules are are a great

595
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
start but it's only after you're looking

596
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
at them in the aggregate that you can

597
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
start to make informed decisions about

598
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
how you really want to consume this type

599
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
of type of stuff what if you need more

600
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
context right in this example where two

601
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,159
hundred page we're 200 person org with

602
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,720
two it people a security person

603
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,320
we may not have

604
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,039
the budget or the team to consume more

605
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,200
context but we can give it to you

606
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
what if you have a reverse engineering

607
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,679
team

608
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
right you can look at the pe headers we

609
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,600
can give you context

610
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,520
that's freely available on the internet

611
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,440
osens regular stuff we all know about

612
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,840
this and we can add that to the report

613
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
and you can consume that via via an api

614
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,000
it's not just the feed anymore the

615
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,520
context matters

616
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,880
right and um and we're moving on uh now

617
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,280
how about

618
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,720
non-non-yara rule examples right it gets

619
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
a little boring with the r rules the

620
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
same thing everything how about this

621
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,159
what's what's going on here

622
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,880
we're issuing credit cards here right

623
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,520
like so that that's good i can show you

624
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,000
the amount of card not present fraud

625
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
versus card present fraud any msas in

626
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,360
the room

627
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
pci msas no

628
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
okay those are the guys that audit you

629
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
for pci compliance but

630
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,840
anyway card present versus card not

631
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,320
president fraud card not present fraud

632
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,240
in general in the industry is the higher

633
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
one that means people aren't physically

634
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
spoofing cards as much anymore they're

635
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
using them in online transactions right

636
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,080
and these vendors are getting breached

637
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,559
and these card numbers are being sold

638
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,039
all over the web for very cheap and i

639
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,159
can tell you

640
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,039
that

641
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,600
our cards in the last seven days account

642
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,559
for over 222 000 in potential fraud loss

643
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,919
if our card's minimum value is a 500 500

644
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,200
line of credit

645
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
so for this example for this

646
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,799
presentation i pulled a subset of the

647
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,080
bigger number this number is in the

648
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
billions when you talk about the major

649
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
card providers out there

650
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,320
right

651
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,200
this uh and we can and you can customize

652
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
what kind of bins you want to track in

653
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,080
your system what kind of bins you don't

654
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,679
want to track in your system apple may

655
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,200
come to you and say

656
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
i need a bunch of new credit cards all

657
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,559
right here are your bin numbers let's

658
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,240
track apple's bin numbers

659
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,679
across the web are they getting breached

660
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,360
more than other bin numbers so on and so

661
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,559
forth the context here matters but this

662
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
is not consumable but any of the devices

663
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,280
that are in our system what just

664
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,039
happened

665
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,640
how is this different than a yara rule

666
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,799
is it intelligence

667
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,080
right if you're coming from a world

668
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,880
where intelligence is an ip address

669
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
this might not be useful to you

670
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,960
but our 200 person company is not the

671
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,080
same as

672
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
major credit card provider

673
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,919
out out there what we're looking at here

674
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
and the difference here is we're looking

675
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
outside the perimeter

676
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
for a potential impact

677
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,120
that rit team cannot control

678
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,600
but if you have a fraud team

679
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
if you have a fraud team now this this

680
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,919
becomes actionable if you can invest in

681
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,080
a fraud team and and you can say wait

682
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,520
wait wait how much of my cards are

683
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,559
breached

684
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,760
where are they breached where are they

685
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
being sold well i can tell you that i

686
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
can tell you exactly how much of your uh

687
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
uh how much of your cards are added per

688
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,520
breach on the top there one breach had

689
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,880
267 cards in it

690
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,640
the average price of all your cards

691
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,159
across all the marketplaces where

692
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,520
they're being sold

693
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,559
is 9.97

694
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,440
right

695
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,039
like and

696
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,720
and the total cards added across the

697
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,080
breaches in the last seven days is over

698
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,679
5188 cards only across

699
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,520
13 bin numbers

700
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,080
right so if you have a fraud team this

701
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,679
is very actionable but what do you need

702
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,200
what do you need in order to take action

703
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
on this on at a frost team

704
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
you might need the full card numbers

705
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,480
right

706
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,320
you might need a full card numbers and

707
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,760
that that's something that modern threat

708
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
intelligence vendors have as well

709
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,120
we can get that card cancelled before a

710
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,360
threat actor can sell it to some to a

711
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,799
willing buyer

712
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,480
that's threat intelligence it's not an

713
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,799
ip address everyone has ip address

714
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
that's threat intelligence your card

715
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,840
you're as a consumer you're safe because

716
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
these fraud departments that's what they

717
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,679
do 24 7.

718
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,840
that's not a hyperbole they're they're

719
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,440
365 24 7. it's like a sock it's like a

720
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,200
knock that's always staffed this stuff

721
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,679
is happening all the time what about

722
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,159
card present fraud moving on card

723
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,240
present fraud is when people are making

724
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,320
fake copies of your credit cards and

725
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
they're then then they're going places

726
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,679
and then they're using those credit

727
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,279
cards now

728
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,679
uh that's a little bit harder to stop

729
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,279
but i have all this breach data about

730
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,760
your cards what if i can tell you

731
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,840
i can localize

732
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
where these cards are being breached

733
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,919
where these skimmers are where is the

734
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,520
highest volume of skimmers for your

735
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
particular cards

736
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,799
i can tell you that

737
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,400
i can tell you the exact zip codes where

738
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,279
your cards got breached or where right

739
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,080
so

740
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,360
now you can work with your liaisons in

741
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,799
law enforcement to get these skimmers

742
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,480
out offline and everyone know what i'm

743
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,520
talking about when i'm talking about a

744
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,440
credit card skimmer like you pull it off

745
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,919
your normal you put it into an atm but

746
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,919
there's a place on it to read your card

747
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,279
like we have a lot of information uh uh

748
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,679
in in this space around where this stuff

749
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,760
is localized that's intelligence it's

750
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,600
not just an ip address it's not just a

751
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,240
feed it's it's far more than that all

752
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,320
right getting back to more traditional

753
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
stuff

754
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,200
this is what's called a finished

755
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
intelligence report

756
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
in in the physical world in the law

757
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,640
enforcement world this would be on a

758
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,919
piece of paper

759
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,919
and it would go to somebody who's an

760
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,320
informed policy or decision maker

761
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,080
right in our world in the digital world

762
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,640
it might go to a cso a director or or

763
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,200
something like that based on this report

764
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,039
just in it of itself just on the title

765
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,520
and the stock photo picture

766
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,120
uh is this is this actionable

767
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
like

768
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,200
it's a it's a it's a report right a

769
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
physical report it can be actionable

770
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,760
it's it's a trick question you how could

771
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,440
you possibly answer the question without

772
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,360
knowing what's in the report right

773
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,640
so the the report does have more data in

774
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,960
it right and the report tells you these

775
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,559
are the trendings uh these are the

776
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,480
trending vulnerabilities that are

777
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,600
happening as of may 2022 and deep in

778
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,120
dark web communities where people are

779
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,440
trying to find exploits and some of them

780
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,400
have confirmed remote code execution

781
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,360
uh

782
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
problems with them and over here we have

783
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
the number of mentions whether it has

784
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,559
remote code the actual name of the cve

785
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,159
so on and so forth now this is a little

786
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,159
bit more actionable right we all have a

787
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,080
vulnerability scanner we can check if

788
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,000
we're exposure well you know what i find

789
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
interesting about this this is this is

790
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,840
real data right so this is as of may

791
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
2022 look at that look at that bottom

792
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,320
one cve 2017 1188.2

793
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,480
why are people today

794
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,240
talking about a cve from 2017

795
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,679
that's interesting

796
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,840
right that oh that that requires a

797
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,679
little bit more investigation

798
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,240
right that that's something that uh

799
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,760
that you can definitely look into and

800
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,279
you can click in and see what's

801
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,200
happening these type of these type of

802
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,120
reports exist in modern threat

803
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
intelligence vendors it's par for the

804
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,080
course another thing and all of them are

805
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,799
available via api and there's also

806
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,399
free and open source versions of these

807
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,640
things right vulnerability researchers

808
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
are really giving this back to the

809
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
community just like we are right there

810
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
there's a lot of ways that because at

811
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
the end of the day we want to protect

812
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,520
people we want to protect consumers um

813
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,840
next again is this threat intelligence

814
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,080
first of all before even before it's

815
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
actionable i'm giving you a lot of data

816
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,200
here march 20th may may 6th

817
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,559
right

818
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,039
this is a conversation happening on a

819
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,760
closed forum somebody asks originally in

820
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,399
russian uh does anyone know how to

821
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,720
launch your payload with this exploit

822
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,679
startup not visible in ah xml 64. any

823
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,520
reverse engineers in the room you know

824
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,799
exactly what's going on here they're

825
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,640
looking for an entry point right

826
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
right you know exactly what's going on

827
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
here and then

828
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
a couple months later who can who can

829
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,880
make it workable dm me i'm ready to buy

830
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,200
through s girl right these are real

831
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,159
conversations happening dude like people

832
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,200
are buying this stuff in order to have

833
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,520
remote code executable stuff

834
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
vulnerabilities that they're putting

835
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
into ransomware that they're putting

836
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,600
into their

837
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,120
different type of attack campaigns and

838
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,480
there's money behind this people are

839
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,159
buying this right there's a financial

840
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,919
transaction taking place there are

841
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,240
escrow vendors for this type of stuff if

842
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,840
you if you start talking about escrow

843
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,640
vendors the community here is so big

844
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
that you need escrow vendors right just

845
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,760
the

846
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,159
just the existence of escrow for buying

847
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,799
exploits is a huge huge deal

848
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,480
all right a little a little bit of

849
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,720
vocabulary does anyone know what any

850
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,679
means not related to anatomy

851
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,440
does anyone has anyone heard this term

852
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
before the slang term here

853
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
any no hands

854
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
it means

855
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,279
insider

856
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,120
we have our own lexicons when you're

857
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,559
following these communities these

858
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,080
communities have their own lexicons that

859
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,559
they use and these and when somebody

860
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,159
says i'm an innie that means i'm an

861
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,279
insider

862
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,480
right so in our hypothetical uh business

863
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,440
here um we are now selling credit cards

864
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
and we're now selling sim cards has

865
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
anyone heard of sim swapping

866
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,640
that's a big one right that's a huge one

867
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,960
what if i told you that people every day

868
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,799
look at the dates look at the dates of

869
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,679
when i pulled this data june 16th 2022

870
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,200
that's when i added the screenshot into

871
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
the prezzo i waited specifically i could

872
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
have done it this morning but what

873
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
people are saying here and i'm not sure

874
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,320
if you can read this on your screen any

875
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,720
up any up means i'm an insider and i'm

876
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,640
up for business that's literally what it

877
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,520
means

878
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,120
and i can tell you that this guy middle

879
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,000
of the page any up pm me if you need a

880
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,840
sim swap only number and new sim

881
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
required that guy doesn't know what he's

882
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
doing that guy is new i can tell you

883
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,600
because all you need to say is in the up

884
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,720
and if you've been doing this long

885
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
enough that's the code any up is the

886
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
code i'm ready to go you dm this person

887
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,360
and they'll do a sim swap for you

888
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,479
is this actionable

889
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,039
depending who you are

890
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,600
right let's say uh you're a 200 person

891
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,240
company that now sells sim cards uh i

892
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
don't know what if you're a

893
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,919
major telco provider

894
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,559
and you have locations all over the

895
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,039
all over the world maybe that is a

896
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,880
little bit more actionable now

897
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
and you can see what time this was

898
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,399
posted these people usually post this

899
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,080
stuff when they're starting their shift

900
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,320
they're charging 50 bucks a swap

901
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,720
right so you can get really narrow with

902
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,159
pattern of life you can see what their

903
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,240
handles are you can see when it's posted

904
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
those these blackouts in the middle of

905
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,440
the screen here

906
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
replace that blackout with your cell

907
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
phone provider that's what they're

908
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,840
saying

909
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,720
right it's a big deal it's happening

910
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,360
every single day and it's creating a big

911
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,720
big business

912
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
so we're so

913
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,039
these were all examples of our fake

914
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,880
business of selling credit cards and sim

915
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,360
cards right um how about this one

916
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,760
no political statements here just

917
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,919
looking at a at a picture first of all

918
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,120
first question is it intelligence

919
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,279
it's a picture it can be what's the

920
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,919
context right i'm going to put my my

921
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,320
intel hat on a little bit i see a

922
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,039
ukrainian vehicle two soldiers with a

923
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,799
russian flag some propaganda some

924
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,480
propaganda decals that were obviously

925
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,440
photoshopped on there right like there

926
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,200
you can tell a story without much

927
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,960
context here this was pulling from an

928
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,440
osn source if you put this

929
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,799
if you put this picture in image search

930
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,000
you'll find it

931
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
um also on the intel uh uh on the intel

932
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,679
hat here if you know what kraken 13 is

933
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,080
kraken war 13 it's a special ops unit

934
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
out of russia

935
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,279
and they're showing off that way we're

936
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,760
doing a good job here but is it intel

937
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,399
it's a picture is it intel right and

938
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,399
these type of propaganda posts happen

939
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,640
all the time hundreds of thousands of

940
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,679
images

941
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
right what are what kind of context can

942
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,360
you grab from this

943
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,200
right if you were here for the previous

944
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
talking about anomalies there's a lot of

945
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,240
talk about aiml models right

946
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,399
these are critical to modern threat

947
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
intelligence how about now what if i can

948
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
tell you

949
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,559
exactly what the image is showing

950
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,159
right what if i can

951
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,360
read

952
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,200
first of all going back here does anyone

953
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,480
see the word crack in here

954
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,399
it's not it's it's there

955
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,679
in the middle

956
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,840
right it's you can barely see it

957
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,880
but

958
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,000
over here it was off you can it's barely

959
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,720
readable but uh our ai ml model picked

960
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,799
it up we can also search for cars

961
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,679
camouflage so on and so forth again at a

962
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,640
scaled level this is a massive problem

963
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,519
right we're we have thousands of images

964
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,679
coming in per second an analyst can't

965
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,360
look at all those images all at once and

966
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,200
get a day's work done on anything you

967
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,600
need help you need ai you need ml you

968
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,799
need a good team and you need a team

969
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,000
that knows what they're doing to find

970
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,840
out false positives you also need a team

971
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,159
that doesn't have an inherent bias right

972
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,320
these are hard problems to solve they're

973
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,480
incredibly hard problems to solve but

974
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,159
this in it of itself i wouldn't call it

975
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,320
intelligence but when you derive stuff

976
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,679
from this some this you know this

977
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,200
picture might have exif data with

978
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,080
location data for example location data

979
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,320
is it actionable for us even in our

980
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
little example here we're a sim card

981
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,480
company it's not even relevant to us

982
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,080
right unless we're selling sim cards

983
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,279
into ukraine

984
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,200
unless we're selling credit cards in

985
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
ukraine and even then it might be

986
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,559
relevant to us but isn't actionable

987
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,399
no this is actionable for a different

988
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,039
type of a whole different type of client

989
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,279
how about mentions

990
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,120
if you're if you're on these forums if

991
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,960
you're in these public communities

992
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,559
people talk about stuff that's happening

993
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,480
in real time the war that's happening

994
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,599
currently in eastern europe has a lot of

995
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,280
chatter going about it you type in tick

996
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,119
tock in ukraine and the war is being

997
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
fought on tick tock people are showing

998
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
off and doing all this other stuff and

999
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,679
they're mentioning a whole bunch of

1000
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,199
stuff but there are a lot of public

1001
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,119
sources that are unobstructed meaning

1002
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,480
you don't need a username and password

1003
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,040
to get into it to to glean conversation

1004
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,599
data propaganda data so on and so forth

1005
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,320
so

1006
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,800
how do you turn that into intelligence

1007
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,760
well

1008
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,159
you know using aiml you can you

1009
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,918
absolutely can the size of the circle

1010
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,000
here means the number of mentions that

1011
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,679
big red circle that's the don esque

1012
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,760
region of ukraine a lot of fighting is

1013
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,040
happening in the donetsk region of

1014
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
ukraine a lot of people are mentioning

1015
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,040
it but what the mouse is hovering on and

1016
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,119
apologies for the pronunciation i can't

1017
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,480
pronounce that uh yes nevada the locale

1018
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,918
of yes nevada

1019
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,320
the this does has anyone heard of yes

1020
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,040
nevada before

1021
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
i haven't i have no idea what yes nevada

1022
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,720
is but 817 people are talking about it

1023
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,480
right so if you're an all-source intel

1024
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,160
analyst and you're looking for key

1025
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,680
pieces of intelligence why are

1026
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,359
817 people talking about yes nevada

1027
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,280
within the last 24 hours is something

1028
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
happening there

1029
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,280
right is this actionable

1030
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,960
maybe not for my credit card sim card

1031
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,200
company but there are people where this

1032
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,640
is actionable if there's an artillery

1033
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,240
strike happening we can get people out

1034
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
of there right like that's that that's

1035
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
real that's real stuff that's real

1036
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,280
intelligence how do we tie this all back

1037
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,079
to

1038
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,240
our sim cards our credit cards our

1039
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,839
firewalls

1040
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,320
i don't think people understand the toll

1041
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
that geopolitical

1042
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,880
conflict takes on the digital world

1043
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,480
the digital world

1044
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,359
uh

1045
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,440
usually it ebbs and flows with the

1046
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,079
geopolitical situation that's happening

1047
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,839
because of the conflict that's happening

1048
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,839
in eastern europe we're seeing attacks

1049
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,400
from both sides we're seeing ifc's

1050
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,480
coming out of the the the regions from

1051
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
both sides we're seeing

1052
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
different types of

1053
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,880
actor groups claiming responsibility for

1054
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,119
different types of attacks again

1055
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,640
this is actionable this is going

1056
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,119
directly into our firewalls if we are

1057
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,760
selling credit cards in the ukraine

1058
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
and we see a spike in these particular

1059
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,000
iocs that are coming out of ukraine we

1060
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,079
can tie that particular attack to what's

1061
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,240
going on in the geopolitical world

1062
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,000
whenever there's a massive geopolitical

1063
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,560
conflict this happens whether you see it

1064
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,040
or not this was happening before there

1065
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,839
were boots on the ground in ukraine we

1066
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,680
were seeing this type of activity

1067
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,000
happening before these people were going

1068
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,640
in

1069
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,240
right that's

1070
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,560
intelligence threat intelligence how

1071
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,760
about

1072
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,800
well let's move it back a bit because

1073
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
you know physical conflict it's super

1074
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,119
sad and all this other stuff

1075
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,040
how about a problem we all kind of kind

1076
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,560
of understand

1077
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,240
identity management

1078
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,359
right anyone here

1079
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,720
have an account that they have to log

1080
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,040
into with a password and mfa token

1081
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,320
show hands everyone that's what i

1082
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,280
thought okay so so

1083
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,160
this is a problem right uh and in our in

1084
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,640
our theoretical company we have strong

1085
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,240
we're enforcing strong user names and

1086
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
passwords we have mfa in our boxes and

1087
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,040
on our apps and we have

1088
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,480
and we have everything that we can have

1089
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
in place what about

1090
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
uh that bottom line we'll get to that in

1091
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,160
a second right so in our theoretical

1092
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,680
company we're pretty good on the

1093
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
internal management of of credentials

1094
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,640
right not not that bad but one of the

1095
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,320
problems that we always have is shadow

1096
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,839
i.t somebody with a corporate credit

1097
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,400
card wants to use this new calendar app

1098
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,320
that looks really cool and it takes all

1099
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,920
their contacts out of google and outlook

1100
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
and puts us in the new calendar and now

1101
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,000
they can do their meetings and they used

1102
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,119
the password one two three four five six

1103
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,960
all right that happens the shadow i.t

1104
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,280
stuff happens how do we how do we even

1105
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,200
begin to solve that problem it's a hard

1106
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,680
one also does anyone know how i can take

1107
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,200
over your account even if you have the

1108
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,078
top three things in place

1109
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,000
what if i stole your cookie

1110
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,040
with all your device information on it

1111
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,280
it's possible you can have all this

1112
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,599
stuff in place if i have your cookie

1113
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,520
i can get your access to your account

1114
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,599
even if you have all the stuff in place

1115
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,119
what if i can tell you

1116
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,240
that your

1117
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,680
your company's cookies are out in the

1118
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,800
wild and are being stolen by malware

1119
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,720
that's threat intelligence not only

1120
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,320
resetting usernames and passwords when

1121
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,599
they've been breached because of shadow

1122
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,400
i.t

1123
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,440
but revoking cookies in real time

1124
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,160
before malware authors can utilize your

1125
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,040
boxes to farm bitcoin or or whatever but

1126
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,480
going back to the shadow i.t problem

1127
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,839
uh can everyone see that top password

1128
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,280
this is real data from 2022.

1129
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
right so

1130
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,640
in the previous slide

1131
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,480
look at number one we enforce strong

1132
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,800
usernames and passwords we absolutely do

1133
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,960
in our business it's we gotta use our

1134
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,520
password manager the whole thing some

1135
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,760
online vendor for 99 cents a month where

1136
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,000
you can link your calendars does not you

1137
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,520
can put a password that says one two

1138
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,359
three four five six that doesn't have

1139
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,520
oauth that's not doesn't have facebook

1140
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,320
sign in it doesn't have any saml or sso

1141
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,240
on it and you can have

1142
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,000
all the crown jewels of your pii and

1143
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,079
personal information on this vendor

1144
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,760
what's blacked out here on the bottom

1145
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,920
right is a list

1146
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,760
of vendors that are not our company and

1147
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,880
these are

1148
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,800
example it's example.com but just

1149
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,960
replace your domain in there because we

1150
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,760
have that data i promise you uh you put

1151
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,920
your domain in there and you'll see the

1152
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,079
top 100 passwords that your users are

1153
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,640
using not within your environment

1154
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,720
that's a real problem is this actionable

1155
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,119
is this intelligence

1156
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,800
remember collection

1157
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,520
analysis production this is intelligence

1158
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,040
one username and password does not

1159
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
intelligence make

1160
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,200
an aggregate across what's happening the

1161
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,359
entire web now you can start having a

1162
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,560
conversation

1163
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,960
so let's dig into this problem a little

1164
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,800
bit more

1165
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,240
so over here have uh some pull outs of

1166
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,160
from the previous slide where people

1167
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,079
have their passwords what i want to call

1168
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,680
your attention to

1169
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,119
is this meets organizational profile

1170
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,000
so

1171
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
when a two slides ago when i said we

1172
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,160
enforce strong passwords that's your

1173
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,119
organizational profile i can tell you

1174
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,800
whether the passwords that we find at

1175
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,640
your vendors meet your organizational

1176
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,759
profile why is that

1177
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,560
i important somebody said it

1178
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,040
same password somebody's reusing their

1179
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,079
password at a vendor they're reusing

1180
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,400
your their own corporate password at

1181
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,680
another vendor

1182
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,280
it's i feel that that's pretty

1183
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,400
actionable

1184
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,319
right like that's that's a good one

1185
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,079
happens all the time

1186
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,160
it happens every single day

1187
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,520
so

1188
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,240
let's uh let's go to indirect matches

1189
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,400
because indirect matches is a little bit

1190
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
of a harder problem to solve

1191
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,359
right

1192
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,079
uh with indirect matches you're not

1193
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,359
finding uh your passwords you're not

1194
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,160
finding uh things that call out your

1195
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,480
little company by name this is a problem

1196
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,920
that when you're starting out in the

1197
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,359
threat intelligence space and you're a

1198
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,839
small medium business like it's really

1199
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,520
hard to start that threat intelligence

1200
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,599
practice because you might log into some

1201
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,359
vendor you might put in your company

1202
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,599
name and nothing pops up

1203
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,040
right and they're like damn i can't even

1204
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,560
do research on my own company we're too

1205
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,720
small is this even useful to me

1206
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,960
right but i bet you're using salesforce

1207
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,760
right

1208
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,480
so

1209
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,880
here's here's a ransomware dashboard

1210
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,040
right and we can tell you

1211
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,520
where the top 10 targeted industries by

1212
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,960
different ransomware authors remember

1213
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,319
when we were talking about a couple

1214
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,400
slides ago ukraine certain types of iocs

1215
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,280
come out of certain types of

1216
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,079
geopolitical conflicts ransomware actors

1217
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,160
like going around certain industries

1218
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,760
because there are certain standards in

1219
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,240
certain industries that everyone knows

1220
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,920
rest in peace internet explorer it's

1221
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,079
been a good it's been a good 27 years

1222
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,760
thank you very much for my career and

1223
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,079
everybody else's career in this room but

1224
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,960
there's that swift terminal at that bank

1225
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
with the bloomberg terminal on it that's

1226
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,720
running ie7 i guarantee you right and

1227
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,200
and there are a lot of uh uh

1228
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,520
targeted industries meat packing from

1229
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,560
aerospace to retail they use kind of the

1230
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,359
same software across all these types of

1231
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,440
industries what this is telling me as a

1232
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,359
small vendor where i can't find my own

1233
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,400
name here

1234
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,839
i can tell you

1235
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,680
your supply chain

1236
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,960
is borked

1237
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,800
right i can tell you

1238
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,839
not only

1239
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
if your supply chain is hit the

1240
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,760
something like this has the power and

1241
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,000
this is a very real example

1242
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
we can tell our vendors that they've

1243
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
been breached before they know that they

1244
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,520
have been breached

1245
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,079
because ransomware actors put this stuff

1246
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,400
up for public consumption they like to

1247
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,359
brag

1248
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,280
right they zip these files and say i

1249
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,520
breached this company right and we and

1250
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
that happens even if you're not finding

1251
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,720
your name in a threat intelligence

1252
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,319
vendor i guarantee you that threat

1253
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,480
intelligence vendor has the password of

1254
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,240
your supply chain i guarantee you that

1255
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,839
threat intelligence

1256
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,160
intelligence vendor has information

1257
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,920
about ransomware that is reaching your

1258
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
supply chain supply chain is very

1259
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,760
important in the last few years how many

1260
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,960
people have to wait for a car for the

1261
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,280
next three years these days right

1262
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,520
formula shortage toilet paper sorted so

1263
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,680
on and so forth right these are

1264
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,880
uh

1265
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,319
these are things that we're all dealing

1266
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,119
with that have some sort of digital

1267
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,760
impact right uh going back to stocks

1268
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
next it's not like plc's aren't being

1269
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,839
attacked anymore on major ships

1270
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,079
that's still happening right so your

1271
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,160
supply chain is super important how

1272
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,960
about

1273
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,200
vulnerability intelligence

1274
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
that's that's another one what if i told

1275
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,640
you there are three vulnerabilities in

1276
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,839
your supply chain that don't have cves i

1277
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,240
guarantee you that i can tell you that

1278
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,720
there are vulnerabilities in your supply

1279
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,119
chain that don't have cves and i can

1280
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,800
also tell you that one of them has a

1281
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,040
remote code execution

1282
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,480
there's a difference between data and

1283
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,800
intelligence this is intelligence this

1284
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,480
is vulnerability intelligence if any of

1285
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,000
you guys talked to jake coons in the

1286
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,079
last 10 years he'll tell you all about

1287
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:20,960
this

1288
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,400
right this is

1289
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,040
very real stuff this is not only for

1290
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,119
your vendor supply chain so you can you

1291
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,000
can

1292
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,319
discover in your own stack

1293
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,839
where these vulnerabilities uh are and

1294
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,680
is this even actionable if you're

1295
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,200
waiting on microsoft to patch something

1296
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,280
that has an rce

1297
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,560
is this even actionable for you guys

1298
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,680
can it be

1299
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,119
yeah maybe you can take that system off

1300
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,040
the internet unless it's a money making

1301
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,200
system then you have to migrate it how

1302
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,960
long do you have to wait for a patch

1303
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,800
there are compensating and remediating

1304
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
controls that you can take but this is

1305
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,040
actionable depending on your budget

1306
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,880
right like maybe for our small 200

1307
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,400
person company this might be a little

1308
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,440
hard

1309
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,520
but for bigger organizations it has to

1310
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,880
be actionable

1311
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,319
so

1312
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,319
that is uh that is what threat

1313
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,720
intelligence looks like in 2022

1314
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,319
it came from a world of understanding

1315
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,200
hint

1316
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,880
again call out to mark arnold's talk

1317
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,520
from 2018 on hacking intelligence

1318
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,359
when has has anyone seen these terms

1319
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,560
before human geowent finance osint

1320
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,800
siegent these are common terms used in

1321
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,440
the physical industry

1322
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,839
in law enforcement agencies and

1323
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,680
in federal agencies human intelligence

1324
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,920
remember i gave the example of the case

1325
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,640
officer going to the factory worker

1326
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,200
that's human intelligence how about this

1327
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,280
is this human intelligence me having a

1328
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,880
conversation with a threat actor on the

1329
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,200
forum

1330
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,720
right it's not human in the same way as

1331
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,480
me talk paying some factory worker for

1332
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,640
some from for some data but with enough

1333
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,160
context here

1334
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,480
you can you can glean a lot here

1335
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,240
how about how about that doughnut regen

1336
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,800
stuff is that geo intelligence

1337
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,160
when when these guys are talking about

1338
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,359
geo intelligence they're moving

1339
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,839
satellites my sim card company my credit

1340
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,599
card company can't move a satellite it's

1341
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,359
a little bit out of our budget

1342
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,520
but uh but i can tell you what mentions

1343
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,800
are happening where we're selling credit

1344
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,000
cards

1345
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,280
that might be genuine how about mass

1346
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,800
ends mass is measurement intelligence

1347
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
and this is an oversimplification but i

1348
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,760
can measure how much loss you have in

1349
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,079
your credit cards in the last seven days

1350
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,400
it's a real oversimplification but it's

1351
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,839
kind of analogous

1352
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,319
o ascent is something we all use is a

1353
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,720
super important how about this picture

1354
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
is it even intelligence right is that

1355
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,079
cyber intelligence is it finn

1356
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,280
intelligence

1357
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,359
right again with the raw analyst hat

1358
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,040
with the right context and uh and a mass

1359
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,400
of these things it can be the right

1360
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,079
intelligence but what i want to propose

1361
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,119
here

1362
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,680
is that these end concepts don't

1363
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,359
translate very well to the digital world

1364
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,880
we have to start thinking of the digital

1365
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,800
world in a little bit of a different way

1366
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,480
and i have to give a shout out to jake

1367
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,319
coons and matt howell people i work with

1368
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,079
and we've been thinking about how we

1369
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,839
have to change the ontologies of the

1370
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,920
stuff that we're talking about

1371
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,720
right it's all intelligence

1372
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,319
but these are broken down into way

1373
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,599
different intelligence threat

1374
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,119
intelligence it's not the source it's

1375
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,760
not the same as open source intelligence

1376
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,359
awesome

1377
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,440
it's it's it's still here it's a good

1378
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
one it is its own thing but deep and

1379
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,119
dark web intelligence is not the same as

1380
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,960
regular threat intelligence if you have

1381
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,559
to get through a password or to an onion

1382
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,480
site that's a way different collection

1383
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,319
profile than if you just go to a new

1384
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,000
site and scrape it very different

1385
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,680
vulnerability intelligence i can tell

1386
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,680
you you have a vulnerability before nvd

1387
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,000
can that's intelligence identity

1388
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,680
intelligence we just did password attack

1389
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,119
surface management that could be

1390
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,520
physical that could be digital financial

1391
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,119
intelligence i can tell you how much

1392
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,800
fraud loss you have in your credit cards

1393
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,119
etc etc we have to start thinking about

1394
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,599
intelligence as concepts and ontologies

1395
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,680
in a different way this physical stuff

1396
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,359
it's useful there's very there's a lot

1397
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,000
of overlap we have customers and and

1398
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,839
client clients and

1399
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,839
uh and people that we help using these

1400
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,680
types of concepts but in our digital

1401
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,680
world we have to

1402
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,960
start thinking about it a little bit

1403
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,079
different because there's always going

1404
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,000
to be overlap there's always going to be

1405
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,760
a human element i want to call out that

1406
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,440
last one so your security community

1407
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,040
intelligence the best type of

1408
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,599
intelligence you can get is hi i'm a

1409
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,200
bank i got hit with this piece of

1410
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,359
ransomware that uh

1411
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,760
that's a trick bot that's a like tiny

1412
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,520
banker and i'm going to give you the

1413
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
yara rules and signatures to every other

1414
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,599
bank in my mailing list that's one of

1415
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,359
the best kind of intelligence sharing

1416
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,440
intelligence is probably the best way

1417
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,640
that our digital communal immune system

1418
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,040
works right we can't keep the stuff to

1419
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,440
ourselves we have to share this stuff so

1420
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,680
it's not is threat intelligence

1421
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,319
actionable in 2022. that was that's kind

1422
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,559
of a joke the real question is is

1423
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,400
intelligence

1424
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,079
is intelligence

1425
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,319
actionable i think all intelligence is

1426
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,880
actionable data may not be actionable

1427
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,440
intelligence is actionable

1428
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,400
and

1429
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,079
that's time thank you very much

1430
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,820
everybody

1431
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:04,559
[Applause]

1432
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,559
so i think we have a couple minutes for

1433
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,040
questions

1434
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,599
easy right no questions all right that's

1435
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,720
what i thought

1436
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,319
all right thank you everybody i'll be

1437
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,480
around if you guys want to talk to me

1438
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,040
thanks again cheers

1439
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,670
[Applause]

1440
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,440
you
