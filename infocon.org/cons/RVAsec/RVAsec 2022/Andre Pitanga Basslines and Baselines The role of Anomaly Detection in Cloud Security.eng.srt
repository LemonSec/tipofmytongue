1
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
all right we got a good group of people

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,920
here

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
we are here today to talk about anomaly

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
detection so thank you for

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
making it in here

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,599
you could be anywhere you could be at

7
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,680
the bar it's a bit early for the bar i'm

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,480
the last thing between you and lunch

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
so um anomaly detection you know this is

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
an intro talk i'm not going to get super

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,040
deep into

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,120
machine learning it doesn't really

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,079
expect any previous knowledge

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,239
it's meant to really introduce the

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,000
concept of anomaly detection because

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
after all you see it everywhere right i

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,559
was talking to some folks in the vendor

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,280
hall so many products that have anomaly

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
detection as one of the key parts of the

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,879
product or the technology of the

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,399
innovation

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
um and so yeah so thank you for being

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,760
here i'm i'm andre i've

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
been sort of in the devops devsecop

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
space for my whole career 10 plus years

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
was a red hat for many years as a

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,320
consultant

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,840
traveling all over the place now i'm

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,479
working for a startup talking to

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
teams of all sizes that are doing cloud

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
native stuff whether they built their

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,799
companies on cloud native stacks

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,680
migrating critical workloads there and

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
seeing what's working and what's not

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
working and

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,880
i've really become interested i've been

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,840
doing server hardening and sort of like

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,000
cis standard and diesel sig

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,079
automating security automating hardening

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,000
automating vulnerability patching and

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
stuff like that

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
uh but you know it never quite got to um

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
that ideal place right actually you can

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,920
never get to an ideal place but it never

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
it was always like a sisifian task where

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
you're constantly patching going back

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,520
trying to shift left and all of that to

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
achieve security but a lot of people

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
that i've been talking to are still kind

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
of struggling to to make sense of that

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
so the point of this talk is that i've

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,080
really started to research a lot about

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
anomaly detection

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,920
and i decided to share a little bit of

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,200
what i learned i've been reading some of

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,959
the research papers

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
talking to people that have anomaly

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,040
detection as part of their products and

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
um you know learning a little bit and i

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,440
want to share with you all

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
so a couple of things that i want to

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
cover today is why anomaly detection

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
specifically for cloud security right

64
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,080
analytic detection has been around for a

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
couple of decades you've seen it in the

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,480
network space fraud detection a lot of

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
different areas

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
but how does it fit within the world of

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
cloud security and cloud native

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
applications

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
so for that we're going to step back

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
really quickly and look at the history

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,599
of anomaly detection for intrusion

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,959
detection

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,760
sort of why was this created do the

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
reasons for which it was created still

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,760
makes sense in this cloud native

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
paradigm right

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
quickly look at a typical model right a

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
typical anomaly detection for intrusion

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,040
detection model

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,879
and sort of look at the benefits right

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,440
what does it promise to bring to the

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,959
cloud security sort of arena right

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,239
um and you know no technology no

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
innovation is without its flaws and

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,760
without its challenges right it's not

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
about trying to find some sort of

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
panacea or anything like that we're

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,599
gonna take a look at the practical

91
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,400
challenges right um you know if i look

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
at the promise and all the benefits that

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
it can bring for your company for your

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
organization or for your to your

95
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
practice as an individual practitioner

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,000
um you know why isn't it more widespread

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
today why why hasn't it solved the

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
problem already so we're going to take a

99
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,120
look at that

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
there's been some challenges to the

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
anomaly detection model as well to the

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
sort of anomaly detection paradigm we're

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,920
going to quickly take a look at that and

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
take a look at the evolution of anomaly

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
detection there's been a lot of advance

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
over the past couple of years past few

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
years taking some of the look at some of

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,439
the things that are making it more real

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,560
than ever

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
and

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,799
you know

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,159
really have a real world impact

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,519
so why anomaly detection for cloud

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,839
security and why now right so why does

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680
it matter right why should i care about

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
this right

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,800
um you know cloud security is way more

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
complicated than the sort of paradigm

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,919
that we inherited from on-prem right if

120
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,199
you look at the trip you know when i

121
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,040
started as a sys admin as a devops

122
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,400
practitioner

123
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
it was you know put the server here

124
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
right apache lamp servers whatever the

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
server may be right and you leave it

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
there in a rack for a year right patch

127
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
it maybe

128
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,520
you do patch it right but it's gonna be

129
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,080
there that static ip is gonna be there

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,759
right you can protect it because you

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,160
understand it really well you can harden

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
it and it's your baby right hand crafted

133
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
cloud security is way different right

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
especially cloud native applications

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,080
that are being developed nowadays the

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,759
typical application

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,880
is going to be deployed as a

138
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
microservice you know frequently a bunch

139
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,759
of small little services that are

140
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,680
running in kubernetes

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
running as functions as a service

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
it has all kinds of funky auto scaling

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
happening all the time that's

144
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,560
one of the reasons why a lot of people

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
are migrating

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,039
to um kubernetes frameworks and if you

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
look at you know just microservices

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,759
architecture itself there's a lot more

149
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,000
interconnection right there's a lot more

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,160
network traffic you know as you look at

151
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,919
these auto scaling situations there's a

152
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
more a lot more dynamic ips

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
so in other words the

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
it's a lot more complex to even

155
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
understand what you're trying to secure

156
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
right things are more ephemeral and

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,440
there's a larger risk surface

158
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,600
and you know this is actually

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
not a solved problem in our industry

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
right cloud security by any means right

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,759
so you know everybody here has job

162
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,840
security assured for many many years

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,720
because

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
you know like one research group of

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,680
researchers did a scan over the like

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
this year at the turn of the year

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,440
uh 72

168
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
of the cloud configurations that they uh

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,880
scanned

170
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
75 of the organizations

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,400
had

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,800
uh 72 percent had flaws right had

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,039
misconfigurations like open s3 buckets

174
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:29,919
right

175
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,199
um security groups that quad zero

176
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,680
you know world world re road readable

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,000
world writable stuff right

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,880
real problem and this is being exploited

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,840
a lot right cloud environments are a

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
massive target right now

181
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
and um you know there's more and more

182
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,479
zero-day vulnerabilities right all the

183
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
time i mean maybe we're discovering them

184
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,919
we're doing a better job of discovering

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,639
them uh but you know uh google's project

186
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,520
zero was reporting you know 2021 was a

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
record-breaking year i'm sure i'm not

188
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,919
going to say i'm sure but

189
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,240
it is likely that this could be the case

190
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
in 2022 as well right so it is critical

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
right it is a critic what we're doing as

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
professionals is incredibly important

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,560
right i think you know most people could

194
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,800
say that their organization

195
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
are all in on cloud

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,440
strongly migrating to cloud right and

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,160
it's not a solved problem so solutions

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,599
are needed

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
but you may say oh we had solutions

200
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,280
right we had signature based tools

201
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,000
that can protect our environment that we

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,319
know and love right

203
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
yes we can right but it's not always

204
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
hitting the target right this is where

205
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
i've been talking to a lot of teams as a

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,360
consultant and as a solution architect

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
and they tell me you know it's very hard

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
right as an analyst just putting my

209
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,800
analyst hat on right because

210
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
you know say i want to protect my

211
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
kubernetes clusters right and then i'll

212
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,759
have product x y and z and they'll say

213
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,879
we have 400 rules we have 500 rules i

214
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
have 2 000 rules i win you know

215
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,319
and it's great you know it's great but

216
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
the problem is you get all of those

217
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,919
rules right you download the rule set

218
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,080
you apply against your cluster against

219
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
your environment and this even applies

220
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
to cis standard and some other things

221
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,120
right then the app doesn't run right the

222
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
server the service doesn't run right and

223
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
then what do i do i have to go through

224
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,919
the process of i'm gonna suppress this

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,159
rule right i'm gonna make sure that this

226
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
rule is applied

227
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,880
it's a lot of work right and it ends up

228
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
being a human being

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,640
that has to decide what to suppress what

230
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,839
to allow

231
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,920
and as a security analyst i don't

232
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
necessarily fully understand the

233
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,480
application stack or that cluster how it

234
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,519
was built right so you know if you

235
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,200
tighten it too much

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,519
you you know you start getting a ton of

237
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,800
false alerts right false positives

238
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
very common how many false alerts you

239
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,360
get in a day a hundred right and then

240
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,440
people start even checking right stop

241
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
checking the siem of course you don't

242
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
want to do that but it does become a

243
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,279
problem right

244
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
so you know

245
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
that is

246
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,080
you know hasn't really solved the

247
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
problem right cves are out there we

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,760
patch the cvs that's great you know but

249
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
do we always why are we are we ever able

250
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
to achieve 100

251
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
you know coverage within that month

252
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
before the flood starts all over again

253
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,560
right

254
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
so that's the thing you know and

255
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,680
signature based um security right is

256
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
where i have like you know a signature

257
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,320
for a malware a cv number assigned to

258
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
that package right to a vulnerability

259
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,080
that's found in a package

260
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,360
um that's all great right but a lot of

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
exploits that happen in the real world

262
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,440
especially more complex ones that really

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,519
threaten the health of the business

264
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,560
end up um being zero day attacks right

265
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,279
where a signature doesn't even exist yet

266
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,959
that's something that happens a lot

267
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,480
right and you know just signature alone

268
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
is not solving the cloud security

269
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,800
problem

270
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
so let's take a look at what anomaly

271
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,160
detection is and again this is an

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,040
introductory you know talk so if you

273
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,480
never heard about anomaly detect i mean

274
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
you probably heard of it but you never

275
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
really studied it you're what you're in

276
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,959
the right place that's where you're

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
gonna start if you know a lot about it

278
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
let's talk about it and and we can all

279
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,240
learn together

280
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
so anomalies right so first of all let's

281
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,760
the lingo and the jargon right what's

282
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,079
anomaly detection well what's an anomaly

283
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
right so an anomaly just comes from data

284
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,600
science right and i found this really

285
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
decent um description which is basically

286
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,519
a data point that's different

287
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,320
from others in terms of its features

288
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,519
or they're rare in a data set right

289
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,680
they're odd things that happen every

290
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
once in a while there are things that

291
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,360
behaviors and things that look different

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,079
than the norm

293
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,120
so you know looking at anomalies

294
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
where did you know where do we start we

295
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
as an industry cyber security where did

296
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
you know we started using these models

297
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
to protect our environments right this

298
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,320
is basically a lot of the credit goes to

299
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
dorothy denning

300
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,640
in the late 80s created the first sort

301
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,440
of statistics you know statistical model

302
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
a complete model

303
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
to create intrusion detection an

304
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
intrusion detection system based on

305
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
anomaly detection

306
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
anomaly yes exactly

307
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,279
so the idea that she had was that in the

308
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,560
hypothesis behind the whole

309
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
research right and the whole commercial

310
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
application of anomaly detection comes

311
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
from the idea that the exploitation of a

312
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,519
system vulnerability involves abnormal

313
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,639
usage

314
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,600
right

315
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
there's a lot of logic to that right so

316
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
think about it this way

317
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
if everybody is using that system the

318
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
way it was architected and it was

319
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
supposed to be used we wouldn't have a

320
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,399
problem right developers will log in

321
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,680
develop code commit to the repo

322
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,720
create an image right push the image

323
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,440
requests will come from the outside

324
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
front end would talk to the database and

325
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,240
everything would be copacetic right

326
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,720
when things are misused

327
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,279
you know and when things are malicious

328
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,200
you know when nobody's programming or

329
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
architecting for malicious activity

330
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,519
right so if we can detect something that

331
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,240
is

332
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,959
outside of what that pattern should be

333
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,480
then there's a good chance that that

334
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
could be malicious activity and that was

335
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,040
the basis of the model right there were

336
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,399
some i there were some um usage of uh

337
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
statistical anomaly detection

338
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
in sort of factories and in the

339
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,839
industrial sector before right you know

340
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,760
you're looking at uh you know airplanes

341
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,000
or the you know uh production line and

342
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,920
seeing things that are outside of that

343
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
statistical model like that curve right

344
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
but uh dorothy then was the first one

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
that created a full model that kind of

346
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
put that all together

347
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,399
in what could actually ended up being

348
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,880
created um intrusion detection systems

349
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
that protected very critical national

350
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
systems for many many many years and is

351
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
the basis of everything else that's come

352
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,000
after that

353
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
the cool thing about this model that she

354
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
created was that it doesn't

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,639
necessarily apply to any specific system

356
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,160
or application

357
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
right it's a conceptual model and it's a

358
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
way that you can reuse into a lot of

359
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
things right and and that's actually

360
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,240
something that's really powerful to

361
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
where we are today we're going to get

362
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,680
that in a second right

363
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,839
how um

364
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,000
flexible this model is right that's

365
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,279
something that can really benefit our

366
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,040
industry as we go

367
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,800
and one of the things that has been

368
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,399
there from the beginning as you're

369
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,399
thinking about anomaly detection is that

370
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,800
it's an extra layer of protection right

371
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,399
i'm not here saying like let's stop

372
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
doing signature based detection

373
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
absolutely not right that's a must-have

374
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,199
right we still need to um pursue those

375
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,120
vulnerabilities we still need to harden

376
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
our systems we still need to adopt all

377
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
of those best practices

378
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,320
but

379
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
this would be an additional layer that

380
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
is very very important

381
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
why why is it very very important we

382
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
talked a little bit about it right but

383
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,920
one of the things that i wanted to bring

384
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
to this talk today was the idea that she

385
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,959
had some original motivations to create

386
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,880
anomaly detection

387
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,639
anomaly detection for intrusion

388
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,839
detection

389
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,360
and i wanted to take a look at do these

390
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,000
still apply to cloud security to cloud

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,880
native security right like maybe this

392
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
model is outdated right it doesn't

393
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,000
really make sense for our industry

394
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,399
anymore i think that it does right

395
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,639
so if we look at it the motivation

396
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,199
around it was that

397
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
in the beginning it was almost

398
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
impossible you know she believed that it

399
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
was very difficult right to find and fix

400
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,000
all of these deficiencies for technical

401
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
and economic reasons is that still true

402
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
today

403
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
absolutely right if you go to the

404
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
commercial sector and you talk to

405
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,320
customers they are constantly

406
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,399
in the hamster wheel of addressing

407
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
vulnerabilities you know it's almost you

408
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,680
know then people like i need

409
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
vulnerability automation right you know

410
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,399
and yes that's great we can do ansible

411
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,399
we can do all of those things but the

412
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,040
thing is that that's costly

413
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
right i'm actually spending all that

414
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
time working on that stuff fixing those

415
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,160
flaws and not working on other activity

416
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,040
and guess what i create a secure image

417
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,199
now my developers say yeah you know like

418
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
we can't really we got a sprint that

419
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
we're working on we can't really make

420
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,399
changes to the system right now right or

421
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,360
wrong

422
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,800
right you know so this is absolutely a

423
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
true statement that hasn't changed in 40

424
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,519
years

425
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,759
right very prescient i think the work

426
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
that she did

427
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
so the other thing this is very much

428
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,279
along the lines of what i was talking

429
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,000
about right even when we know and we

430
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,160
found the flaws

431
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,519
in the system

432
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
it's not easy to replace it

433
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,639
you know how many times do is it i know

434
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
i know i know about that system is just

435
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,160
don't touch it please you know leave it

436
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,959
there

437
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
right very very common why

438
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
the developer left we don't have the

439
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,279
source code right i don't have the time

440
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
you know it you know

441
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,279
and for economic reasons i like how she

442
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,040
called out economic reasons right we're

443
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,959
running a business right we're running

444
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
an organization we have only so many

445
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,680
people working right so many hours in a

446
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,399
day right it becomes very very difficult

447
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,639
to replace systems even if i know

448
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,959
they're flawed

449
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,040
and well okay great so let's do

450
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,440
greenfield let's develop new things and

451
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,560
we'll develop

452
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,199
develop and perfectly secure

453
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,040
right i see

454
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
so

455
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
don't laugh you know what i mean that is

456
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,680
a belief but but you know it's not

457
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,480
really possible right is it impossible

458
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
i don't know that it's impossible right

459
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,399
it's possible like in a sense that

460
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
people are doing shift left right

461
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
they're embedding security into the

462
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,880
pipeline right they're then doing static

463
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,319
code analysis

464
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
they're doing iac scanning right

465
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
infrastructure is code scanning they're

466
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,559
doing vulnerability scanning you know

467
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,319
during the build phase so you don't push

468
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,400
that stuff out to production right you

469
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,559
don't deploy that to your clusters and

470
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,799
then when i do deploy it i you know

471
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,599
constantly scan it in the runtime so it

472
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,240
is but it's extremely difficult right

473
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
and again you know the economics play

474
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
into that right i'm all about

475
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
you know sending out new features that

476
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
are going to map up to my marketing

477
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
roadmap and that are ultimately going to

478
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
generate income so i can keep everyone

479
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,440
employed right

480
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
so these you can see

481
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,039
40 something years ago and those

482
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,880
assumptions are very much still part of

483
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
our

484
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,799
uh context

485
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,280
and this is a good one too by 40

486
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,840
something years ago even the most secure

487
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
systems are vulnerable to abused by

488
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,200
insiders who misuse their privileges

489
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
right zero trust anyone right 40

490
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
something years ago it's still true

491
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,039
right still very much true the system is

492
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,200
perfectly you know the the doors are

493
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,720
locked the windows are locked right but

494
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
um you know the people that are inside

495
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,880
the house you know

496
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
very common it can exfiltrate data you

497
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,120
know you know the deal

498
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,400
so these

499
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,919
assumptions that dorothy did you know

500
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,559
underpin the research and the model i

501
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
think are still very much valid for the

502
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
cloud native paradigm

503
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,240
so quickly looking at a model and you

504
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,280
know

505
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
um this is a generic model she created

506
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,919
this using just statistics right and

507
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,440
these are some of the components that go

508
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,559
into essentially every mod every um tool

509
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,640
to this day right and we're going to map

510
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,960
this out also to cloud native and cloud

511
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,320
infrastructure

512
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,960
to see how these appear in that context

513
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,559
right so the six components are subjects

514
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,919
right

515
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,440
service accounts

516
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,559
human accounts api keys right these are

517
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
the things that are these are the actors

518
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
if you will right in that cloud

519
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,400
environment right

520
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,760
very much still a thing right iam active

521
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,160
directory you know these are things that

522
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
are um

523
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
very difficult to protect

524
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,679
right there's there's a lot of you know

525
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,840
there's whole tools and marketplace for

526
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,039
credential

527
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,960
sort of like least privilege right

528
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,559
making sure that people are not allowed

529
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
to overly protect

530
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,720
they want to give root pseudo to

531
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
everybody right but sometimes we do

532
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,600
right

533
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,320
so objects objects with the resources

534
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,480
right so in the cloud context these

535
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,400
would be ec2s elbs right elastic globe

536
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,520
you know load balancers right subnets

537
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
these will be uh you know inside of

538
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
kubernetes it would be the cluster the

539
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
you know the pod the container right we

540
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,240
have to be able to kind of identify

541
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,799
those and classify those as objects in

542
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,039
the model right

543
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,280
audit records essentially these are

544
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,360
going to be um you know what we're

545
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,640
consuming to create that model

546
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
right so like how can i know you know

547
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,440
what is you know the standard behavior

548
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,679
and what's anomalous

549
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,000
more often than not i'm reading logs

550
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,039
right i'm reading cloud trail you know

551
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,039
logs from aws i'm reading gcp audit logs

552
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
i'm reading you know kubernetes audit

553
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,799
logs i'm tapping into audit d inside a

554
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,200
linux system right i'm tapping into

555
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
these different resources to build this

556
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
model and the model essentially is the

557
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,120
profiles right so the profiles will be

558
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,679
who's talking to who right what's

559
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,159
happening in a given time frame so if

560
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,120
you look at um these resources as nodes

561
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,320
in the graph

562
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,799
right and in the connections between

563
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,039
these nodes as

564
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,240
essentially you know edges right in this

565
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,360
graph you know that's basically as i i

566
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
can start building a visual essentially

567
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,039
a logical model of behaviors by looking

568
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,039
at what resources are communicating to

569
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,720
which resources

570
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
uh and that creates a profile you know

571
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
in originally she did that based on a

572
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,280
template but now there's more modern

573
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,600
ways to create this profi profile and

574
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,679
update the profile right because things

575
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
change you know i mentioned in the

576
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,280
beginning that cloud native

577
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,039
you know velocity and the speed of

578
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,679
change is so critical right we want to

579
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
you know now people are shipping code

580
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,400
on a daily basis on a weekly basis

581
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
bug fixes and features

582
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
uh records right okay so i found an

583
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,760
anomaly right that's going to trigger an

584
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,520
event or an alert

585
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
right and it's going to go to different

586
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
channels depending on where that's going

587
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,000
and activity rules is the idea of you

588
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
can use it for a variety of things one

589
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,520
of the things that's commonly used

590
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
is to produce a report right to um

591
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,280
trigger some auto remediation

592
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,919
right i can call you know a web hook to

593
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
address something right i know i noticed

594
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
something

595
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
very unusual and potentially malicious i

596
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
made sense of that in my model i may

597
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
want to try to communicate to the aws

598
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,159
api and change the security rule to you

599
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,240
know close a port right that may be one

600
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,080
thing i want to do

601
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
so that's the model and incredibly i've

602
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,640
i've worked to you know i've

603
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
been pretty intimate with

604
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,720
one of the cutting edge models right now

605
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,000
um with a company called lacework and

606
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,880
you know

607
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
a lot of the stuff is still that way you

608
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,120
know i looked at other vendors as well

609
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,200
did a bunch of research and a lot of

610
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
this stuff is still very much done this

611
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,840
way you know so again this research has

612
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,640
really been influential and and um you

613
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,080
know a huge leap forward

614
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
so to give an example a more real world

615
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
example you know i said this talk was

616
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,039
going to be introductory right all

617
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,360
levels so the idea is think of securing

618
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
a house right let's compare signature

619
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,559
based protection and anomaly based

620
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,080
detection

621
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,159
looking at a house right so i want to

622
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,960
protect my house right i work with adt

623
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,120
or some other company i put um you know

624
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
locks on the doors i have keychain

625
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,000
touchpad maybe for my garage or for my

626
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,360
door sometimes

627
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
you know each person in my house my son

628
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,880
has one my my wife has one right i make

629
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
sure that all the windows have alert you

630
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,000
have alarms right that's essentially the

631
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,240
the you know the the signature based

632
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,720
stuff right that's my cis standard right

633
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,440
that's my my my stig right where i'm

634
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
saying make sure that root is not

635
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
allowed to log in you know you you know

636
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,640
using a password right these are all

637
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,039
those checkpoints that every house

638
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,120
should have quote unquote right

639
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,200
cool right but the thing is that what if

640
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
someone you know my son coming back from

641
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,000
school drops the keys on the floor right

642
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
and then someone comes into the house

643
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,360
using that right then i will be able to

644
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,600
there's no rules against that my son is

645
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,640
allowed to

646
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
to

647
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
come into the house at any time right

648
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
there's not a window maybe my gardener

649
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
can you know use the key to open the

650
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
gate to the backyard

651
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,360
you know monday through friday you know

652
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,080
9 a.m to 10 10 a.m right my son can do

653
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,039
it at any time but i can know my son's

654
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,000
behavior right he comes home from school

655
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
he goes to do his homework then he goes

656
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,159
to play video games normally he spends

657
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,880
time in the you know living room etc but

658
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,960
then i see that the person that used my

659
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,440
son's key came in went to the master

660
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,400
bedroom

661
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,600
and started poking in the drawers in a

662
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,640
closet

663
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
right

664
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,400
that's unusual that's an anomaly right

665
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,159
that's potentially malicious that's why

666
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,240
i'm going to bring this up so one of the

667
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,400
things that we need to start seeing here

668
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,760
is that this needs to be individualized

669
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,559
right

670
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,320
cis standard

671
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,799
disa sig boostig

672
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
everybody should be doing these things

673
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,600
right everybody who's operating on aws

674
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,799
you use the cis aws standard right but

675
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
the thing is that each house is

676
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,799
different how my family operates is

677
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,200
different than how my neighbor's family

678
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,039
operates right

679
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,600
you know so for example you know maybe

680
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,159
my son you know goes to the medicine

681
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
cabinet to get the asthma thing but you

682
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,799
know that other person doesn't the

683
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,640
neighbor doesn't so it's going to be

684
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,320
common for my son to be going into the

685
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,240
medicine cabinet but then all of a

686
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,480
sudden i see an eight-year-old child in

687
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,679
my neighbor in their house you going to

688
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,360
the medicine cabinet

689
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,960
why why is he going to the medicine cat

690
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,559
he's eight years old he doesn't you know

691
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
you get the point right so that's

692
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,520
anomaly detection it's really it's it's

693
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
giving me something beyond these normal

694
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,480
detections and these usual standards

695
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,520
right

696
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,799
um so

697
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,080
pulling this into the cloud arena right

698
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
let's look at this example here right

699
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,320
this is essentially a model right

700
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,400
essentially a baseline i said the name

701
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,679
of the talk is baselines and baseline i

702
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,880
don't know how many people came for the

703
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,480
music part or how many people came for

704
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,919
the security part

705
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,440
i think the security of majority of

706
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
people probably you know but but um so

707
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,120
this is a baseline right i basically

708
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
built a logical model

709
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,320
of the operations of my

710
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,120
cloud my application my kubernetes

711
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,000
cluster here i have these two accounts

712
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,279
right connecting to the aws api

713
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,840
through these geographic locations

714
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,720
right

715
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,120
portland oregon columbus ohio i have

716
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,559
employees there

717
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
right i don't know all of a sudden

718
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,039
getting you know connections from japan

719
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
okay maybe you know somebody's on

720
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,799
vacation in japan and they're connecting

721
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,120
to the vpn right

722
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,440
which which which uh you know which

723
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,240
service principles i'm using right which

724
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,559
credentials i'm using right what are the

725
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,679
resources that i'm affect um utilizing

726
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,919
in which regions right some people don't

727
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
even have applications in multi-regions

728
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,919
right then all of a sudden i'm detecting

729
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,120
that people are launching all these

730
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,600
stacks on this other region a crypto

731
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,240
miner or whatever right

732
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,840
so this is a typical model of what it

733
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,760
will look like and these are the nodes

734
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,919
and the relationships between the nodes

735
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,799
to alert me and advise me and give me

736
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,600
insights about my individualized model

737
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,399
right

738
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,600
prod is going to be different than

739
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,679
qa than dev

740
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,279
right so i have to be able to build

741
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
these models

742
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,480
for the different environments where i'm

743
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,279
doing compute

744
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,840
so you know relating to music you know

745
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,760
it's not a huge thing right but but it's

746
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
like you know if you look at the bass

747
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,600
line you know for those of you that like

748
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
music you know it's really sort of the

749
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,919
the glue that kind of glues the whole

750
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,799
track together the song together right

751
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,360
it's really the bass that's like driving

752
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,039
that song and then dynamic along with

753
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,600
the rhythm right but you know i pulled

754
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
out a quote about groove right it's a

755
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,320
feel that's created by a repeating

756
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,120
framework but also contains variations

757
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
right that's kind of like us right we're

758
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,960
creating these applications and these

759
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
services to serve our businesses and to

760
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
serve our community as the case may be

761
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,440
right and when things are working nicely

762
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
everybody's operating you know according

763
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
to that underlying infrastructure

764
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
everything is groovy right everything is

765
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,159
good but all of a sudden if you hit the

766
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,159
wrong notes that can throw the groove

767
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,880
out right that's the idea of baseline

768
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,919
detection and really understanding your

769
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,480
services your applications your

770
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,039
different topologies to

771
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,039
you know bring up better security

772
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,679
insights and make you more effective as

773
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,880
security professionals

774
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,559
so you know good you know we know that

775
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
there is a problem in cloud security

776
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,039
cloud security is not a solved problem

777
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,120
right there is a need for new tools and

778
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,559
new approaches

779
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,480
anomaly detection seems like it still

780
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,159
would make sense for this cloud native

781
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,880
paradigm right we get a basic sense of

782
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,679
what an anomaly detection model is right

783
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,399
so

784
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,159
what's the benefit right i think it

785
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,520
touched on that a little bit but i want

786
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,600
to spell it out a little bit more right

787
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,279
this is good if you're going back to

788
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,200
work tomorrow and you're sort of like

789
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,320
you're you know you are a cio a cso you

790
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
know and you're thinking what tools

791
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
should i do you know should i buy you

792
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
know or what should i develop what

793
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,399
should i focus

794
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,279
my my resources on right so i think that

795
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,120
anomaly detection brings certain you

796
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
know benefits

797
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
that are going to be really critical for

798
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
cloud security and cloud native security

799
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
right um and it's not an area that

800
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,679
there's a lot of um

801
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,799
discussion about yet right there's some

802
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,159
vendors that are doing it really well i

803
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,480
saw abnormal here today

804
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,960
sentinel one is doing it as well you

805
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,559
know there's some really good companies

806
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,919
that are starting to do that and it can

807
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,440
really change the equation here for us

808
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,159
so anomaly detection i mentioned insider

809
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,960
insider threats right masquerade attacks

810
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
zero day attacks right

811
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
these are things that because i'm

812
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,559
looking at the behavior and the topology

813
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,159
of applications i'll be able to catch

814
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,679
those

815
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,120
and the thing that i think is really

816
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
interesting as well

817
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,440
is if i look at a malicious actor

818
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,720
if i have an anomaly detection

819
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
well you know a good one

820
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
in that cloud environment

821
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,440
it makes it it's quite a barrier right

822
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,320
because

823
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,600
i can you know kind of look at the cis

824
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,679
you know sort of standard i can look at

825
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,320
my stig you know hardening on my servers

826
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,760
and stuff like that

827
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
and i kind of know the landscape and i

828
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,279
kind of know that like this attack more

829
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,159
than likely will be successful right now

830
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,440
the thing is um if i don't know what i'm

831
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
expecting right because i don't know

832
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,880
what's you know what's going to be

833
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,559
detected as an anomaly in this

834
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,559
environment that i'm operating right i

835
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,399
don't know what's the typical behavior

836
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,399
and what's going to be alerted that can

837
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,799
be really powerful right the other thing

838
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,640
that anomaly detection is doing when

839
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,960
it's implemented correctly is kind of

840
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,519
move us away from that sort of you know

841
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,760
huge backlog of false positives like

842
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,840
that needle in a haystack i get so many

843
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
alerts how many are actually relevant

844
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,120
right because i'm actually alerting you

845
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,880
on things that are not part of your

846
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,640
architecture not part of your normal

847
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,279
operating behavior i'm getting less

848
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
alerts and i'm getting more objective

849
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,240
you know and actionable alerts

850
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,159
the other thing too is alert storms

851
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,880
right alert storms are a huge bane in

852
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,120
sort of like the cloud security cloud

853
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,960
native space why

854
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,360
immutable infrastructure right

855
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,919
infrastructure is code i have a lot of

856
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,559
the same i have a lot of resources that

857
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,880
are identical or at least i want to

858
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,960
right that's the whole idea you know

859
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,840
like

860
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,320
pets and cattle the whole thing right i

861
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,960
have a bunch of identical resources now

862
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,480
a flaw or a rule gets triggered i get 14

863
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,440
alerts right my jira

864
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,120
you know that happens a lot you know and

865
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,200
it can be a real distraction right and

866
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,480
it can really kind of pull the steam off

867
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,360
you know take the steam off my alerting

868
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,760
framework right so because i'm building

869
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
that logical model in cloud i know that

870
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,919
you know these 14 nodes are a cluster

871
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,080
right they are kubernetes cluster i know

872
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,960
that all of these containers are a pod

873
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,279
right that's the idea right these are

874
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,080
part of all one auto scaling group so if

875
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,840
there is something unusual about them

876
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,760
send me one alert

877
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,919
right that's the idea here so to kind of

878
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,440
move away from the alert storms

879
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,159
um so you know

880
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,480
okay andre if it's so good and it can

881
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,679
help me so much is it perfect has it

882
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,360
been challenged yes this has been

883
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,200
challenged right i was talking about how

884
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,000
much

885
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
uh dennin's

886
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,679
research has been

887
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,320
influential and survived

888
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,120
decades right still influential today

889
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,200
but there's been challenges to the model

890
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,679
from a conceptual framework right

891
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,279
conceptual um

892
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,440
viewpoint if you will

893
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
there's a famous paper you know a sort

894
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,640
of

895
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,880
very widely cited paper by gates and

896
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,720
taylor 2009

897
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,600
where

898
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,360
they challenged the anomaly detection

899
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,080
paradigm by saying

900
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,640
anomaly detection assumes that attacks

901
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,919
are anomalous or different than the norm

902
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,720
right is that always true

903
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,320
maybe maybe not right i think the

904
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,960
previous speaker um was talking about

905
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
how people you know and this is happens

906
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,279
a lot in network security where people

907
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,840
will hide the payload on the normal

908
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,480
channel like so my my server

909
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,120
is a web server that receives traffic on

910
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,440
port 80 right

911
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,840
and then the they hide their tracks

912
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,360
right they'll put like a malicious

913
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,760
packet or other types of payloads it

914
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,279
could be different things it could be

915
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,760
you know messages on the queue or or

916
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,960
like a batch

917
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,119
transfer that i'm doing right where it

918
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,199
is a normal behavior but that attack was

919
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,760
disguised because it wasn't unusual it's

920
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,399
what that system does normally right

921
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,639
so attacks are rare

922
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,480
that's not always true

923
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,440
um right you know so you know have you

924
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,040
ever opened a ssh server

925
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,000
to the dmz or put it in your house what

926
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,359
happens almost immediately

927
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,760
right logins people trying to brute

928
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,719
force your ssh server right so that

929
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,560
would be hard to detect because these

930
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,639
attacks are very common it's happening

931
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,800
all the time right and the other thing

932
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,199
is anomalous activity is malicious

933
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,760
that's the base of denning's model right

934
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,159
is that always true no

935
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,320
right it's not always true applications

936
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,800
especially now cloud native right we're

937
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,240
trying to focus on sort of the cloud

938
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
security space and cloud native

939
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,920
is this true

940
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,359
no because there's tremendous

941
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,079
experimentation right there's tremendous

942
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
you know velocity of development where

943
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,280
people are

944
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,920
using new apis they're trying to use new

945
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,160
server new services all the time and

946
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
make modifications to the services right

947
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
so there are some challenges to the

948
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,880
anomaly detection model and that's why

949
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
we want those layers right where you

950
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,839
still have the traditional

951
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,520
security um so a couple of quick

952
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,160
practice practical challenge so you know

953
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,040
i was asking myself this question right

954
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,280
so if you know anomaly detect this is so

955
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,440
cool right how come this is not how come

956
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,760
i haven't heard of this before right how

957
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,800
come

958
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,320
every tool doesn't have this right

959
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,640
because it hasn't been easy in the past

960
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,760
in the 90s and even in the 2000s right

961
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,839
because you got to

962
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,200
analyze

963
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,079
all of that data all of those things all

964
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,640
of those signals all those data points

965
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
fast enough

966
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,359
right to create a model right and and

967
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,200
that's been computationally very

968
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,040
difficult in the past right you know i

969
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,720
have a bank i have thousands and

970
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,040
thousands of servers and everybody's

971
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,880
talking to everybody right

972
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,800
okay you know like what kind of system

973
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,640
do i need to analyze that in the past it

974
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,880
was almost impossible these systems need

975
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,560
to be fast enough and they need to be

976
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,960
scalable enough for the challenge of the

977
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,680
cloud scale right you know there's you

978
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,280
know i think this um speaks for itself

979
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,440
streaming data right this is almost

980
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,920
requires an online analysis right

981
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,480
because everything you know um

982
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,119
things are moving at the speed of cloud

983
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,040
right so these things need to be fast

984
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,960
enough these models need to be fast

985
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,400
enough to do that

986
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,079
and you know that's been a problem with

987
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,000
machine learning and data science for a

988
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,520
long time right like a sort of a

989
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,160
fundamental problem that as the data set

990
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,200
grow the dimensions of that problem grow

991
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,280
and it's harder for you to find the data

992
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,480
points that are relevant within the the

993
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,839
the haystack

994
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,520
gets so much bigger it's harder to find

995
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,160
the needle right so that's been a a

996
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,839
barrier before

997
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,640
um the other thing is that

998
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,280
rich domain knowledge is needed

999
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,160
right i can build a logical model

1000
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,000
right about how am i going to know

1001
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,720
what's actually relevant so i can

1002
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,640
surface those alerts

1003
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,879
right

1004
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,560
great data scientists are a must-have

1005
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,920
but you also have to have a great

1006
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,960
security team to make sense of that data

1007
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,400
in the tool right as you're creating a

1008
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,640
platform like this right you need to

1009
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,760
have um you know a great

1010
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,079
uh world-class sort of security team

1011
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,440
that can map

1012
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,960
those data dimensions to actual security

1013
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
insights right and and that you know

1014
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,400
hasn't it's not easy right

1015
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,680
for example

1016
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,599
there's so many new apis and services

1017
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,280
all the time and their behaviors are

1018
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,240
changing all the time amazon reinvents i

1019
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,760
don't know 200

1020
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
services every year right

1021
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,200
this is all stuff that needs to be

1022
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,560
processed and kind of taken into

1023
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,880
consideration on the model

1024
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,359
um talked about development velocity

1025
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,480
right things are moving very fast

1026
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,400
auto scaling continues to be a problem

1027
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,040
this is all makes it very difficult for

1028
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,960
anomaly detection intrusion detection to

1029
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,359
be effective

1030
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,160
uh one last thing on this is disparate

1031
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,720
data sources right

1032
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,920
we have um so many sources of data we

1033
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,400
have point tools i have some tools that

1034
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,000
are scanning my code i have a different

1035
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,160
tool that's doing my pipeline i have a

1036
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,520
different tool that's doing static

1037
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,240
analysis something else for cloud i have

1038
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,560
inspector here but on azure i have this

1039
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,520
other thing right for me to gather all

1040
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
that data into the anomaly detection

1041
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,359
model is extremely difficult because

1042
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,839
there's so many silos of information

1043
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,640
right so that's been you know difficult

1044
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
in the past so what you really need is a

1045
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,839
platform

1046
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,320
right that can either concatenate and

1047
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,200
correlate all that data or sort of tool

1048
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,800
consolidation is something that's

1049
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,480
considered in this arena as well

1050
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,240
um finally you know one of the big

1051
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,480
challenges for um and i think i'm doing

1052
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,000
good on time i can slow down a little

1053
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,240
bit ten minutes maybe we'll have time

1054
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,640
for questions um

1055
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,320
so you know what about um you know

1056
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
malicious actors that are trying to

1057
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,680
attack

1058
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
your anomaly detection

1059
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,760
uh platform or you know effort right

1060
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,400
that does happen right so i was you know

1061
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,320
as i was doing this research i i found

1062
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,000
some some really good stuff where people

1063
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,839
are saying here's how you exploit

1064
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,400
anomaly detection systems right so i

1065
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,079
picked out a couple of things that i

1066
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,560
think might be relevant for the cloud

1067
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,760
framework

1068
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,359
right one of them is target recon right

1069
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,160
like casing the joint right as they say

1070
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,880
you know we talked about um insider

1071
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,079
threat

1072
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,160
right so you know and we talked about

1073
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,640
how anomaly detection can make the

1074
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,720
the ground a little unknown to a

1075
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,440
malicious actor right but potentially an

1076
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
inside

1077
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,520
um

1078
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,119
inside actor

1079
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,040
could tell you what's usual what's

1080
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,160
unusual about that environment right and

1081
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,400
then can help you kind of develop

1082
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,440
attacks and vectors that are not that

1083
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,079
out of the ordinary for that particular

1084
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,240
institutional organization

1085
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,560
right the other way that anomaly

1086
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,359
detection systems can be attacked is by

1087
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,599
generating noise you know you start to

1088
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,760
create a lot of anomalies right in

1089
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
various ways you know if you are able to

1090
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,800
do that

1091
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
then you know that system is going to

1092
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,200
generate too much too much noise

1093
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,920
and

1094
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,119
you know it's going to be harder for

1095
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,520
that analyst to really make sense

1096
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,480
of that anomaly or surface that anomaly

1097
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,760
with um

1098
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
with the correct severity right with the

1099
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,440
correct um you know urgency

1100
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,119
and we talked a little bit about covert

1101
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,359
channels where there are you know

1102
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,240
um you know malicious actors are trying

1103
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,560
to figure out ways where essentially you

1104
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,040
you know hide your tracks and kind of

1105
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,880
come in through non-anomalous ways

1106
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,440
um so you know at this point you may be

1107
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,599
losing hope right it's like okay that

1108
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,440
stuff is really promising you know it

1109
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
looks like you can help cloud security

1110
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,359
but there's all these challenges and all

1111
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,839
these difficulties you know so this is

1112
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,359
never going to be more than a niche

1113
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,280
thing in our industry right it's not

1114
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,440
really going to be the thing

1115
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,119
but i think that there's good news you

1116
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,640
know and i wanted to bring this up a

1117
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,240
little bit right one of the things

1118
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,480
that's really driving the

1119
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,319
state of the art of anomaly detection

1120
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,119
intrusion detection has been the idea of

1121
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,680
unsupervised machine learning right if

1122
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,560
you look at dennin's original model it

1123
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,960
was just statistics right i would say

1124
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,359
the typical user doesn't access more

1125
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,079
than 100 files on a given day this guy

1126
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,480
is accessing a thousand files you know

1127
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,680
models have become more more dynamic and

1128
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,400
more um you know sophisticated where you

1129
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,839
do machine learning and you don't

1130
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,480
necessarily need to set the thresholds i

1131
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
look at what joe does

1132
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,560
you know on a typical day you know i

1133
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,480
look at what that application does on a

1134
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,800
typical day a typical month and then i

1135
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
give you the model based on what i'm

1136
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,880
observing right the thing with that is

1137
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,960
that you know machine learning normally

1138
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,560
relies on

1139
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,119
essentially you tagging that data right

1140
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,800
what is normal this is normal this is

1141
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,359
normal this is not normal you know so

1142
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,880
unsupervised machine learning the

1143
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
advances in data science

1144
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,680
allow you to basically detect behavior

1145
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,760
and create those baselines without any

1146
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,240
human intervention right so from the

1147
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,560
point of view of cloud security you just

1148
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,240
provide your aws api your cloud trail

1149
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,079
you know your your you know install an

1150
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,599
agent on the servers and you collect

1151
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,400
that data and the the system will

1152
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,920
generate that model for you right faster

1153
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,680
you know so that's really you know

1154
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,839
driving you know advances on the state

1155
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,480
of the art here

1156
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,319
the other thing has been the scale and

1157
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,119
speed right so you know i mentioned that

1158
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,960
one of the challenges of anomaly

1159
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,760
detection is the speed and the scale of

1160
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
cloud

1161
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,000
but that also also works in our favor

1162
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,280
right because

1163
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,160
we can build more scalable solutions in

1164
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,880
cloud right we can build um

1165
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,720
architectures in cloud that are

1166
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,440
essentially infinitely scalable right

1167
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,520
and you know using certain techniques

1168
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,040
you know in architectures we can make

1169
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,280
the stuff really fast as well

1170
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
so you know i put a couple of questions

1171
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,400
here that we may want to ask um as as

1172
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,200
if you are evaluating vendors that have

1173
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
in their marketing brochure i do anomaly

1174
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,160
detection right how scalable is really

1175
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,880
this tool right how many resources

1176
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,880
can you analyze right some people will

1177
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,359
tell you 10 000 resources

1178
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,440
right

1179
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,400
you know

1180
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,319
you probably have more than 10 000 cloud

1181
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,720
resources in a typical organization

1182
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,960
right so make sure that as you're

1183
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,520
evaluating anomaly detection platforms

1184
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,480
that they can scale scale to the size of

1185
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,720
your environment right

1186
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
so that but but but yeah that's

1187
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,319
something that's been a positive that

1188
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,280
there are

1189
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
companies that are doing that and

1190
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,599
they're doing that very well today

1191
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,880
you know i was talking to the folks at

1192
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,520
an uh abnormal and once they built that

1193
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,160
model they're able to evaluate an email

1194
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,040
in

1195
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,160
0.7 seconds you know it's it's pretty

1196
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,079
impressive all as a software as a

1197
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,839
service

1198
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,880
um better research better data science

1199
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,280
is available today right there's been

1200
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,920
huge advances in the in the science of

1201
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,079
this right of unsupervised machine

1202
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,319
learning if you are interested in this

1203
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,560
stuff if you are someone that has um you

1204
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,680
know um that inclination you can look at

1205
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,000
stuff like isolation forest

1206
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,640
right a local outlier you know all of

1207
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
the stuff really makes the ability to

1208
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,440
detect those anomalies

1209
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,480
consuming a lot less memory and a loss a

1210
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,680
lot faster right again lending to that

1211
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,839
scale and speed that's necessary to

1212
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,560
create viable solutions here

1213
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,280
so

1214
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,280
you know the scale is better the speed

1215
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
is better the data models are better

1216
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,760
um and i think i'm closing i'm going to

1217
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,960
start closing this up so you know

1218
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,040
what's the future of anomaly detection

1219
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,359
right and how it plays into um cloud

1220
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,760
security so you know that's the good

1221
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,000
news there are better tools right so if

1222
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,920
you looked at this in the past you know

1223
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,200
like you looked at

1224
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,920
some tools like 10 years ago even five

1225
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,400
years ago even a couple of years ago i

1226
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,720
knew i tested it at our poc that it

1227
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,280
didn't really do what i needed it to do

1228
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,880
i would encourage you to kind of take a

1229
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,280
fresh look at it talk to your friendly

1230
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,400
local

1231
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,760
you know

1232
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,280
engineering head or solution architect

1233
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,280
at some of these top

1234
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,760
you know anomaly detection companies and

1235
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,520
you may be surprised it may be something

1236
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,880
that can add a lot of benefits to your

1237
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,040
cloud security portfolio

1238
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,720
so the second thing that i'm i'm really

1239
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
looking forward to that you know i hope

1240
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,880
is going to be the evolution of anomaly

1241
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,839
detection platforms is the idea of

1242
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,280
combining

1243
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,079
signature base with anomaly detection in

1244
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,800
the same platform right that can be

1245
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,880
really really powerful so you are taking

1246
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,200
you are doing compliance you are doing

1247
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,520
vulnerability management but you also

1248
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,319
doing anomaly detection right into one

1249
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,359
cohesive better tool right we i hope

1250
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,680
we're going to see more of that whether

1251
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,560
you know but if if done correctly right

1252
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,119
the talked about the better data models

1253
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,880
get into that it's definitely worth

1254
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,560
taking a look at it and i think you you

1255
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560
know just for your own knowledge

1256
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
understand how some of these things are

1257
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,040
are being created it's something that

1258
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,960
it's very very impressive

1259
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,640
the other thing that's very very

1260
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,720
important is it that it's not done

1261
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,520
super well yet from the research that i

1262
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,359
did is correlation

1263
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,440
of the signature based with the anomaly

1264
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,760
detection that can be really really

1265
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,119
powerful right

1266
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,040
so for example i can say

1267
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,680
i have these vulnerabilities this system

1268
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,000
is only partially compliance with our

1269
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,559
hardening standard and i'm observing

1270
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,760
this behavior right into one signal and

1271
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,040
one alert

1272
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,200
right that can be really really powerful

1273
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
that can really um

1274
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,839
reduce those false positives bring other

1275
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,920
things that will be difficult to to

1276
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,839
arise the other thing too that's

1277
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,440
important that a lot of the models are

1278
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,880
not doing yet

1279
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,680
from my research is correlating multiple

1280
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,520
events right i think a lot of the

1281
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,839
platforms that i you know research

1282
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,240
preparing for this there will be they'll

1283
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,040
be able to tell you one anomaly right

1284
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,319
this individual anomalous action right

1285
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,160
um you know but not necessarily to say

1286
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,760
there's a bunch of things that are

1287
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,240
mildly suspicious but then putting all

1288
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,680
of those together

1289
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,960
here is something that deserves

1290
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
investigation right that's something

1291
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,119
that needs more work and that's the last

1292
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,559
thing i'm going to say is that um r d is

1293
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,440
needed right this is not necessarily no

1294
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,200
we need to continue to evolve these

1295
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,680
platforms but it costs a lot of money

1296
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,280
because as i mentioned you need a

1297
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,680
world-class data science team and you

1298
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,559
need

1299
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,800
a world-class security team you need

1300
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,160
people that know how to scale these

1301
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,960
services in various clouds right this is

1302
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,960
all expensive you know so what's been

1303
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,319
happening in our industry that's been

1304
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,440
great is all the startup innovation and

1305
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,960
the vc cache right that's you know some

1306
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,200
folks have been able to get huge piles

1307
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,480
of cash to build that rnd right

1308
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,800
current economic conditions you know may

1309
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,960
or may not change this in the future

1310
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,640
right so i would welcome and love to see

1311
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,880
more r d happening in there and i hope

1312
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,079
that that continues to take place into

1313
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,000
our industry the last thing that i'm

1314
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,480
going to say is get into the groove

1315
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,480
quote unquote right this is worth your

1316
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,400
time to investigate is worth taking a

1317
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,319
look at that try to bring this into your

1318
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,240
security portfolio i think that we're

1319
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,680
all going to be better off for that

1320
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,520
thank you any questions if we have time

1321
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,599
50 seconds

1322
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,960
that's it

1323
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,480
thank you rva

1324
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,409
[Applause]
