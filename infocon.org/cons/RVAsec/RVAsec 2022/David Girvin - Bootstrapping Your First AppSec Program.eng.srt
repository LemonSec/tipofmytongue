1
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,140
all right how's everybody doing

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,640
we gotta

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,960
stay awake after lunch

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,859
so guys I'm going to talk to you today

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,900
about apps deck we're going to talk

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,160
about actually building an appsec

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,539
program

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,679
um we're going to walk through a bunch

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,059
of different stages some technical stuff

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,040
and things like that but we're also

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,719
going to talk about the psychology

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
behind it we're going to talk about the

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,719
relationships you have to the company

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,520
and the things that everybody forgets

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,660
about

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,700
um but let's jump in

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,520
okay who am I uh my name is David girvin

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,340
I have a big dumb mustache and I'm a big

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,920
weirdo I'm a husband father Surfer

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,020
hydrofoil I love Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,219
travel

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,539
um

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,760
yeah I

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
I have a real weird background there's

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,780
just a few things I'm a ship captain and

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,600
a pilot I had a fabrication engineering

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,939
company and I was a missionary in Africa

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,340
and Southeast Asia

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,500
so basically that's there just to show

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,140
you that I am not the normal got my

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,760
masters in cyber security went to cyber

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,500
security

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,759
and that gave me a very different

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,979
perspective on things that's my lovely

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,900
family they're way better than I am at

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,259
everything being a human and some of the

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,060
places I worked were one password we

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,280
hacked purple uh bit Discovery and

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,360
currently I'm at Red Canary

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,520
okay we're going to outline building

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,259
your abstract program with a different

42
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,579
perspective on management and

43
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,140
integration

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,119
um some of the things that will hit are

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
social engineering for good I know

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,659
everybody's been to Defcon they don't

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,920
understand that statement like social

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,720
engineering that's what we do to be bad

49
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,600
but there's a good way to do it appsec

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,100
is internal sales

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,899
be a part of the team

52
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,320
technical sdlc dive and what has and

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
hasn't worked for me I've failed a lot

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,979
and from those failures I figured out

55
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,020
how to do some things right which is

56
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,840
amazing that I could do that but

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
um warning Concepts thoughts they're all

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,000
based on anecdotal evidence from

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,620
building application Security Programs

60
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,379
they're my personal opinions so if you

61
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,360
do disagree that's fine if you need to

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,060
complain there's my email I used to have

63
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,680
one that was more vulgar but this is

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,720
family friendly uh if you find me

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,060
abrasive and sarcastic you know but

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,459
somewhat Charming you're not wrong I am

67
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,099
but uh one thing I do do well is I care

68
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,620
about people well I just am a broken

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,440
human so I come off like a jerk but uh

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,879
that's part of appsec right we're

71
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,560
offensive security guys that you don't

72
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,239
want anybody actually talking in public

73
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,819
that's in offensive security and if you

74
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,440
hang toilet paper over the back of the

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,580
Roll

76
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,800
get out of my talk

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,780
I don't like you there's something

78
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,400
broken with you and if I'm saying that

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,220
you're really broken so there we go uh

80
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,019
syllabus these are the things we're

81
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,540
going to hit what's an absec program why

82
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,660
spend money here how to hire

83
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,040
relationship you know threat modeling

84
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
stlc blah blah blah I'm just putting

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,519
this in there to show you

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,739
if you're management and you've been at

87
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,140
technical talks falling asleep uh I'm

88
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
gonna have something for you if you're

89
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,739
Technical and your your boots to the

90
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:20,760
ground you're doing stuff I'll have

91
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,260
something for you I'm trying to make

92
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,440
this fit the conference uh so you can

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,239
sleep for part of it whichever one you

94
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,239
don't want to but I will wake you up

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,980
um so what is appsec

96
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,959
um application security or we call it

97
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,459
product security at my company yes

98
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,560
people argue there's a difference I

99
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,260
don't care uh but it's it's a team it's

100
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,000
a program designed to protect the code

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,560
that you own

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,739
um it is uh includes all the code your

103
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,739
engineers write uh third-party libraries

104
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,739
open source tools you use all that stuff

105
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,319
is vulnerable it's a strong relationship

106
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,000
between you and C Level

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,120
and any stakeholders in your company

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,159
it's internal sales and this is one like

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,860
all the super nerds like what sales guy

110
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,260
are the devil and I'm like I'll I'll get

111
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,000
there but you know you have to learn to

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,799
be sales and appsec

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,019
um it's a smart use of tools and testing

114
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,239
uh it's also understanding that business

115
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,399
doesn't flow there's no product if we

116
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,220
Jam everybody up we don't make money you

117
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,740
don't have a job I mean these are hard

118
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,000
Concepts

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
um but it's not old school grumpy

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,600
gatekeeping they're like pushing the

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,699
glasses actually guy you know I have him

122
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,500
in one of my memes

123
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,940
um it's definitely not dumping a

124
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,080
thousand vulnerabilities on your

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,699
engineering team and being like fix it

126
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,100
you guys wrote crappy code

127
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,600
um that does not work I can hear the

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,340
laughs like the and that's actually not

129
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,919
laugh that's a cry it's like heartbreak

130
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,120
inside

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,139
um

132
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,880
uh yelling when something can't get

133
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
fixed right away you know

134
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,740
you I am that person I'm an angry person

135
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,240
but we have to learn how to control

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
ourselves and uh building a wall you

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,259
don't want to start a war with

138
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,320
engineering those dudes have been angry

139
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,600
for a long time so you know

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,560
um

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
but you know for the CTO or CFO or

142
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,759
whatever you know why spend money in

143
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,860
here uh here's just a few things in 2020

144
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,800
average cost to businesses affected to

145
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,780
data breach the United States 8.6

146
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,240
million that's an average

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
sucks if you're on the top end of that

148
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,440
you know uh reputational damage in my

149
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
opinion is far worse when I threat model

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,039
companies I do the business side of

151
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,960
things too I enjoy SWAT and like looking

152
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,139
at product development planning uh I

153
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,419
talk to them extensively like this all

154
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,039
these small Niche companies like who I

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
work for uh when I work for one password

156
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,259
you don't use them necessarily

157
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,240
because you like them even though you

158
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,740
should you use them because you trust

159
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,600
the name everybody here's like I use one

160
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
password it's my password manager it

161
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
works I know them they're good

162
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,580
um so you know same with where we're at

163
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,639
now so uh reputational damage is such a

164
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,080
big thing we have to be so careful with

165
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,880
that and making sure that we protect our

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,139
company

167
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,720
that employs us

168
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,100
um

169
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,080
you want to protect your customers this

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,880
is a huge thing I think sometimes in

171
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,380
Tech we forget that we have customers

172
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,120
and their people and they do good things

173
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
and they have their own businesses and

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,139
you know and when it comes to appsec we

175
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,820
want to detect our internal customers

176
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,940
which is our company so

177
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,460
it's uh also estimated that we lose 250

178
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,979
to 60 billion dollars of intellectual

179
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,740
property being stolen is just I can't

180
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,720
even understand that like it's insane to

181
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,240
think how many good ideas of ours get

182
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,759
stolen by other countries and hackers

183
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,340
and nation states all the fun stuff

184
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,560
um hopefully your insurance mandates it

185
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,400
I know Jake's laughing somewhere uh but

186
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,419
uh you know it's one of those things

187
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,520
that we need uh every single company

188
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,919
that has code should have application

189
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,039
security this isn't 2004 and you're a

190
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,659
damn adult so learn it

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,479
okay we're gonna start with hiring

192
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:58,319
um

193
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
I love Zoolander memes so there's going

194
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
to be too many memes I apologize already

195
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,220
but um you know soft skills are more

196
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,440
important than being a schmee

197
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,240
to all the schmeeze in the room you're

198
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,380
important

199
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,960
I'll give you a hug after the conference

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,479
come find me I have the green lanyard we

201
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,680
can hug

202
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,979
um but it's it's true if you get the

203
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,479
smartest dude on your team but he's a

204
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,940
dick nothing happens so if you hire a

205
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,740
jerk nothing will get done

206
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,319
your first hire should be a 50 50 mix of

207
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,060
amazing soft skills and application

208
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,039
security not saying they should be a

209
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,800
dummy I'm saying that they need to

210
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
understand how to talk to people and no

211
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,259
application security so higher levels of

212
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,819
understanding of application security is

213
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,300
okay if someone can go okay

214
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,360
giving them tokens is bad

215
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,560
hopefully they have a little bit better

216
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,840
understanding of certain protocols and

217
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,160
stuff like that but

218
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,380
if they get the ideas if you can ask

219
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,060
them like how does this work and they

220
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,440
can tell you but they can't write the

221
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,539
code guess what that's okay

222
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,099
because when you get into real

223
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,539
engineering and you have really

224
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,639
complicated code bases you're not going

225
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,960
to be able to keep up with the engineers

226
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,280
unless you're in that code base every

227
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,360
day

228
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,199
so it's okay to hire newer people who

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,460
understand the basics and have amazing

230
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,900
soft skills

231
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,240
um I have neither and they hired me and

232
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,240
now I talk in front of people so

233
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,280
um you know while it's nice they don't

234
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,500
need 10 years of Dev experience you do

235
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,060
want when you start building a team out

236
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,979
you're not just one guy you do you do

237
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,680
need good Dev experience you know on my

238
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,659
team I have a mix of Breakers and devs

239
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,299
and and you know I'm make sure that

240
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,679
we're all learning each other's skills

241
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,659
you know I can write code it's pretty

242
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,000
bad code but I make sure that I team up

243
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
with uh one of my awesome devs who's on

244
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,620
my security team and we we code pair

245
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,120
together you know we I make sure that

246
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm improving and I teach him how to

247
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,920
think like a jerk so it's it really

248
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,000
works

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,339
um you can't find that unicorn and you

250
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,140
definitely can't find that unicorn for

251
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,519
subpar pay

252
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,980
so you have to be realistic in how much

253
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,500
money you can pay people I hear guys all

254
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,120
the time like why can't I find a guy

255
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,700
with 15 years death experience 15 years

256
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,500
of breaking experience has run a

257
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
security team and I want to pay him

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,040
seventy thousand dollars a year

259
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,320
I don't know dummy like why can't you

260
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,540
find that guy it's math you know

261
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,399
um you can't afford that guy that's just

262
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,140
realistic and you have to find other

263
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,180
ways around that problem it's okay I've

264
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,399
done it before and you can too

265
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,959
um you got to balance your team with

266
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,339
people who have experience in particular

267
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,260
skill sets but are still jack of all

268
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,420
trades uh this is something I really

269
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,300
just smash about all day on my team

270
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,920
which is we need to learn how to do

271
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,240
everything

272
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,940
application security is so big and so

273
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,700
broad that takes 25 years so what do you

274
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,180
do you're humble and you ask questions

275
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,040
and then when someone on your team is

276
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,300
awesome at something like you just have

277
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,580
some just amazing breaker every time

278
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,540
you're doing an internal print test

279
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,980
every time you turn on Burp Suite guess

280
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,080
what we jump on with him for an hour and

281
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,940
he shows us tips and tricks you know if

282
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,320
you have someone who's just an awesome

283
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,019
scripter and he can hook every API up

284
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,880
like it's nothing you know we jump on

285
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,440
with him and we look at like oh my

286
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,180
python sucks compared to yours why is

287
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,160
this you know so these are the things

288
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,500
that you have to do because this is not

289
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,720
something you can just pay your way into

290
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,500
it's massive massive undertaking

291
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,420
um good bridge building can make up for

292
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,860
Less technical skill

293
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,320
but amazing technical skill cannot make

294
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,420
up for a Bridge Burner

295
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,120
this is huge and I'm not

296
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,440
anti-hypertechnical apsec people like

297
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,420
some of the guys on my team and I work

298
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,800
with some amazing people like Matt

299
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,080
Graber like just Monsters of reverse

300
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,760
engineering and stuff they're some of

301
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,140
the best in the world but they're nice

302
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,880
and they're nice to other people in the

303
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,220
company so

304
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,959
can you tell that I came in when

305
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,640
security was a little grumpier than it

306
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,939
is now

307
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,560
um appsec has insane salaries if you

308
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,839
can't afford take a take a chance with a

309
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,700
passionate new person uh we talked about

310
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,399
that a little bit already but uh funny

311
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,140
sarcastic people can be great bridge

312
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,600
builders

313
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,120
um we work primarily with engineers and

314
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,320
it's a different audience than

315
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,839
traditional infosec a lot of traditional

316
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
infosec is more

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,500
dealing with network you're not dealing

318
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,420
with Engineers or your GRC you're

319
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,040
dealing with Auditors it's very like

320
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,220
Thai and and that kind of thing apps

321
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,260
that's different Engineers are special

322
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,100
people and from what I've seen they're

323
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,480
all different

324
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,940
but they take sarcasm very well

325
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,980
um and it's a it's a great group of

326
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,420
where you can take someone who might be

327
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,640
annoying to the GRC team and you can put

328
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,380
them in the appsec team and they make

329
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,459
people laugh because they're stuck

330
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,200
behind a computer coding all day you

331
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,560
know it's it's a different reality and

332
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,880
um

333
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
and we're the best we're the most fun at

334
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,260
the bar I mean let's just be it's just

335
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,760
how it is I don't know why that is but

336
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,320
appsec when you take people out to

337
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,300
dinner we're better than sales people

338
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,800
we don't pick up the tab though that's

339
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,699
why you bring the sales people

340
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,079
um opposing view higher Rockstar

341
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,120
Rockstar security developers to fix all

342
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,100
the bad code so I have friends in this

343
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,260
industry that are very good at what they

344
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,779
do they think what I say is wrong

345
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,240
because they are amazing developers and

346
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,040
they're like I got hired as a security

347
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,420
deaf and I just go in there and fix

348
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,220
everything

349
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,339
that works when you have 100 people

350
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,160
how many here have 5 000 developers in

351
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,260
their company or 10 000 developers in

352
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,720
the country company can anybody jump in

353
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,180
and fix that code base no you might be

354
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,339
able to patch a few things

355
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,260
um so

356
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,260
that kind of security I think worked

357
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,720
really good 15 years ago

358
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,459
I think it's changing though

359
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,380
we have so many more people in the

360
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,579
industry we have so many important

361
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,220
people writing code uh I don't think

362
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,860
there can be a schmee to fix every

363
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,560
single uh vulnerability I just I don't

364
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,620
see how it can scale on a good level

365
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,980
um so you know obviously the baby says

366
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,420
that's just wrong

367
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,940
I just had like my second kid and for

368
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,500
some reason baby memes are funny to me

369
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,200
now and and I apologize for being a dad

370
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,500
and old so it's just working that way

371
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,320
um but you know

372
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,200
what gets us some more uh the technical

373
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,639
side of things here in a second but

374
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,800
we're kind of going through just this

375
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,899
whole thought process on on management

376
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,959
and and how that's all working

377
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
um so I teach leadership stuff outside

378
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,959
of work uh real passionate about this I

379
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,180
feel like good leaders raise up people

380
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,040
around them and it changes people's

381
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
lives so

382
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,519
if you build an application team

383
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,279
you're going to be a team leader right

384
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,800
um even right now like I have a

385
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,060
leadership role in our team and I'm not

386
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,019
the director

387
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,760
but it's more of a cultural leadership

388
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,120
role I make sure people are doing well

389
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,860
so just a couple of thoughts on on

390
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,120
leading your team

391
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,880
uh it's really easy for your team to

392
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,579
fail from Bad leadership because you

393
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,339
know runs downhill so a good

394
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,779
security person isn't necessarily a good

395
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,579
team leader if your team leader doesn't

396
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,839
generally care about the individual

397
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,959
success as well as the teams you get

398
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,720
shitty middle management uh I see so

399
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,579
many heads nodding right now so you guys

400
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,560
have been there uh when you have the guy

401
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,540
above you who isn't really that good at

402
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,240
his job and he's a jerk uh that makes it

403
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,160
a lot worse you can put up with someone

404
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,600
who's just a monster and they're so good

405
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,459
you're like yeah he's just a little bit

406
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,600
there

407
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,920
um or you can put up with someone who

408
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,079
cares about you you know but when you

409
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,540
get them both and you gotta like take a

410
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,680
step back when you're building these

411
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,540
teams and look at like yourself and

412
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,040
really ask like should I be leading this

413
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,620
team what are my blind spots like this

414
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,860
is hard like humanistic things to do but

415
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,459
um

416
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,459
a few quick things I'm a big proponent

417
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,740
of servant-minded leadership uh customer

418
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,399
focused which is your team uh you know

419
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,139
you're focused on your team members

420
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,579
success

421
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,199
you know if you focus on your team

422
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,360
member success your team is going to

423
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,240
Excel all the other stuff your metrics

424
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,680
hitting your kpis all that kind of stuff

425
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,820
is going to hit

426
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,199
because you're making sure that

427
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,760
everybody on your team is crushing it

428
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,920
they have good mental health they have

429
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,720
the right work you're not putting them

430
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,940
in positions that are too easy or too

431
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,380
hard for them like these are all things

432
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,180
that really matter

433
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,800
um and you know the whole servant mining

434
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
leadership thing is leading from the

435
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,920
front you're out there

436
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,959
working just as hard you're a shield

437
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,899
you're not going well Bob just didn't

438
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,880
pull his weight this this uh Sprint

439
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,860
sorry you know like you don't do that

440
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,800
and that just ruins all this because

441
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,899
this team is a really weird team you

442
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,820
have to be technical but you really have

443
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,839
to

444
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,180
be able to push through all the soft

445
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,540
skill side of stuff and and actually

446
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,560
build all these relationships and

447
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,500
bridges which we'll talk about

448
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,600
uh humility and honesty make up for not

449
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,779
knowing everything if you cannot be in a

450
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,519
meeting with developers and they talk

451
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,779
about something you don't know and go

452
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,760
hey whoa I have no idea what you're

453
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,079
talking about

454
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,699
that's a pride thing and you shouldn't

455
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,220
be an appsec you should straight up get

456
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,920
out because there no one in this

457
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,959
industry in application security knows

458
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,820
all that like I don't care who you are

459
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,980
you just don't so you have to be have

460
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,660
humility you have to be honest you have

461
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,399
to like ask questions and be good at

462
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,459
asking questions that's a huge skill set

463
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,959
um you know

464
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,360
honest visibility uh be open when you're

465
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,699
crushing it and when you need help it's

466
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:27,959
not just being honest and humble it's

467
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,940
also having real visibility you know you

468
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,100
need to make sure upper management your

469
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,300
team knows everything that's actually

470
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,920
going on you're not hiding things all

471
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,300
that kind of stuff it's weird I've

472
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,220
worked around a lot of weird people

473
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,920
um but those things really matter uh

474
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,440
taking responsibility for failures uh

475
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,480
own up right off the bat like I've been

476
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,279
in so many Dev meetings where I did

477
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,600
something stupid

478
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,880
and I'm just like I screwed up I'm

479
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
buying everybody here beer and nachos or

480
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,459
whatever we want I apologize

481
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,320
um but I'll be here with you to fix it

482
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,279
you know

483
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,259
that shows those people that you're in

484
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,060
it with them it really does make a

485
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,260
difference when you're just grinding

486
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,579
through all this code

487
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,079
and uh

488
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,599
yes this is my favorite one learn to

489
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,760
care about other people

490
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,699
have you met other people

491
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,339
do any of you drive we already talked

492
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,959
about that earlier

493
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
I hate every human on this planet when

494
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,220
I'm in my car

495
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,140
is isn't something that comes naturally

496
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,819
I'm not like I don't wake up and go I

497
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,700
love people I have to like talk myself

498
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,380
up I have to be like okay this is your

499
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,299
job your job is to go in there make sure

500
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,059
these dudes succeed crush this and care

501
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,980
about them on personal levels

502
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,380
you know uh obviously I don't work in

503
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,120
corporate infosec you know because I

504
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,320
actually like have all my friends

505
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,179
numbers at work and stuff like that but

506
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,840
I want these people to win and um I

507
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,520
think that's what leadership is you know

508
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,320
you're invested in their personal lives

509
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
so it's hard it's real hard because as

510
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,179
we said we've all driven a car before

511
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,179
and people suck so it's uh it's

512
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,919
something we have to continuously keep

513
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,160
pushing for

514
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,780
I told you he was in here I love this

515
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,120
meme I don't know uh what's our

516
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,160
relationship with the company

517
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,960
um I think this is kind of a different

518
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,400
view than you're going to hear in a lot

519
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,020
of abstic talks

520
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,700
um I don't think that security should be

521
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,340
the nerds in the closet uh and and I've

522
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,260
proven it at my company now

523
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,200
um we're loved by our company we are we

524
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,240
bring value and revenue to the company

525
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,299
uh which is rare to hear uh for appsec

526
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,820
but uh every company would be different

527
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,440
and this is how I try to place us we

528
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,940
view all of our positions as internal

529
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,580
sales and customer service I don't know

530
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,620
if you guys have ever been around a real

531
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,919
modern I.T program but they position

532
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,280
themselves as sales or customer service

533
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,980
to the internal company you know they

534
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,200
treat all the internal employees getting

535
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,780
their jamf updated or their new Macbook

536
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,480
or whatever as customers so they treat

537
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,919
them like humans and they're nice to

538
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,240
them unless you work at a crappy company

539
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
we don't treat them like those customers

540
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,080
dream like good customers

541
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,820
um and that's what we try to do too I

542
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,860
look at engineering as a customer base

543
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,380
as valued people that if I don't have

544
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,720
them I don't have a job just like in

545
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,919
sales if you don't have customers

546
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,960
there's no money so we don't work and

547
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,100
then we all have to go back to getting

548
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,179
real jobs where we have to use our hands

549
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,020
um

550
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,480
but we also have a unique place we touch

551
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,660
the sea level we talk product managers

552
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,460
Engineers managers I.T sales GRC

553
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,799
absec done correctly is really

554
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,940
interesting because you actually

555
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,340
influence all these things

556
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,740
um is anybody here like

557
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,860
you know ever done us a offensive view

558
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,360
of product

559
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,700
like I've done that multiple times uh

560
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,580
you know like the salesy term is SWAT

561
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,740
um but I look at as red teaming our

562
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,299
product so I'm not talking about the

563
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,500
code base I'm talking about where we

564
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,320
stand in a business you know who's our

565
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,500
competition uh you know

566
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,179
are we going to be

567
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,620
ousted by this technology what do we

568
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,539
have to look forward to I mean this is

569
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,400
from being an abstract minor person you

570
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,900
think like a criminal that's why you're

571
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,240
an appsec and somehow we're not in jail

572
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,100
and people pay us money to be criminals

573
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,559
it's a it's an impressive thing but we

574
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,360
actually can add value to everybody we

575
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,220
can show the c-suite how much money they

576
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,360
can save and how much money they can

577
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,039
spend these are all different things

578
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,360
that you have to think of it we're not

579
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,919
just going to go run tools that's not

580
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,559
appsec this is appsec

581
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,460
um

582
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,220
yeah and like I said I want my team to

583
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,780
be loved by the company

584
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,620
um

585
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,500
it you'll see why more this isn't like

586
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,299
the weird ego thing

587
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,760
um I know I'm an idiot I don't need the

588
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,140
company to love me for that my wife

589
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,260
loves me and that's all I need and she

590
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,480
really bad taste but

591
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,900
um it's it's a it's a thing when you're

592
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,400
loved by the company you can get things

593
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,299
done

594
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,480
and we ask for the worst things when

595
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,880
something really bad and we go we have

596
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,940
to stop prod and fix this

597
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,840
if it's Chad in the basement going hey

598
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,000
you you didn't do this right

599
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,440
and you can't code anything now we have

600
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,059
to stop production you're not going to

601
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,340
do it right but if it's your buddy that

602
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,380
took you to beers and likes you and like

603
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,120
sent you some cool lock pickings crap

604
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,919
and all this weird nerdy stuff you're

605
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,039
like oh Dave doesn't suck that much I'm

606
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,480
gonna do this for him

607
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,419
it's really about winning people and

608
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,340
getting things done in the company and

609
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,960
and that's you know that's how abstract

610
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,240
has to happen because everybody here

611
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,400
that has worked in appsec has as an

612
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,720
engineer dig his heels on the ground

613
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,580
until you know

614
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,960
it's tough but there's ways to get

615
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,520
around that

616
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,860
so where do we start before anything I

617
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,940
already talked about hiring all that

618
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,840
kind of stuff but where do we start with

619
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,220
our program

620
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,720
um threat modeling

621
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,299
um I heard there were some feds here

622
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,280
welcome

623
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,419
Maybe

624
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,159
if one of you is my Handler I hope you

625
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,380
got my cookies at Christmas

626
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,520
um but yeah

627
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,200
let's threat model it's just what I was

628
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,280
talking about I threat model everything

629
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,140
I threat model business I threat model

630
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,960
my house I threat model appsec this is

631
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,039
this is awesome

632
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,740
uh the normal appsec path is git tool

633
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,780
run tools send 5000 volts to engineering

634
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,460
 about them being dumb and not

635
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,919
doing it and has that worked for anybody

636
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,960
I have not seen that work in a company

637
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,280
yet

638
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,380
um I've seen guys making like 200 000 a

639
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,760
year doing that and not getting anything

640
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,620
done that doesn't make any sense to me

641
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,539
in my head

642
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,780
but uh threat modding should help you uh

643
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,940
find real areas of concern uh

644
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,340
exploitable vulnerabilities from right

645
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,500
off the bat you know I've definitely had

646
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,700
threat models where I'm sitting there

647
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,380
and I'm like oh we have everything's

648
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,940
done kubernetes and Docker okay cool

649
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,640
what are we using for our Docker images

650
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,880
oh cool uh

651
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,740
huh did you write all those Docker

652
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,140
images and root

653
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
yeah

654
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,380
yeah we're gonna have to change every

655
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,059
single one of our documents now you know

656
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,039
that's a real exploitable vulnerability

657
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,120
that you can just find through threat

658
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,299
modeling and um

659
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,919
you need to build out your procedure

660
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,539
first you need to really understand

661
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,580
threat modeling read some books and then

662
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,980
write it all out and build a policy for

663
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,020
it so anybody can do it don't be a

664
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,179
gatekeeper you build something that

665
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,659
every single person can do

666
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,740
and then you don't have to do things

667
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,720
alone so threat modeling should be

668
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,520
sitting down with that engineering team

669
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,919
with Engineers or even with sales

670
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,400
Engineers I've had Kaizen marketing find

671
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,020
vulnerabilities through threat modeling

672
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,780
programs because they want to sit in one

673
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,799
so you need to build something that

674
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,260
everybody can attain to and jump in with

675
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,840
you and this is building awesome Bridges

676
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,740
um

677
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,260
when you have an engineer in here and

678
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,400
you're talking over something and

679
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,960
looking at an information path or where

680
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,700
you're sharing data or whatever and that

681
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,780
entry goes you know what

682
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,460
this direction we'd be able to exploit

683
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,440
that and he's never thought like that

684
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,760
before hey guess what you have a new

685
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,600
friend

686
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,400
he's going to be stoked he found some

687
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,740
cool weird hack you can even like

688
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,820
exploit it you know with him or her

689
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,320
and do it through that way and then

690
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,820
they're they're stoked now you have

691
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,299
someone on your team forever but

692
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,159
all this stuff

693
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,679
actually gets you ready to start doing a

694
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,840
security sdlc all this stuff gets you

695
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,220
ready to build your program because if

696
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,659
you know where your real weak points are

697
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,400
guess what that's where you start and

698
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,140
that's the hardest point but you got to

699
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,240
make it fun I put you know beer food

700
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,039
give them black hoodies tell them

701
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,960
they're hackers you're a hacker today

702
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,059
they're like oh cool I got to go I feel

703
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,220
like this I don't act like that um I

704
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,559
usually wear purple pink but that's just

705
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,120
because I'm weird

706
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,820
um so the secure software development

707
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,720
life cycle our secure sdlc

708
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,980
this is

709
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,020
what most people think of app set

710
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,200
this is uh how we're going to secure our

711
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,900
our entire code base and the whole life

712
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,000
cycle for development and continuous

713
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,440
Improvement

714
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,580
um

715
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,460
but again this is where people get too

716
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,200
excited this is where people just start

717
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,760
running tools and sending phones and

718
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,620
jumping in and they hear the sales guy

719
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,360
the sales guy told me shift left awesome

720
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,640
you know like uh so you're going to

721
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,860
threat model first before you do any of

722
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,960
this because you can't secure what you

723
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,980
don't understand if you don't know what

724
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,419
your attack surfaces how are you going

725
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,760
to secure it right you're not if you've

726
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,500
done an audit have you done any of the

727
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,779
the footwork stuff first if you don't

728
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,179
there's nowhere to go

729
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,080
um

730
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
and uh pushing left isn't always the

731
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,799
right place to start I'll go over that

732
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,720
sorry there's a couple apps like peoples

733
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,700
here their head is exploding that I just

734
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,559
said that but you won't be mad in a

735
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,299
minute

736
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,640
um you need relationships to build and

737
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,260
Implement these controls

738
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,299
if not you will get ignored I'm gonna

739
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,700
I'm gonna say that one one more time you

740
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,860
need relationships

741
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,500
built to implement these controls if not

742
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,059
you will get ignored

743
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,020
uh if you go and run a SAS tool on your

744
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,260
code base and you get 30 000

745
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,940
vulnerabilities and then you go drop

746
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,720
that in jira you might get shot

747
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,179
you know like if you want to piss off an

748
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,940
entire fleet of Engineers go do that and

749
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,039
I have had multiple guys come up to me

750
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,480
they're like dude I tried to start

751
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,760
appsec and and I heard you and I heard

752
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,039
Tanya and I tried to do it and they all

753
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,039
hate me now that's why don't do that we

754
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,659
don't start there uh you're gonna start

755
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,159
with one control

756
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,539
and you're going to plan out your next

757
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,740
year

758
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,900
the whole year you're gonna everything

759
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,860
you're gonna do with that control for

760
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,760
that year

761
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,799
you can do other controls but that's I

762
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,900
need that planned out first I have the

763
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,159
next two and a half years planned out

764
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,520
for my controls right now on my team

765
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,320
um that that includes maturing but

766
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,419
they're out

767
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,580
um you have to be flexible some things

768
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,140
don't work in your work culture don't

769
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,580
listen to every talking head like me

770
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,039
like I'm an idiot like if I say

771
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,360
something you're like well dude so this

772
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,500
but I don't think it'll work in my

773
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,940
company guess what it won't work in your

774
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,919
company like I'm never right

775
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,039
um just sometimes uh and uh after

776
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,419
implementing control

777
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,460
step back build a plan for the

778
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,720
continuous Improvement for that control

779
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,120
or already have in place don't just jump

780
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,559
into the next one

781
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,200
if a control is a blocking control like

782
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,220
it's something that's going to stop the

783
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,460
CI CD or whatever and and stop builds

784
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,919
really be careful with it I always start

785
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,620
it as an education thing where just like

786
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,500
bring something up you know in uh Visual

787
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,059
Studio or whatever and it's like that

788
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,279
was stupid

789
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,080
and then it becomes a suggestion and

790
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,299
then I write policy for it and I slowly

791
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,520
slowly move it after multiple lunch and

792
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,900
learns and stuff like that into a

793
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,640
mandatory blocking control because

794
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,179
blocking controls make people very angry

795
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,220
and you need to have buy-in and policy

796
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,419
to back up those things before you do

797
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,580
any sort of stuff like that

798
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,299
um

799
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,279
but

800
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,620
these are kind of like the basic steps

801
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,840
for looking at this uh it's it's not a

802
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,299
short process the security Guy TV he was

803
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,320
asking me he's like why don't we just

804
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,360
patch everything and start our apps that

805
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,460
program what's it take like two months I

806
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,600
was like

807
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,080
like my first control for this company I

808
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,320
I had to sit through I don't know 20

809
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,940
sales

810
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,380
lies and uh our demos and and then I had

811
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,000
to look at how I'm going to implement

812
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,400
this how I'm going to fix all this how

813
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,380
I'm going to tune the machine or the

814
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,600
tool before I can even implement it like

815
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,419
I mean it takes months to do this and

816
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,799
they're like we want it now well you can

817
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,880
have it now but it's going to suck it's

818
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,799
not going to work if you do it this way

819
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,179
you're going to introduce something

820
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,039
slowly and surely and you won't make

821
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,900
everybody as mad

822
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,640
um and so that's just where I got with

823
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,840
this kind of stuff

824
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,380
for each control uh you know we learn

825
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,600
what problem we're going to solve I

826
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,100
write these out I know it sounds kind of

827
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,360
silly but you know

828
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,679
I dropped out of school in third grade

829
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,799
so uh not really but what technology we

830
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,539
use what part of the company we need to

831
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,760
understand we enumerate it just like

832
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,260
you're doing a penetration test you need

833
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,520
to enumerate these things you need to

834
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,539
write them all out you need to figure

835
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,760
out all your paths we're going to plan

836
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,520
it out we get all the people involved

837
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,900
we put together a good plan of action

838
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,880
including metrics and stakeholders and

839
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,679
everything

840
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,059
and you need to have that in the

841
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,260
beginning how are you going to show

842
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,279
worth how you're going to do all this

843
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:17,760
kind of stuff uh design look at how

844
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,899
important this control is in your

845
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,460
company it's going to be a holistic

846
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,080
approach I hate that word but I can't

847
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,179
really think of anything else so it's in

848
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,799
the slides a few times but I sound so

849
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,100
corny wait a single pane of glass

850
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,679
Quantum come on give me another puzzle

851
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,559
Synergy okay now we're good do I do I

852
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,059
feel like a CEO now

853
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,940
I feel like going okay and then you need

854
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,779
approval and buy-in uh this is huge

855
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,820
if you don't have real buy-in like if

856
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,640
your VP of engineering does not buy into

857
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,500
the control you're about to put in is

858
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,779
not going to happen just trash it

859
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,659
step on it light on fire it's dead it

860
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,980
will never happen without that buy-in

861
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,899
it's it's a massive part this is we're

862
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,159
getting into the social side of things

863
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,419
right

864
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,000
um and then execute go through your plan

865
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,520
again really like I know people always

866
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,899
say like go through your plan again to

867
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,399
look everything over I mean really do it

868
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,039
like spend time on this because this is

869
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,480
where people get pissed when you turn on

870
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,240
that Tool uh and then improve and this

871
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,919
is where you fix everyone being pissed

872
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,159
this is where you immediately bring in

873
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,020
staff level

874
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,360
uh principal level Engineers to talk to

875
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,159
about the tool that you just did you

876
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,360
communicate with them because you know

877
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,500
them because you've already built those

878
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,320
relationships right right all right

879
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,200
um and then you also make sure you get

880
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,120
in the higher level the people who were

881
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,220
had you get to get their Buy in and then

882
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,340
some newer Engineers you need all points

883
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,020
of perspective you know if this is too

884
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,240
complicated for someone who just started

885
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,799
developing at the company then you need

886
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,380
to make some adjustments for it so you

887
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,240
need to look at it from All Points

888
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,820
so I'll put my slides up somewhere but

889
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,059
this is like an sdlc uh

890
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,700
this is actually one that I just did so

891
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,860
this is real I think I took all the

892
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,899
important stuff out

893
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,880
yeah just making sure I'm not like

894
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,380
throwing my company under the bus on

895
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,240
anything but these this is the way that

896
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,559
I go I look at everything in

897
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,539
architecture you deliver

898
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,140
your develop release your iterate and

899
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,940
then continuous Improvement and you know

900
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,620
you can see all the like normal apps of

901
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,860
stuff in here we got SAS and SCA you got

902
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,299
your container scanning and

903
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,100
configuration

904
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,380
and then you have some other you know

905
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,240
pull request review like where you

906
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,980
actually have to check each other's PRS

907
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,380
I know it's crazy but uh you can't just

908
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,179
in devsecop environment you can't just

909
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,059
let guys go wild but

910
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,260
um you know and then you get into some

911
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,360
of the fuzzing and all this kind of

912
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,159
stuff right I mean this is pretty

913
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,779
straightforward you can look this stuff

914
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,899
up but this is all stuff that does work

915
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:52,260
so you need to look at a list like this

916
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,899
and I'm always available I Mentor people

917
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,640
and and I consult on things and stuff

918
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,600
like that

919
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,399
I can help you kind of go through this

920
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,340
kind of stuff and figure it out

921
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,960
so your first control should be

922
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,640
completely holistic based on your

923
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,740
company but here's some thoughts don't

924
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,720
start with sassed I've already said this

925
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,000
once SAS is a great control is not the

926
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,700
first control everybody loves SAS SAS

927
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,159
vendors love SAS I don't know they like

928
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,020
took over conferences for too long you

929
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,880
could piss off everybody uh pick and

930
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,220
control low false positives writing

931
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,600
policy for backup your control with

932
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,820
buy-in is a great idea secure coding

933
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,799
standards is something you need I wrote

934
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,480
all of ours for a company and guess what

935
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,760
I'm not the best developer but I studied

936
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,799
this stuff I learned it and I wrote the

937
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,600
policies for it oh wasp all that kind of

938
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,220
stuff has great information on those

939
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,320
kind of things

940
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,760
again cookies and beer because you'll

941
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,500
piss people off and you need to be

942
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,419
thoughtful you know I think that's

943
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,620
something we forget about when we're

944
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,899
trying to build these These are actually

945
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,820
programs that will affect thousands of

946
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,919
people's daily life like

947
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,559
don't make everybody's life suck we want

948
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,240
to care about people

949
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,880
um that's my shift not left backwards

950
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,140
sign

951
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,200
trigger warning for all your appsec Bros

952
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,480
or broets or whatever people who get

953
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,460
super psyched on the stuff don't get

954
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,700
dazzled by shift left sales guys lie not

955
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,320
all of them I was in sales that's why I

956
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,419
say this uh sometimes better off

957
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,460
shifting right for the first control and

958
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,380
you always should end up left you want

959
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,679
to get down down there but shifting

960
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,820
right you have far fewer false positives

961
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,980
um so then your next controls

962
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,019
different for each team uh these are

963
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,159
just some questions I threw in there to

964
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,539
kind of help you think about things but

965
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,700
do you have a budget a lot of code

966
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,240
issues shift left SAS SCA

967
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,279
you hate your developers

968
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,200
um is it just you and you're overwhelmed

969
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,299
security Champions programs are awesome

970
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,299
I love them and slack Bots are awesome

971
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,399
if you can ride a slackbot you can

972
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,720
change people's lives because you know

973
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,880
what slackbots do they answer stupid

974
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,159
questions and we don't like stupid

975
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,600
questions so we make a select button

976
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,039
it's awesome

977
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,260
um hired some folks got a little team

978
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,539
going embedded security Engineers one of

979
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,640
the best controls there is I'm embedded

980
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,620
on a team of people who are all smarter

981
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,179
than me but for some reason they think I

982
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,000
know security and it works is there some

983
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,980
fancy new product coming out

984
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,199
threat modeling and SRA security risk

985
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,780
assessments those things are really

986
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,639
really really important and can save the

987
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,599
company

988
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,520
hundreds of thousands of dollars if they

989
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,800
put out some sort of product that you

990
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,359
could have threat modeled and change the

991
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,460
code's base change the way that we

992
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,080
implement it use a different you know

993
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,359
AWS procedure whatever

994
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,280
and they don't have to go back they

995
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,839
don't have to have 30 to 40 devs working

996
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,418
on it for a month to fix it that's money

997
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,480
so that's your value right there you

998
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,859
just save the company x amount of

999
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,359
dollars and you need to learn how to

1000
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,879
tell people how much you've saved

1001
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,300
so what worked for me uh for that was a

1002
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,580
hair trigger uh what worked for me for

1003
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,800
first control most recently I did a dast

1004
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,140
uh and threat modeling I found an

1005
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,880
engineer he's going to be a security

1006
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,400
Champion later she actually uh we

1007
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,500
grabbed a quick meeting light thread

1008
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,000
modeling discussion we went over this

1009
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,359
kind of area uh took burp Suite crushed

1010
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,119
some stuff worked real hard to make sure

1011
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,500
that I'm not handing them a bunch of

1012
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,180
false positives then I got with that

1013
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,339
actual engineer went over those to make

1014
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,560
sure there aren't false positives and

1015
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,820
we're like no these all look real

1016
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,460
they're exploitable your mediums and

1017
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,200
your lows usually aren't

1018
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,820
we looked at their crits and all those

1019
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,859
kind of things and then popped in jira

1020
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:32,099
guess what everybody trusted me and this

1021
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,540
is starting from scratch I was the only

1022
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,320
guy

1023
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,060
they trusted me and they got it done

1024
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,880
that week all of it

1025
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,619
that's because I put the legwork in not

1026
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,540
because I'm good at any of this

1027
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,599
anybody can do this if you're nice or if

1028
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,760
you have a bad personality but you care

1029
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,079
about people those are the two things

1030
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,700
remember that

1031
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,920
um so embedded with engineering I talked

1032
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,079
about it a second ago but embedded

1033
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,839
security Engineers this is huge this is

1034
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,400
new appsec if you have enough people to

1035
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,339
map to product get your app set guy in

1036
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,500
there in the stand-ups listening they

1037
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,119
don't need to write code some I have a

1038
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,400
couple guys that do a couple that don't

1039
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,680
I do every once well my code's not

1040
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,260
always great but um you know it's

1041
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,420
important uh they can also get ahead of

1042
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,500
those threat models because they're in

1043
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,460
those meetings they know it's coming

1044
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,320
they can get ahead of the security risk

1045
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,460
assessment because they're looking at

1046
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,260
the jira tickets coming through

1047
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,400
um it shouldn't take up all their time

1048
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,460
I'm in stand-ups 10 minutes three times

1049
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,440
a week plus planning meetings for an

1050
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,359
hour every two weeks on sprints

1051
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,400
that's not much time right I have

1052
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,500
visibility in the company I know what's

1053
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,060
actually happening in the code base

1054
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,619
how many apps like Engineers can say

1055
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,560
that like really say that it's a it's an

1056
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,820
amazing control

1057
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,560
so tools

1058
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,140
two Acquisitions long and hard uh you

1059
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,359
got to do it right trust the hype sales

1060
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,820
guys can be sketchy uh all my sales guys

1061
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,560
like at the booth are probably just

1062
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,540
cringing every time I say that

1063
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
um less tools you can do to do your job

1064
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,560
is the better you don't need 18 things

1065
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
if you have budget you're just going to

1066
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,740
make everybody crazy

1067
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,900
um build a plan before you can acquire

1068
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,839
tools uh centralized location for

1069
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,700
everything in the beginning if you map

1070
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,079
this out in the beginning and you have

1071
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,720
data coming into one spot you will have

1072
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,400
a lot better because I've had it for the

1073
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,140
15 Spots I'm clicking through different

1074
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,700
tools every single morning trying to

1075
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,440
figure things out when all I had to do

1076
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,540
was write a few API calls and some silly

1077
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,040
stuff in the beginning and my life would

1078
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,480
have been better

1079
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,200
um

1080
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,140
yeah test the tools API before buying

1081
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,400
that's a big one

1082
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,900
how can you be a billion dollar company

1083
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,880
and your API sucks

1084
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,820
I don't get it no cyber security if I

1085
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,440
had a newspaper I'd hit certain

1086
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,940
companies over the nose with it because

1087
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,520
it's horrible how bad their apis are I

1088
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,720
just don't get it they're billion dollar

1089
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,099
companies

1090
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,140
um and checkout lost awesome stuff in

1091
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,920
there

1092
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,300
sorry I talk too much so I'm trying to

1093
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,560
push through a little

1094
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,300
um no budget no toys

1095
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,160
so how do you get budget you've talked

1096
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,540
about value right talk about how much

1097
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,099
money we've saved the company talked

1098
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,140
about how much money it'll cost the

1099
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,640
company if they don't give us money it's

1100
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,040
like extortion it works

1101
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,079
um but that's what you do you know

1102
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,480
don't jam up engineering plan everything

1103
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,300
out good metrics build those bridges

1104
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,280
that's how you like start to get in

1105
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,480
there you start to understand these

1106
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,720
things useful metrics

1107
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,359
metrics are stupid if they're not done

1108
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:21,780
well no one cares about your stupid pie

1109
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,720
graph that doesn't make any sense they

1110
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,220
drive me crazy it's like the biggest

1111
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,400
waste of time out of all the meetings I

1112
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,780
sit through are metrics meetings so make

1113
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,599
them count make them tell a story ask

1114
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,640
the people that you're accountable to

1115
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,220
what story needs to be told and build

1116
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,380
your metrics to tell that story and

1117
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,820
that's also for continuous Improvement

1118
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,220
get your metrics to build and show you

1119
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,900
where you're failing and where you're

1120
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,180
improving and then you can change the

1121
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,380
way you're doing things this is

1122
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,359
continuously improving things it's

1123
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,339
important

1124
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,200
um I love Education and Training it's

1125
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,880
the biggest thing

1126
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,540
um it's super hard it's so so hard uh

1127
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,380
there's

1128
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,119
a million different things but if you're

1129
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,200
building those relationships you're

1130
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,040
going to figure out what you can do

1131
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,800
lunch and learn ctfs buying some

1132
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,359
software all the kind of cool stuff

1133
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,880
you'll figure it out because you know

1134
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,520
the people that you're working with if

1135
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,599
you don't know the people you're working

1136
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,940
with I understand some of you have 15

1137
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,220
000 person developer companies it's just

1138
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,780
you're never going to know it so you're

1139
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,920
just going to buy a software and send it

1140
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,359
to them that's better than nothing right

1141
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,520
but if you're in a company under a

1142
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,140
thousand people you should know what

1143
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,000
they really need you should also know by

1144
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,560
the vulnerabilities you're pulling if

1145
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,880
they're making the same mistakes all the

1146
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
time guess what do a lunch and learn

1147
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,359
build a CTF on that vulnerability teach

1148
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:39,359
them these things don't be a jerk

1149
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,640
okay social engineering security culture

1150
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,160
good social engineering benefits both

1151
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,079
parties they know their audience they

1152
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,180
have buy-in from all parties needed to

1153
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,800
build a culture based on trust and

1154
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,079
visibility and servant leadership I know

1155
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,359
it's corny but I love it uh bad social

1156
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,240
engineering self-focused goals does not

1157
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,940
benefit all parties manipulation zero

1158
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,859
visibility using the stick instead of

1159
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:02,760
the carrot does that sound like your

1160
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,040
manager that sounds like your manager

1161
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,420
I'm sorry because I'm finally at a good

1162
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,800
company but I've been around those

1163
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,940
managers a ton in the industry so

1164
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,160
uh educational programs we kind of

1165
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,140
talked about that I'm running a long

1166
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,460
time so we're just crushed through that

1167
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,920
uh continuous Improvement one shitty

1168
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,900
control can ruin your whole program

1169
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,420
I guarantee you if you just let SAS run

1170
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,220
and you don't tune it it will ruin your

1171
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,560
whole program uh you need to refine

1172
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,320
everything this is just the way that we

1173
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,480
get better at what we do automate

1174
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,160
everything you can because there's not

1175
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,320
enough of us it's a it's a small group

1176
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,780
of people and be customer focused your

1177
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,060
engineering teams they're your customers

1178
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,820
you love them you learn to nerd out with

1179
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,140
them on everything that they care about

1180
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,359
and make their life better not harder

1181
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,800
and it and you really can't and be

1182
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,380
objective in where you suck this is

1183
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,520
super important if you want to be good

1184
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,660
at this job because everything's

1185
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,060
constantly changing and you you get a

1186
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,700
big head about things uh you're not

1187
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,900
going to see that

1188
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,599
so these are some ways forward there's

1189
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,240
no one size fits all plan everybody's

1190
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,740
company is going to be different and I

1191
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,300
can't tell you what to do this just work

1192
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,520
work for me and I know I talk with

1193
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,500
authority like I figured it all out but

1194
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,940
I'm just a knucklehead that doesn't

1195
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,980
really know anything but I've had some

1196
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,720
success in appsec so thank you guys so

1197
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,160
much for your talk does anybody have any

1198
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,399
questions

1199
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,279
go ahead

1200
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,839
in my mustache

1201
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,260
um this is a mix of insecurity and

1202
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,119
arrogance

1203
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,900
it's it's hard to figure that out

1204
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,280
yeah go ahead

1205
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,420
yes

1206
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,060
I have amazing visibility with up to sea

1207
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,119
level I know CEO CEO and CTO on a

1208
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,160
personal name basis I can call them or

1209
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,079
slack them anytime I want even though I

1210
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,420
have a director between me and them

1211
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,820
um my director has meetings with the

1212
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,500
rest of our trust team which is Our IT

1213
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,960
team and they make sure that everybody

1214
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,060
knows the controls that we have planned

1215
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,020
for the next two and a half years as

1216
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,119
well as engineering we're super big on

1217
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,240
visibility no secrets in our company

1218
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,820
good question oh and sorry he asked what

1219
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,280
visibility do we have uh for our two and

1220
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,980
a half year plan on controls

1221
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,760
does anybody else

1222
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,880
run tools

1223
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,660
yes

1224
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,599
ah

1225
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,060
how do we

1226
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,800
portray to leadership that we need the

1227
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,839
extra time to build these relationships

1228
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,880
and take a holistic approach threat

1229
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,079
model those kind of things basically

1230
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,880
instead of the old school like buy tool

1231
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,500
run tool piss everybody off in the

1232
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,520
company

1233
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,420
um you have to come in honest I try not

1234
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,859
to get hired

1235
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,540
I came in and said if you want me to run

1236
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,400
this appsec program

1237
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,140
this is how I do it

1238
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,880
I need time

1239
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,400
and if I cannot build relationships you

1240
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,140
will not have a successful appsec

1241
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,000
program you need to tell your your your

1242
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,920
leadership now that even if you're

1243
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,140
already hired be like listen

1244
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,720
this weird guy made some sense for the

1245
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,160
first time in his life

1246
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,200
and we need to build relationships and

1247
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,819
he's like you're an idiot go run the

1248
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:39,720
tool

1249
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,359
but you can show value in making

1250
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:46,079
progress if you start small find a find

1251
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,660
a group of people pour into them ask

1252
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,220
them like what do you need how can we

1253
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,020
make this safer what's going to make

1254
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,819
your job better but we're still going to

1255
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,920
like grow in our security knowledge and

1256
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,359
all those kind of things because you're

1257
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,099
actually social engineering a culture

1258
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,619
that's the trick here if you can to the

1259
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,900
devs yeah if you can social engineer a

1260
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,300
security culture into their group

1261
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,099
then you don't need a hundred security

1262
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,780
Engineers because they become the

1263
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,920
security engineers and they know the

1264
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,900
code's so much better than we do

1265
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,460
so that's usually how I do it I try to

1266
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,800
do small things and and I'm really

1267
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,200
honest like okay I tried with this guy

1268
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,780
he hates me but this guy likes me so I'm

1269
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,280
gonna see what I can get done over here

1270
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
and we're going to leave them alone for

1271
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
a little bit and it really does make a

1272
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,339
sense

1273
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,420
did we roll our own threat modeling

1274
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,180
program okay so funny enough when I came

1275
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,819
onto the company there was nobody and uh

1276
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:40,920
and then someone the VP of security took

1277
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,800
a leave for like a few weeks uh going

1278
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,900
through some stuff and he was like

1279
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,760
you're good at threat modeling just

1280
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,020
threat model so yeah I wrote out an 11

1281
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,960
page how to threat model document

1282
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,319
maybe I wrote too much uh we and then I

1283
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,119
threat modeled the entire company I met

1284
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:01,619
with all the Architects I met with devs

1285
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,599
and I sat down and Drew out these

1286
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,640
horrible drawings because I didn't want

1287
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,960
to use threat Dragon so I just used

1288
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,300
Google Docs because I'm dumb dumb and

1289
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,940
then uh now we're at the continuous

1290
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,099
Improvement stage and me and another

1291
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:15,359
security engineer because now we have

1292
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,099
like eight people or something or seven

1293
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,220
and uh me and him are going through and

1294
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,099
revising it and making it uh basically

1295
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,319
to a more Elite level we're using

1296
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:28,560
programs to help us have a macro view of

1297
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,540
it and then also for individual products

1298
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,980
and stuff like that

1299
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,920
um but yeah o wasp has some really good

1300
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,560
stuff on their threat modeling and it's

1301
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,119
a great place to get started but I think

1302
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,440
everybody kind of needs to write their

1303
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,060
own policies

1304
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,440
um and if you have if you get stuck with

1305
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,119
that kind of stuff we're all people

1306
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,700
don't be like you know I was definitely

1307
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,859
like worried about writing policy for a

1308
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,420
company I'm like who am I the Right

1309
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,220
policy I'm an idiot

1310
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,839
um but then you realize oh yeah

1311
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,000
everybody else is a person too and and

1312
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,020
if you write something that's

1313
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,460
personalized for that company it really

1314
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,260
does change like the way everybody looks

1315
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,099
at it

1316
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,140
anybody else before I get off one more

1317
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,500
you're all screwed

1318
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,300
no no

1319
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,400
she she asked uh what what are our

1320
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,200
thoughts for larger companies with uh

1321
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,359
with embedded security Engineers

1322
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,400
um

1323
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,200
it depends on your leadership if you can

1324
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,420
figure out how to tell your leadership

1325
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,060
this is what really does work embedded

1326
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,700
security engineering works and we could

1327
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,140
prove it

1328
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,480
um you might be able to hire

1329
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,220
chances are you won't

1330
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,619
so you do the best you can because

1331
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,480
that's all we can do right so if you can

1332
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,940
get you know if if you have you start

1333
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,619
breaking up by product then you start if

1334
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:44,760
you don't have enough for product then

1335
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,680
you start breaking it up by

1336
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,240
um you know I don't know I hate to even

1337
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,099
say like front end you have one front

1338
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,960
end one for back end and that person you

1339
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,520
know jumps around I've definitely had it

1340
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,480
where I'm on four different product

1341
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,640
teams and I'm doing a ton of meetings

1342
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,020
while we're trying to hire and stuff

1343
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,520
like that and it still works you still

1344
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,920
have visibility you need to figure out

1345
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,800
some way to get visibility in there no

1346
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,480
matter what and that's the really tricky

1347
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,880
part right you have to be creative we're

1348
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,440
in app set because we're creative

1349
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,839
criminals like so we got to figure out

1350
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:14,220
good things to do I know everybody's

1351
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,260
like I'm not a criminal I am so deal

1352
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,079

1353
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,940
