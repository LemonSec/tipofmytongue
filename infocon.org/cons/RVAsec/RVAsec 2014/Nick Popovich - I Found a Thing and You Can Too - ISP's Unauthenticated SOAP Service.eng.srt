1
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,310
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get started then with the</font>

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,220
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the introduction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cruft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:28,770
we'll dive into the tech good afternoon

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">my name is Nick Popovich and what I</font>

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,050
wanted to do to give you the opportunity

6
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to leave if this is not your cup of tea</font>

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,269
it's just kind of sum up the talk from

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> get-go so what this talk is going to</font>

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,820
be about is using a let me preface it so

10
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my way to</font>

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,290
I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cursory obfuscation of</font>

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,330
the isp's name and I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,740
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my way to say their name but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending a room full of very smart people</font>

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,680
if you figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that's fine but I</font>

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to draw attention to the</font>

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,440
specific eyes peas name because that's

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,730
the knot of point of the talk the point

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,610
of the talk is about the process the

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,860
research and the outcome so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind</font>

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,570
of a little boilerplate I have up there

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,040
so the longer the short of this

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion is I use the ISPs own</font>

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,790
software do I have to identify a flaw

25
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,829
that allowed me to do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font>

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,070
should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do the first</font>

27
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,408
phase was associating the bssid to the

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,110
wireless network names with public IP

29
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,640
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then as I dug in a little</font>

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,740
bit I found that I could pull wireless

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,540
encryption keys and some other data and

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,908
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about that we're</font>

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,800
also going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process of</font>

34
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,050
which I disclosed this finding with them

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,240
and it's kind of a wind because in the

36
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,500
information security community you tend

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,330
to see a lot of horror stories when

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,580
you're reading online of white hat

39
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,229
researcher prosecuted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scary</font>

40
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,850
things now let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me preface this was</font>

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,679
saying I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a legal advice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

42
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,309
this is legal advice but it's my story

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,710
in my my situation I kind of want to use

44
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,210
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a win and an encouraging encourage</font>

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,048
others to do some of the similar

46
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,119
research but it's not legal advice and

47
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,340
it's a nice set out its when responsible

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,720
disclosure goes well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font>

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,628
neat and not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sometimes</font>

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,590
the big media it likes to so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

51
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,590
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit little about me</font>

52
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,489
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentester right now I have a</font>

53
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,340
background in the military working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

54
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:26,020
the DoD financial sectors done sysadmin

55
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,849
and defending networks and also

56
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,050
attacking network so kind of got to do a

57
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:32,709
lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a father of</font>

58
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,630
two and a husband to one my wife feels

59
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:38,020
like it makes no sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all it's cool</font>

60
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">and leaving it I suffer from my wife</font>

61
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,430
calls it the curious hermit syndrome I

62
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,079
don't I don't turn it off<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I work I</font>

63
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people in this room</font>

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,410
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing you just you</font>

65
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't unplug and everything you want to</font>

66
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,890
put everything under the microscope one

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,640
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons I gave that give this</font>

68
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:57,339
talk to is to inspire those of us who to

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,540
give some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the products that we don't</font>

70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,400
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> during our nine to five or</font>

71
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,109
whenever we're working we have a certain

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
role and then to not turn it off and to

73
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,930
put the products that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use in our home</font>

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,459
environments or whatnot that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not get</font>

75
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,989
as much scrutiny under the research

76
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,260
microscope you'd be surprised what you

77
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:16,360
see and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't stop tinkering and I'm</font>

78
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:19,390
also a veteran so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for thanking</font>

79
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,980
me for thinking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for think so one of</font>

80
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,440
the points of this is a small office

81
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,268
home office home gear it has recently

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,700
started to come into light with some

83
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,920
folks reverse engineering some firmware

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,260
but for the most part it's it's not

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,850
given the the granular inspection as

86
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,798
much of the enterprise class gear gets

87
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,108
because enterprise-class gear has their

88
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,910
own QA shops and then pen testers or

89
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,280
security assessments find flaws in that

90
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,739
gear so this is kind of an area that it

91
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,120
slides under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the radar to a degree like</font>

92
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said I want to encourage the research</font>

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,959
i'm nothing special the front row

94
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,410
especially will tell you i'm nothing

95
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,570
special but this is an opportunity to

96
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,000
see using some very simple tools and

97
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,880
just being inquisitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found a lot of</font>

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,140
neat stuff talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just wanted an excuse</font>

99
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,060
to talk about it was cool tinkering and

100
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,040
then again go over my disclosure so

101
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">briefly tell you a story about how this</font>

102
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,970
all happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> i moved and i had to move</font>

103
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,920
my internet service so the major<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp</font>

104
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,380
sent out a technician<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my house after</font>

105
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,389
he moved the service and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

106
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">right thank you you know hook up the</font>

107
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:27,420
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done he was like</font>

108
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,240
here I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

109
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,060
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sketch a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> USB into your computer so</font>

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:40,010
I can get credit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work and I like</font>

111
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:42,420
uh not exactly comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that but</font>

112
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,190
so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he was like look I need to</font>

113
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,930
run some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools to test the line</font>

114
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,340
and I don't get credit for this visit if

115
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,140
I don't do this I need and I was like

116
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,669
all right so I I pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> up my linux laptop</font>

117
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,740
it's like oh we don't we don't support

118
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:58,530
mac calm<font color="#CCCCCC"> down on it so I spit up a</font>

119
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,510
windows vm one of my throw aways and he

120
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,280
plugs his USB in and all of a sudden the

121
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,860
page launches and all these green dials

122
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,719
start going green<font color="#CCCCCC"> and red and I'm just</font>

123
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,460
like whatever man it's fine you do your

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,050
thing I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way and</font>

125
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:15,210
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> he left he said won't tell you</font>

126
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:22,790
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rah I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you about</font>

127
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:26,210
the the agent software that we have for

128
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,220
your management of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

129
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,870
so he says you can do a lot of these

130
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">things with this let me show you and he</font>

131
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,870
installs the installs some product on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

132
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,370
VM goes about tinkering and says you can

133
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,350
do some interesting things with this you

134
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,670
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about your wireless</font>

135
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,560
network you can reset your router

136
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,060
password you can reset your network

137
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,650
password you do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it's</font>

138
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,450
really cut down on our support calls we

139
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,780
should we really suggest folks install

140
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,900
this application and I was like I didn't

141
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,270
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine and so</font>

142
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,239
he left and I'm thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

143
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,669
later I need to go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

144
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,500
reset the router password and set the

145
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,970
security settings for wireless and of

146
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,620
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot what we had set it at</font>

147
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,120
feel like interesting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was still up</font>

148
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,670
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this VM I hadn't turfed it</font>

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,460
yet and I went in I said let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

150
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,930
reset the router password and so I put

151
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,169
in new pay and didn't prompt me for the

152
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,690
original one I said curious and I set

153
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,600
the password and I could log into my

154
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,430
router look when I was orphaned session

155
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,500
or if something<font color="#CCCCCC"> has persisted from what</font>

156
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,870
he was doing earlier can't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

157
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,250
simple so I turf the vm spent up another

158
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,970
one download the software install it

159
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">they changed my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password and I without</font>

160
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,889
prompting me for a new one it allowed me

161
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,780
to change the router password

162
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,580
this is peculiar and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

163
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,679
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was going on deeper so I</font>

164
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,680
started to dig in because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

165
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,560
understand how this binary was working

166
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,020
and communicating with my router so I

167
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,879
spun up wireshark and it was confusing

168
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,400
to me actually raised more questions I

169
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,139
saw some gets I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> some stuff in</font>

170
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,739
responses that was confusing to me where

171
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,150
it was simulating mouse clicks and there

172
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,800
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some stuff that wasn't making</font>

173
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense to me so I said let's let's take</font>

174
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,029
this a different place I'm also seeing

175
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,539
these posts and there's password values

176
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:17,310
pre-populated and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're it I didn't</font>

177
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,490
understand just by watching the wire I

178
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,689
needed to go deeper but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

179
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,129
things I noticed as I was watching

180
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,560
Wireshark there was a lot of encrypted

181
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:28,500
traffic with an internet IP address and

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,360
I expected this traffic to be primarily

183
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,419
on my land I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it needed to</font>

184
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,949
call out and saws like this is peculiar

185
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,349
one of the things I noticed was the name

186
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this major</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP in the certificate</font>

187
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:45,750
info for the TLS connections I was like

188
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:48,150
peculiar let's go deeper so what I did

189
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,740
was I proxifier this was an application

190
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,378
that wasn't meant to natively accept a

191
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,360
proxy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got some neat</font>

192
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows app that lets you it's kind of</font>

193
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,770
like proxy chains on Linux it lets you

194
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,500
force non proxy aware applications over

195
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,649
a proxy so I just proxifier all

196
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,870
connections i was using burp and to

197
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:10,110
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to continue what I had to do is</font>

198
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,699
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> installed a burp CA or you could</font>

199
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,409
create your own as long as you your

200
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,680
browser trust the ca so it doesn't

201
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:18,599
interrupt the ssl connection it works

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,599
configure burp to use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I configured</font>

203
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:25,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">burp to generate a self-signed SS a</font>

204
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:27,539
self-signed search that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,520
certificate and then it was important to

206
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,789
allow to configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> bbqs invisible</font>

207
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,559
proxying just because this was new to me

208
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">and some folks aren't very familiar with</font>

209
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,630
invisible proxying what it is is non

210
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,819
proxy where applications don't submit

211
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:46,980
requests in a way that something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

212
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:49,620
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to use a proxy would so it</font>

213
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,560
doesn't use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the host that</font>

214
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,840
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get it uses the host</font>

215
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,859
header so a non proxy aware request

216
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,420
looks like the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> one where it's</font>

217
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,800
getting a page and it uses the host

218
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,469
header to say which hosts it's going to

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,370
a proxy aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> request will put the name</font>

220
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:09,330
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> holster you're going to in the</font>

221
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,400
actual get or in the request itself so

222
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,070
that was a big key with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

223
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,569
proxying especially from a vm or

224
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,900
anything if you're forcing something

225
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,180
over a proxy that's not succeed to

226
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:26,340
enable invisible proxying or else it

227
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:28,620
doesn't work well so as I'm watching

228
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,180
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this traffic via burb now I can</font>

229
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,970
see everything because I can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

230
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,640
the SSL and I start seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

231
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:39,870
interesting requests so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

232
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,910
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this strange string and</font>

233
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,830
I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is there were soap</font>

234
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,069
verbs occurring so this was a soap

235
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,300
service over the internet and just from

236
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's nothing really interesting on</font>

237
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,030
here except this good-looking strain

238
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,570
just kind of keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in your mind as</font>

239
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,970
we as we progress so another request

240
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,470
that's initiated and also let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me preface</font>

241
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,840
that the traffic you're acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

242
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,190
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it's starting up I spun the app</font>

243
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,600
up and I'm watching what happens I

244
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,610
haven't started to manipulate the app at

245
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,790
all this is just spin up traffic so I'm

246
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,470
seeing these keywords go and I see this

247
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">gooey session ID and it looks if you</font>

248
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,830
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gooey session ID it looks</font>

249
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">very similar to what was there before</font>

250
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:22,980
but in the midst of it is a public IP

251
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:24,540
address interesting so I took note of

252
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,550
the keyword values I took note of this

253
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">gooey session ID which seemed to persist</font>

254
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:32,880
on the requests and I start to get a

255
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,650
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tort as what I'm starting to see</font>

256
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,710
these are requests coming from my

257
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,140
machine also take note of this keyword

258
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,910
value line record cv1 we'll talk about

259
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,670
that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit but we see my pc mac</font>

260
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:51,750
being sent we see my hostname we see my

261
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:54,300
windows username and so this was the

262
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,250
request my privacy hackles are going up

263
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,199
a tad why do you need my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac address but</font>

264
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,670
who cares but why do you my mac address

265
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,680
well you my windows username if this is

266
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:05,160
my corporate laptop here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sending a</font>

267
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,650
major ISP data that why<font color="#E5E5E5"> am i sending</font>

268
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,610
this data now the response piqued my

269
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,860
interest quite a bit

270
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,130
and notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keyword this this server</font>

271
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,540
text reference seemed to be a column

272
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,850
response so you have a keyword that you

273
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,040
request the soap service and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

274
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,620
text reference was kind of the response

275
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,290
to that so I kind of figured that

276
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:28,829
earlier we<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw this is line record cv1</font>

277
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,569
and then we see cached lrm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> cv1 must</font>

278
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:32,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">be like cash to value one or something</font>

279
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,899
that because i'm seeing a cached line

280
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,689
record here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started to put that</font>

281
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,190
together just in my head but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

282
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">response contains things that really</font>

283
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:46,200
bothered me namely my zip code my state

284
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:50,070
my phone number my username for now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

285
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:53,550
didn't use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ISPs email but that</font>

286
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,899
had my username there so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

287
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,640
not started to interrogate this

288
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,370
application at all this is me watching

289
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,380
the traffic as it's starting up we see

290
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,209
the gooey session idea again and it

291
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,769
seems to continue to persist it just has

292
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,569
these random series and numbers it

293
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,029
appears and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up producing</font>

294
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,209
is my way an IP address in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gooey</font>

295
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:17,180
session ID so we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this keyword is</font>

296
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:22,290
sent this<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC IH a Wi-Fi info keyword</font>

297
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:26,339
what it returns is my wireless network

298
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:28,829
name and my wireless network key in my

299
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,320
encryption type and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like goodnight</font>

300
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:35,069
moon that's not cool and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font>

301
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">from all this traffic is coming from the</font>

302
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,260
internets I would be okay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to a</font>

303
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:44,839
degree if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from my personal</font>

304
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:48,810
router but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm full-on super curious</font>

305
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:51,630
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing that just started</font>

306
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,300
getting me something that I took note of

307
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,630
was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this data that started</font>

308
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,420
sending up my operating system type my

309
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,860
security type for my my wireless network

310
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,290
my wireless network name security type

311
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,110
it had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard-coded that key ended up</font>

312
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,569
being what was printed on the tag<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

313
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,940
on the router that you get from these

314
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,690
folks but August and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it sent my</font>

315
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,069
legit wireless key<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sent what what</font>

316
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,920
this is not clear text so that's a good

317
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:22,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">point the data this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all ssl</font>

318
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,849
thankfully

319
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,270
but it's still data that's being sent

320
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:30,480
from me to them and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enjoying it</font>

321
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:34,680
oh just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things my</font>

322
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">disks disk sizes that are free all this</font>

323
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">data and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess you know in one stance</font>

324
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,020
some folks like the more data the better

325
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,500
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just still don't understand what's</font>

326
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,860
going on so I said let's let's check

327
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,510
this out maybe when the tech was here a

328
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,730
tech ID or because it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new install</font>

329
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,530
this is all new so I shut the app off

330
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,840
turn it back on watch it again same

331
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,640
thing happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's do the changing</font>

332
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,110
of the password now I'm changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

333
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,240
password on my router this should never

334
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,460
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to the Internet</font>

335
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:10,380
I don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I should so I I changed</font>

336
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:12,900
the password on my router and all of a

337
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,760
sudden after I changed my password it

338
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,850
reinitiate s'posed and sends the newly

339
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,540
changed password to the internet and I'm

340
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:24,330
call this my selfish phase at this point

341
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,069
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really just worried about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me and my</font>

342
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">daytime like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

343
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:32,640
my isp is collecting this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

344
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,050
also did I still wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

345
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,330
why it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

346
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,410
biggest problem if it was all local

347
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,300
communication with my router locally

348
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,490
would be different and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

349
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,920
things that I noticed was after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

350
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,360
initiate this communication with their

351
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,750
at the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> would communicate</font>

352
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,940
over the internet a lot of posts and

353
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,280
gets would start shooting over to my

354
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,180
router I didn't quite understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

355
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,280
yet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are the questions that I'm</font>

356
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,930
curious about but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> only focusing on</font>

357
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:08,490
myself and my data now I started

358
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,859
wondering what's used for authentication

359
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,540
because I didn't see much for

360
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,420
authentication on flight it has to be

361
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,410
some you know maybe just basic cookies

362
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,300
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can't be cookie because I</font>

363
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,829
remember as I was testing I saved some

364
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these requests and I started standing</font>

365
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,970
on with no cookies and we're still

366
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,280
getting the same data it's like there

367
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,020
has to be some secret sauce with in this

368
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,610
whole process<font color="#CCCCCC"> an authentication</font>

369
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,620
occurring there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta eat maybe it's a</font>

370
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:35,699
layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't see maybe it's a network</font>

371
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,470
layer so I try this from another isp

372
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,549
like I went to my father-in-law's house

373
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,079
he's got a whole different provider I

374
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:42,959
tried this process and I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

375
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,329
same data about myself because I was

376
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,829
saving these burp requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're saved</font>

377
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:49,049
that I'd run on my network so I'm just

378
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:52,618
being careful because I I really did not

379
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:55,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to tread I thought this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is um this</font>

380
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,910
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a scenario where this during when</font>

381
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,709
we was going through all the sense and

382
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,600
sentencing stuff like that I'm like you

383
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,219
know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got I'm a father I've got kids</font>

384
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,019
I love doing what I do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font>

385
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to jail because I'm curious so I was</font>

386
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,009
focusing on myself and my data but I did

387
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:10,410
wonder i was like i wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i can get</font>

388
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,669
anybody else's stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wasn't really</font>

389
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,019
going to try it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was just</font>

390
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:19,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">some sort of rabbit hole I didn't feel</font>

391
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:21,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">like going down at the time so I wanted</font>

392
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">more info though I so what I did instead</font>

393
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:25,199
of just passively watching it work I

394
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:27,629
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with all the different</font>

395
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:32,998
knobs and switches on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

396
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:34,199
and one of the funny things so I just

397
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:35,790
every option was there I started

398
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">clicking through it every place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could</font>

399
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,569
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in put I just started watching the</font>

400
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,209
data as it went by I started running<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

401
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:44,519
again I was never running any like

402
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,589
attacks like using a burp scan against

403
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,470
this site I was just watching the

404
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,759
traffic never trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuzz or</font>

405
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:54,179
manipulate the inputs I was just putting

406
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,529
in data like 123 and whatnot so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

407
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,299
playing around just learning how the

408
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,619
software works watching it so I was

409
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,089
watching it with process hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

410
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:02,189
various windows tools to see what it did

411
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,809
watch how it touched the file system

412
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,789
what registry keys used burp just

413
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:09,299
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch all the traffic that</font>

414
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:10,980
it generated over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I started</font>

415
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,439
to make a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these keywords and</font>

416
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,089
I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of understand how at</font>

417
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,860
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I could understand how</font>

418
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,418
this soap service on the internet was

419
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,188
working based on these keywords and

420
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,779
responses and requests so when I so I

421
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,579
just kind of started to map the business

422
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,359
logic or how I thought the business

423
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,349
logic of the application worked and

424
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:31,139
while I was going through is kind of

425
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:35,449
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up finding that they</font>

426
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:40,620
used auto it to write this application

427
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:42,450
so and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a discovery that was by</font>

428
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,158
accident cuz I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like auto it it does</font>

429
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,279
some funny things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's neat</font>

430
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:48,960
little wrapper for<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows coding it is</font>

431
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,399
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

432
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,279
installed on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> VM that I was using</font>

433
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:55,229
for research and as I was inspecting the

434
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,600
file system i noticed just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

435
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,490
default autoit binary logo when you

436
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,480
compile an auto it it has the default

437
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,130
logo there and it was there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

438
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,450
like oh so I put reversed in quotes

439
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,860
because it's not real reverse

440
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,720
engineering the reverse engineers here

441
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,100
would throw things at me if i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

442
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,169
reverse-engineered an auto at binary

443
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,908
because it's it's not exactly

444
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:18,390
legitimately compiled and there are

445
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:20,760
applications that you can use to get the

446
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,240
source code of auto it scripts from a

447
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,440
from an executable so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did and I</font>

448
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,539
started looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the source of the</font>

449
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,240
binary that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of runs the show for</font>

450
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this whole application and one of the</font>

451
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,039
things I noticed was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gen good</font>

452
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,928
function down there and remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

453
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,100
earlier i said it looked like a random

454
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:43,020
string of numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then my IP address</font>

455
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,709
well it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> random string of numbers and</font>

456
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:54,059
your way an IP address is this good it's

457
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:56,340
from their binary now I occur I don't

458
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,090
remember let's go that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

459
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you want to keep reading the code</font>

460
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:06,330
unicode so the accident remember when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

461
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,919
said this was my selfish face and I was

462
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,510
focused on my data in my own I was

463
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
curious about others data but I was like

464
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Naga I'm not going to go beyond</font>

465
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,830
maybe I started saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> well maybe I'll</font>

466
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,200
tests family and friends who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

467
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,090
the same ISP and we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,880
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really was being kind of</font>

469
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,668
trepidatious with the whole process well

470
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">ah it was near</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas time so I went</font>

471
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:32,159
on vacation and I rested and relaxed and

472
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:34,230
it was great so after Christmas I spin

473
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,700
up my saved burp<font color="#CCCCCC"> States and I start</font>

474
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:42,120
submitting the same requests again to

475
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:44,429
get data back and so as I'm looking I

476
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,899
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and my way an IP is right the</font>

477
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,240
keywords are right you noticed i removed

478
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:50,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cv one because what I found out was</font>

479
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,500
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you moved anything with cv that was</font>

480
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,059
cached value so you could get live like

481
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,350
you could query the query the data from

482
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,210
the database rather than so maybe cash

483
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,490
database anyways removing manipulating

484
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,850
some of the keywords and removing values

485
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:05,160
ended up giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> me fresh data</font>

486
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,780
and so here we're sending the same line

487
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,000
record same<font color="#CCCCCC"> gooey session ID from back</font>

488
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,100
in the day same way an IP address but I

489
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,590
pulled new data and I also notice the

490
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,510
the response is new content and it's

491
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,639
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other dude zip codes some other</font>

492
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:21,780
dudes<font color="#E5E5E5"> username some other dude city</font>

493
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:25,200
nearby city but some others do stuff I'm

494
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:29,580
like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> just happened here this is not</font>

495
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,990
good stuff also as I'm watching because

496
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,050
the process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going i started the</font>

497
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,390
application it's just running now sends

498
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:40,379
this keyword with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GUI session ID</font>

499
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:43,110
from before and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get his WEP key and</font>

500
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm like we know what that could be just</font>

501
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,679
the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> value this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably not</font>

502
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:52,260
live data this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

503
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,700
fluke and what's the situation so let me

504
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you what had happened I discovered</font>

505
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,110
my way and IP changed over Christmas

506
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,379
like we lost power or whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

507
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,760
may be so so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this data</font>

508
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,130
and I'd had a theory i was like that

509
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,580
gooey session ID is all over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

510
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something important well</font>

511
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,510
what I accidentally tested after coming

512
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,280
back from break was the gooey session ID

513
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,560
was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of used as your identifier of</font>

514
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,720
who you are and a surrogate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some sort</font>

515
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">of form of authentication but the gooey</font>

516
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,450
session ID just had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look like the</font>

517
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:27,210
format<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was generated in so if it</font>

518
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,300
looked just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and you jamming</font>

519
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,790
away and IP address in the middle of it

520
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:38,480
you are now querying data as that user

521
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:44,159
from over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet and so it's like</font>

522
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,200
it was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> accident total accident so I'm</font>

523
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,100
kind of worried too I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like do I call</font>

524
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,930
the isp and do i bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up do i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

525
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,270
turf all my research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put my head on</font>

526
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,670
her pillow and hope it goes away will

527
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,830
they care will they care in a good way

528
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,720
will they care in a bad way what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

529
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't fix it that was the question that</font>

530
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">i asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that bothered me what if they</font>

531
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't fix it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost felt like a social</font>

532
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,190
responsibility because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm like here's</font>

533
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the situation a selfish phase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm like</font>

534
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's my data up there i am not the</font>

535
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharpest tool in the tool shed people</font>

536
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,800
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have already discovered this or</font>

537
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will eventually and all</font>

538
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,149
sudden they're pulling data out there

539
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:23,280
and I was like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I started to</font>

540
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,110
hype myself up I was talking my wife I

541
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,639
was like I'm a customer I have a little

542
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:30,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more right to go in and be like I</font>

543
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,200
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but not adversarial II just</font>

544
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,210
go in and say this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

545
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,510
we should address but I was also scared

546
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:42,630
because you know weaves going to jail

547
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:45,270
for pulling email addresses so it's it's

548
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:49,290
such a gray area i sat on it for a while

549
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:51,930
and I decided the best approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

550
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be adversarial to be as a</font>

551
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,330
concerned customer and to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

552
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,310
carried myself with you no decorum and

553
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:03,659
professionalism and went as a as an

554
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:10,440
emissary and not an adversary so my

555
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:13,980
process in this it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to find</font>

556
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,470
a point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact that made sense or</font>

557
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,970
that could could understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

558
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,670
saying cuz I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

559
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,770
points of contact and I didn't want to

560
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know just go out and be like hey who</font>

561
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,370
do I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so I was I called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

562
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,690
actually called first line support like

563
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,639
who you'd call if you're in turn it down

564
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,310
I was like I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

565
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,810
about this issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they didn't</font>

566
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,580
understand they put me to their manager

567
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,649
they didn't understand and i actually

568
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">have chat logs i was trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have due</font>

569
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,850
diligence and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

570
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,930
this appropriately and document records

571
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,949
because at first i was calling I was

572
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,830
like wait there's no records of these

573
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,010
calls let's use the chat system chat

574
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:52,830
system was a terrible idea they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

575
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,960
idea they had less idea and so I'm going

576
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,840
through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was months of me and I</font>

577
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,190
was also not aggressively trying to

578
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,899
because I was still nervous I was like I

579
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this but I don't want</font>

580
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:07,460
to be adversarial when I did find a

581
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,100
point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact a friend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine on IRC</font>

582
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,980
was like here's the deal I have a guy

583
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,719
who might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the appropriate</font>

584
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,450
channel for this thing so one of the big

585
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:26,640
takeaways from this for organizations

586
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:28,380
especially is make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious on where</font>

587
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,480
folks can reach out to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I</font>

588
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,270
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I even tried to send to like abuse</font>

589
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,549
at the name calm and send emails to

590
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,590
folks because I was like it's not this

591
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a different concept of bug bounties</font>

592
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,799
I'm not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say companies need to</font>

593
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,418
have a bug bounty Avenue and folks

594
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,309
because it you know there's a whole big

595
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,049
discussion on does that encourage or

596
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:48,240
discourage type but if a legitimate

597
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:49,918
customer has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem they need to be</font>

598
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to contact somebody and then have a</font>

599
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,630
process in channel so the cool thing was

600
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,669
is after this they actually enacted some

601
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,730
new processes that made it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

602
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:01,080
this is funny I found this person I was

603
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,059
given this person's email address i

604
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,590
emailed<font color="#E5E5E5"> them pretty late at night</font>

605
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,030
expecting to talk to them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

606
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,030
days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got a response in seven</font>

607
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,678
minutes i emailed them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they said</font>

608
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is an issue can you be on a call</font>

609
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:18,540
tomorrow I said cool so I stoked by I

610
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:21,960
amped myself up for the pro would come

611
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,909
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said all right I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

612
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">in and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to focus on I'm a</font>

613
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,620
concerned customer I'm not doing

614
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:33,179
malicious things I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment you</font>

615
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:36,439
as an advocate not an adversary and in

616
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:39,480
this case they were super appreciative

617
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,960
and I got on a conference call<font color="#E5E5E5"> with like</font>

618
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,400
nine people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crazy thing was is</font>

619
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,320
they didn't you know make me sign a

620
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,690
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ndas they were really focused</font>

621
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,370
on thank you for identifying this now

622
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:54,540
let's fix it and so they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me with</font>

623
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,040
there were security team there was

624
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">instant response team there were lawyers</font>

625
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,790
there were developers there were

626
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,840
managers everybody in the world and they

627
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:05,190
but they weren't accusing me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

628
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:10,320
one of the takeaways from that is I came

629
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:12,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">at them with a lot of humility and I was</font>

630
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,760
just as a concern and I kept reiterating

631
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:19,440
that I didn't want this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a case</font>

632
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,030
where they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody was</font>

633
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,070
hacking them or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that this</font>

634
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,379
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just me I kept using terms like</font>

635
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:30,840
passive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was passively watching traffic</font>

636
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">I passively doing things they actually</font>

637
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,189
fixed the issue in a couple of days they

638
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,190
asked me to test

639
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,320
I they call me<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like so we put in</font>

640
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,870
some mitigation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we fix it was funny</font>

641
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,120
too because it also demonstrated how in

642
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,739
IT and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sometimes there's a</font>

643
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,540
divide between the information security

644
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,130
department and maybe developers or

645
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,300
frontline support because you had the

646
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,090
security team on and they're like well

647
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,889
is there anything else after we talked

648
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">about like well you know you guys use</font>

649
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,870
auto it for the binary that's not

650
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,610
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise class and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

651
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,780
guys like what you thought of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

652
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,949
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah there's some log files</font>

653
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,840
that are stored locally on the machine

654
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,510
that contain data that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

655
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,040
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all of a sudden I'm like a kid</font>

656
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,020
at the dinner table<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching their dads</font>

657
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,129
by kind of quiet like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't dad or mom</font>

658
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,410
fight because you're quietly sitting

659
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,150
there while the security teams like what

660
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,630
he saw and we didn't get to assess it

661
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,890
and there's and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font>

662
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,660
but then they came together and it was

663
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,670
neat to watch this process as they

664
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,860
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gel and then get on the same</font>

665
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,540
page and they started well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

666
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change the processes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

667
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:40,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be reviews and it was pretty neat</font>

668
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:41,900
and later on they actually gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

669
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,250
called a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I never</font>

670
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,280
expected hear from them they they they

671
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,080
fixed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the fix was basically and I</font>

672
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,639
did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> go beyond what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they asked me to</font>

673
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">do because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm staying within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

674
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,480
parameters and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope of what they</font>

675
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,610
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> they said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all I did was some burp</font>

676
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,780
requests that i had saved and then what

677
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,830
ran the app a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and it</font>

678
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:03,470
started to do 30 ones and got a 501 time

679
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,760
but it didn't work the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font>

680
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,980
originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> showed the network and that</font>

681
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,460
is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do because i'm</font>

682
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,360
still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little trigger shy at this point</font>

683
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,340
so they called me a couple weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

684
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,250
they say you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really appreciate</font>

685
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're obviously a big target for</font>

686
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,140
folks because it were a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p and</font>

687
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,610
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool and they gave me a</font>

688
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,870
discount on my service they gave me free

689
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,459
service for like a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a</font>

690
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:32,750
discounted service and they gave me

691
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:37,010
kudos which is awesome so summary of the

692
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,480
research oh this is coming up on on some

693
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,740
of the things that folks had asked

694
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,670
questions about before that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

695
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure i touch so those affected this</font>

696
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:49,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not every customer of this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p it</font>

697
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:51,380
was only those customers who a ran the

698
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,690
gear that they give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when they you</font>

699
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,080
know

700
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:58,110
router and also subsequently ran this

701
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,970
agent software that communicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

702
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,820
actually ended up finding somebody who

703
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,679
had their own gear a business who had

704
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:10,860
their own gear like they had an a ese oh

705
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:13,019
thanks thank you and I i checked with

706
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,658
their permission<font color="#CCCCCC"> i checked i used their</font>

707
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,919
way an IP address put it in the GUI

708
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">session ID started using their</font>

709
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,490
information and was pulling back nothing

710
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was pulling about lying record</font>

711
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,750
data but nothing so it seemed like the

712
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,529
it factor was you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use I speed</font>

713
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:29,940
gear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had to use their software</font>

714
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:32,759
folks were curious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the fix</font>

715
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,850
was last time I spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this like I</font>

716
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,190
said I didn't go deep dive because I was

717
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:42,000
done with my accidental discoveries for

718
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lifetime but like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said they</font>

719
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,620
enacted something that didn't allow you

720
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,769
just to use the GUI session ID as a

721
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,209
random excuse me they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let</font>

722
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:53,429
you use a lan IP address and the GUI

723
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,200
session ID as the authenticating factor

724
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:57,870
that lets you pull data on that customer

725
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,909
using their way and IP address and and

726
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:07,139
and it was a an interesting without that

727
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,460
was it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could only confirm that i</font>

728
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,918
could no longer pull other's info

729
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,750
without authentication one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

730
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,299
was is when i used the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of</font>

731
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:18,539
the software the data was still being

732
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:21,210
pushed pulled and sent and they told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

733
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:23,519
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a feature that they want support</font>

734
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,559
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be yea big quotes on that it's a</font>

735
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,269
feature that it cuts down on support

736
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,460
calls and I said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know here's a</font>

737
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:33,720
problem with that just in general I was

738
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,600
like if I'm on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same network as this</font>

739
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,620
gear I can reset the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router's password</font>

740
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,149
because there was still no

741
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,768
authentication occurring you know once

742
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:45,120
this process happened you could still

743
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:46,169
just reset the router's password and the

744
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,059
only thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is be on the</font>

745
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:49,740
same network like well if you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

746
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,320
network your trusted I was like that's

747
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,370
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that you you view it they</font>

748
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,210
say well we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

749
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:59,129
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some changes but the point I was</font>

750
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,110
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make was just because</font>

751
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:01,980
somebody's trusted on on the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum</font>

752
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,149
that doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trusted you</font>

753
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,830
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody comes to my house I</font>

754
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:05,340
don't want them resetting my router's

755
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,169
password

756
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">word and change the dns settings and all</font>

757
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:14,520
that silly stuff like good call<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

758
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,649
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> under review so if you still</font>

759
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,510
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the latest version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the product or</font>

760
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:21,210
or earlier ones the data is still sent

761
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:24,720
and it's it's basically how the the

762
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,370
software works so my prophecy hackles<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

763
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,710
still said I'd really you know

764
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,659
appreciate this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like well</font>

765
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,670
we don't you don't we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

766
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,830
have to do this sounds like you have it

767
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:37,410
your technicians really want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

768
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:41,250
done and average<font color="#E5E5E5"> dose no user are going</font>

769
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,810
to happen I'm just barely above an

770
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,610
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Schmoe user and I let it</font>

771
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen because I guy was like kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

772
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get credit for this install if I</font>

773
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,540
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda are having</font>

774
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:55,710
a systemic flaw that is this data is

775
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:58,050
getting scooped up so yeah the fix I

776
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,370
can't confirm<font color="#E5E5E5"> nor deny I can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

777
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,169
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just told you doesn't work</font>

778
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore so what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

779
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,460
takeaways of this well first of all

780
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:13,560
disclosure can go right and you've got

781
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,390
to you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to weigh it and discuss it</font>

782
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,550
and talk about it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I can't</font>

783
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,050
say every situations<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be roses I</font>

784
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,389
can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me and</font>

785
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:25,860
the way I approached it worked well and

786
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:28,080
had it had a decent outcome also this is

787
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,629
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of implicit trust in the</font>

788
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,600
various applications we have running in

789
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:36,090
our environments is not exactly a good

790
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,010
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's the old saying that the</font>

791
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:41,459
Cobblers kids have no shoes you know

792
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,530
sometimes folks in infosec we work or in

793
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,200
IT and I te at all or whatever industry

794
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:48,780
you're in we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to work in our jobs</font>

795
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,730
and then our environments don't get as

796
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:55,980
much speculation a granular we don't

797
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at our environments as closely as</font>

798
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,650
we may our corporate environments or

799
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,170
environments we're assessing and whatnot

800
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:03,030
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's funny you know a lot of folks</font>

801
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,800
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> have probably just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no man in the</font>

802
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of your phone and watch it over</font>

803
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,760
burp and just watch all the madness and

804
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,860
stuff is happening if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just run</font>

805
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,480
wireshark say you have a gateway device

806
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,699
or you just run wireshark on your

807
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,860
environment just from your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc your your</font>

808
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,809
home computer whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run watch the</font>

809
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,689
wire you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just start to see</font>

810
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,980
a lot of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're curious why</font>

811
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,419
are these connections happening that's

812
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,419
how this started and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encourage</font>

813
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,470
that I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go home today turn</font>

814
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,139
on their computers and start

815
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,639
categorizing and putting a list and

816
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,529
saying what do these connections what

817
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:37,110
are they for because you'll be your mind

818
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:39,029
will be blown and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

819
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,649
things is its<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of still on our</font>

820
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:42,659
shoulders as a community of

821
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:46,289
technologists security professionals and

822
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,269
folks that care about this kind of stuff

823
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:50,908
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring this to light because obviously</font>

824
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,769
in this case this was a flaw that they

825
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:56,490
hadn't heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about or had been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font>

826
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:59,610
about and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like quasi our</font>

827
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:02,220
responsibility sometimes to take the

828
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,570
effort to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in the research and in</font>

829
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,539
this case I got some free service which

830
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:09,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">is cool but I didn't expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything and</font>

831
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:13,079
everything I did was using free tools I

832
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,770
used just the intercepting proxy feature

833
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,839
on burp i was using wireshark and i was

834
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:21,569
using process hacker most of these tools

835
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,869
are free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're really well</font>

836
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:28,710
documented everybody here<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this</font>

837
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:30,050
type of research I kind of said it in

838
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,730
the beginning but this is the warning

839
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,770
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out me like well Nick said it</font>

840
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:38,040
was cool to do all this stuff so I'm

841
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:39,899
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go do it and talk to him yeah</font>

842
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,790
the disclosure went well in this case

843
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:43,679
they were super appreciative I can't say

844
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,500
it'll happen every time could have taken

845
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,149
a turn for the worst easily I feel like

846
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,159
it's it's a sad state of affairs but

847
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:53,040
most cyber laws are up for such

848
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,359
prosecutorial discretion that it's the

849
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,190
mood of the prosecutor that day do they

850
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:59,700
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a name for themselves do</font>

851
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:01,619
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to how do they want to apply</font>

852
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,750
various laws that deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with computers at</font>

853
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:06,960
cyber security so if you come at them

854
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,000
hard and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent your system and</font>

855
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">I got all these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay me or you</font>

856
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,859
come at them combative and adversarial

857
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">II I tend to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the outcome may</font>

858
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,779
have not been<font color="#CCCCCC"> so amenable for me but I</font>

859
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,369
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> at them with a lot of just trying</font>

860
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,960
to good vibes good vibes good lives

861
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:28,079
don't sue me don't arrest me don't do

862
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:30,099
things and it worked I just spread the

863
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,619
IT love

864
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:35,410
also let's just use discretion in common

865
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if when you're looking at</font>

866
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:44,710
tools and you're doing things don't do

867
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,940
things you know or wrong my mom used to

868
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:50,049
say don't do things you know we're wrong

869
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:53,109
didn't work think of the consequences

870
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:55,440
your mom must have said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too so</font>

871
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:57,880
another aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of guidance</font>

872
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,739
in this community we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

873
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,880
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRCs we have mailing lists we</font>

874
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,380
have conferences where we can get

875
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,849
together that's one of the things why

876
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,759
conferences are so value because you can

877
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:08,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">get together with peers and discuss</font>

878
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:11,410
things and I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of advice on how</font>

879
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:13,450
I should carry myself a lot of I got the

880
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,170
point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact from up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I got</font>

881
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:18,848
the opportunity to bounce off ideas and

882
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,430
say you know how should I proceed if it

883
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:24,460
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the peers and my colleagues</font>

884
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,710
helping move some guidance I think it

885
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,470
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone differently as well and</font>

886
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:31,089
then kind of to go back to my point 0 as

887
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,410
a community info SEC has the

888
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,058
responsibility because we have them

889
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,670
sometimes we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools we have the</font>

890
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:38,619
mindsets and we have the passion because

891
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,960
I love this stuff I do it day in day out

892
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:42,849
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn it off my hobbies are</font>

893
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,210
involved all of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I love to</font>

894
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:47,799
do when in<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt you can do the</font>

895
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,180
disclosure anonymously so that it gets

896
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,038
fixed yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get</font>

897
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">accolades you may not get your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name on a</font>

898
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">CVE and you're definitely not gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

899
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,369
free cool service but at least the flaw

900
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:58,749
is fixed that was my biggest concern

901
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:00,249
mainly because I was selfish I was like

902
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:03,249
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> date is in there I don't want some</font>

903
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:05,529
dude grab my stuff because I at first

904
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:08,799
considered disclosing when I just was

905
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:10,509
like I can map public IP addresses to

906
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:13,930
wireless network names I was like that's

907
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:15,400
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decent day that I get and then</font>

908
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,169
I started seeing encryption keys that

909
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,019
worked let me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back i'm sorry i missed</font>

910
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">a part of my story so before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i missed</font>

911
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:24,488
before I did the accidental disclosure

912
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:26,680
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> no right after I did the accidental</font>

913
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:30,999
disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to a couple friends</font>

914
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,440
and I said hey here's the research

915
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,238
here's what I'm doing let me just check

916
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,739
if this is legit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see my data</font>

917
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,259
and it's legit I don't know if your

918
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:39,519
stuff is real or not I can't test so I

919
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:41,229
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a friends I was like what's your</font>

920
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,720
way an IP you're like what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wayne</font>

921
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:47,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">ivey as i go to buy it</font>

922
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">by IP com read me the number there and I</font>

923
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:49,750
said and he said here it is I said cool

924
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,060
so I did the request and I pulled his

925
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,130
data I was like is this your web key he

926
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,680
was like what swept I was like it's

927
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,090
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your fridge go it's the</font>

928
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,230
thing it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you type in to</font>

929
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,330
connect your<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer he was like oh</font>

930
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,390
yeah let me go he goes back and ruffles

931
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,770
and he's like yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my web key she</font>

932
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:09,220
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I found somebody</font>

933
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,900
that was not using web I said let's do

934
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,950
this let's pull your data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I pull the</font>

935
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:17,230
data now a caveat to this research<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

936
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:20,290
the middle of it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped being able to</font>

937
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:23,050
retrieve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> WPA keys for folks do using</font>

938
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,009
wpa and wpa2 and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it's</font>

939
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,690
because the data wasn't there anymore

940
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,830
it's because the keyword values change

941
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,650
because I started getting errors when I

942
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,720
was pulling that data when I was testing

943
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,760
it then I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> only testing on folks that</font>

944
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,118
I went and got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the permission individual</font>

945
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,180
customers that were also<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends of mine</font>

946
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,190
but originally I was able to pull that

947
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,020
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I verified it that it was the</font>

948
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:47,050
real data that they used for their

949
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks so it was live but so we're at</font>

950
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,200
one point when in doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> disclose</font>

951
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,390
anonymously because the key is getting

952
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,609
it fixed yeah i agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the no more</font>

free bugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> i agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the people's</font>

954
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:58,598
should be paid for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their work and again</font>

955
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into kind of a bug</font>

956
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:04,150
bounty discussion my I care about the

957
