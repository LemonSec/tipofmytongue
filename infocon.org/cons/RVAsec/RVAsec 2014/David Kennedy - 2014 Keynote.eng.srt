7
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,480
to be centric around looking ahead and

8
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,210
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where we're going and where I</font>

kind of see us moving to and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,910
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meet we should change</font>

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,140
probably for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the positive to make it a</font>

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,970
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,100
in security and I'll talk about that a

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,080
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit intro is already done but I'm</font>

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,769
and my wife I asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> permission</font>

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,239
afterwards and I didn't go so well but I

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,579
still have the full sized artists had to

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,379

<font color="#CCCCCC">right-hand side there where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:04,690
special moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Paris and this is not</font>

24
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:08,590
photoshopped it is not photoshopped that

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:11,020
is one hundred percent legit now it's

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">not about me but I happen to be on the</font>

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,100
Katie Couric show recently and it was

28
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:16,780
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of funny because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they had an act</font>

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,250
were coming up next which was last names

30
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,380
cumberpatch<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's like the guy that plays</font>

31
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,520
Sherlock I guess he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a super sexy</font>

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,289
guy or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't i don't know</font>

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,658
yeah he looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good guy i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess it</font>

34
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,340
but uh what was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny about that</font>

35
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,900
is it said up next one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world's</font>

36
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,820
sexiest men alive and then removed the

37
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,360
up next piece and it just had me there

38
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:37,059
with the picture but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,570
it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just going</font>

40
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,850
to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's legit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

41
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,648
so this talk you know when I when I give

42
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,030
talks about different topics or things

43
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:47,740
like that what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to do is I like to</font>

44
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,210
focus on what's relevant right now and

45
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,740
where we're heading cuz they could we

46
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,720
focus a little bit too much on what's

47
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,000
actually going on I guess in the past we

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,170
have a lot of trouble looking ahead so

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,790
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk soon be looking at what</font>

50
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">hackers are doing why they're going</font>

51
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,390
after certain things and unless we

52
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,200
really change what we're doing we're

53
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,700
going to be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going down a</font>

54
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,490
slippery slope that we continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

55
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,869
around security so this talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

56
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,489
geared around looking ahead and trying

57
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,380
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how we can learn from our</font>

58
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,910
mistakes and learn from ourselves to

59
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">make things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better and I have to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

60
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,019
mean we are getting we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting</font>

61
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">better exponentially since when I first</font>

62
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,720
got into the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry I mean</font>

63
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,459
everything from when I spent two years

64
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,989
in Iraq doing cyber warfare stuff too

65
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,660
and when we got back and you know I got

66
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:27,340
into the to the commercial side we've

67
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,470
gotten a lot better i mean i think you

68
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,550
know we see security<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a lot</font>

69
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,990
more in the news you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot more</font>

70
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the board of directors I mean I had a</font>

71
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,400
CIO that was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my good buddies for</font>

72
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,510
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortune ten company and he was in the</font>

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,890
middle of giving his presentation and

74
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the board of director stopped him and</font>

75
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,929
said hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are we doing around</font>

76
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,609
heartbleed what are we doing around

77
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,140
security man that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great we're getting</font>

78
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot more visibility than we ever have</font>

79
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,359
to have to capitalize on that using the

80
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,530
right way so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the past</font>

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,390
impression I mean we're seeing large

82
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,650
data breaches still and that's nothing

83
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,760
new I mean if you look at a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

84
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">different statistics out there we</font>

85
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,510
continue to see a lot of large breaches

86
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,440
and each of them appear to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be from</font>

87
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,299
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we missed that was</font>

88
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably pretty stupid right I mean</font>

89
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,310
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sequel injection or you</font>

90
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,990
know event a third party vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you</font>

91
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,490
know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we missed it's</font>

92
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,680
unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it only takes one</font>

93
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,090
small thing for us the basically

94
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,010
crippled our entire organization and

95
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,630
that's a pretty bad stance I mean if we

96
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">are just waiting for one flaw to be</font>

97
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,090
exploited and all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it</font>

98
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,609
takes care of our entire environment

99
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,470
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue and so we're in this</font>

100
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,820
kind of reactive stance right now we're

101
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">really trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build up our defenses</font>

102
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,810
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is like right now I</font>

103
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,420
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the by off to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

104
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,500
right and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money to go and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

105
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,268
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> right these some of us are</font>

106
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,130
getting to that point but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

107
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,269
we've neglected security for so long in

108
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,410
our environment because we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

109
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:39,730
been we've been preaching security for

110
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,959
like years right we're like hey we need

111
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,549
this we need this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more people</font>

112
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,110
and like now can't do it now I can't do

113
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,640
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now can't do it and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden</font>

114
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have in we're like oh now we need to</font>

115
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,458
get this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and buy this and put</font>

116
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,900
this in here we're forgetting about all

117
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,150
the stuff that we've been neglecting for

118
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,150
the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now we're at a</font>

119
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,340
point now where we're trying to catch up

120
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the reason that we have</font>

121
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this issue is the ability to detect</font>

122
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,950
right now a skilled attacker is really

123
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,570
difficult I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at look at any way</font>

124
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,220
that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and target a web</font>

125
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,660
application you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we</font>

126
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,220
have a laugh in place but<font color="#CCCCCC"> by passing</font>

127
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,019
laughs are trivial or getting around

128
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,549
next-generation firewalls or whatever

129
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,739
you're trying to do I mean let me ask a

130
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,730
question is anybody here know every IT

131
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,180
project that's going on in your

132
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,918
environment right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now no right do you</font>

133
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,540
know any every business application all

134
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,880
your assets normal data versus non

135
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,380
normal data yep all that like mapped and

136
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,930
you're actually looking at know right so

137
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,510
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are we supposed to see hey</font>

138
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,700
this is legit this is not legit because

139
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,050
our apt prevention<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool said it was</font>

140
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,789
probably malicious I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

141
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,410
going to work right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not at a</font>

142
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,630
point yet where that's going to work so

143
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,770
it's really difficult time and you know

144
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,889
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give an example I'm going to</font>

145
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,330
show you a quick dinner

146
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,469
you it's a like a two minute thing that

147
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,080
did on the Katie Couric show because its

148
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:49,969
resonant to me at least going after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

149
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,310
company has never been more easier for

150
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:53,659
us as attackers I mean getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> after an</font>

151
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,949
organization saying listen I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

152
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,180
target an employee I'm going to go after

153
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,770
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> web application i'm going to do</font>

154
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,060
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> has never been easier the</font>

155
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,340
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that we put on</font>

156
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,439
line is insane like<font color="#E5E5E5"> linkedin for example</font>

157
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">i love LinkedIn everybody loves bragging</font>

about themselves on linkedin like hey we

159
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,819

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,919
and our monitoring section program is

161
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,689

or your Palo Alto is whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

171
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,770
that you're implementing and know how

172
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,969
much sure you are in that environment

173
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,250
now so thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting all that</font>

174
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:32,930
information on there and what's nice

175
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,550
about companies is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like it's</font>

176
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,050
targeting one individual when you're

177
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,729
targeting one person it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult</font>

178
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,750
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you literally have to make</font>

179
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:40,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's believable and if you</font>

180
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,960
don't then they're going to be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

181
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,310
hey something something happened here

182
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,719
and I probably need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

183
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,249
suspicious or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cautious</font>

184
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,870
of what's happening resident company

185
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:49,939
have a thousand people or 10,000 people

186
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,900
I can go after you have 10,000 assets

187
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,669
and everything else out there then go

188
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,560
out there so that one flaw makes it much

189
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,180
easier for me so in this case in the

190
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,650
Katie Couric show they asked me to

191
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,270
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack into somebody in the</font>

192
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,469
audience we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> permission and</font>

193
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,698
everything but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reaction is</font>

194
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:04,279
really good and it should just<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

195
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,839
how easy it really is interesting enough

196
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,089
about this this wasn't staged in any way

197
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,860
shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> or form I got consent prior to</font>

198
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,960
actually going and doing it obviously

199
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,310
but her reaction is priceless and what

200
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,989
you should kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of take away from this I</font>

201
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,550
guess is that how easy it is just a

202
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,349
target one individual how easy it is

203
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">really target</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a national</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation</font>

204
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:25,819
two teenage daughters she lives in

205
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:27,949
Connecticut and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stephanie I understand</font>

206
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:31,729
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you believe your computer is</font>

207
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:33,050
unhackable why well I'm something that's

208
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,508
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my mind I'm very concerned</font>

209
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,089
about it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like all of my antivirus</font>

210
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:41,490
software is up to date I've taken a lot

211
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:44,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">of precautions I I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where 20</font>

212
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,030
comes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> my home to check on these</font>

213
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,280
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really feel strongly that</font>

214
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,710
that we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything possible to</font>

215
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,090
try and protect my<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

216
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,669
daughters I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that's</font>

217
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,530
really working for me well that that's

218
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,260
very impressive because you seem like

219
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:02,020
you're extremely ahead of the curve so

220
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,200
we decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> David to the test to</font>

221
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,960
see if your comfort level with your

222
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,360
security is actually warranted tell us

223
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,210
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> how did you do when we</font>

224
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,770
gave you the challenge of happiness<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

225
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,260
that's a look of like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just messed you</font>

226
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:24,130
up really bad and I can't wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

227
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about it Stephanie's computer so you</font>

228
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,400
know Stephanie I would say was actually

229
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,770
one of the top 5% of what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is</font>

230
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,450
being most secure you know everything up

231
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,849
to date really<font color="#E5E5E5"> locked down all those</font>

232
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,920
good things and so I literally had

233
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,360
plugged into my computer up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and less</font>

234
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,700
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes or so had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it fully</font>

235
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,740
designed go pick actually an actual

236
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:54,210
sound here if it tries out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay not</font>

237
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:54,210
rattling not a good key pipe it through

238
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:05,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright let's go back to the original</font>

239
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:07,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">song i sent an email out and as soon as</font>

240
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,089
i sent the email looks very believable

241
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,919
in every way she clicked a link and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

242
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,150
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there again less than 10 minutes of</font>

243
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,680
set of time and hacking and all that

244
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,650
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had full access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to her computer</font>

245
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,960
her webcam got around Oliver antivirus

246
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:25,179
everything completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow so tell us oh</font>

247
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,989
my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you were able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it so</font>

248
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,520
much worse this is when I started

249
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">feeling like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad person like I</font>

250
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,860
was I was all<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited like I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

251
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,209
tell her then her reaction gets worse

252
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,870
and worse the words I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> who I'm so</font>

253
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:40,598
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like guys well the first</font>

254
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,828
thing we did is we enabled her we

255
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,599
enabled her webcam we were actually able

256
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:44,739
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor everything that was going on</font>

257
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,959
in her house everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from her</font>

258
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,279
daughter working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our computer it says</font>

259
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,199
stephanie actually walking through the

260
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,790
house itself we actually enabled the

261
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,079
audio as well so we could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

262
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,490
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was going on at the same</font>

263
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,489
time let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a listen to copper</font>

264
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,459
like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty bad about that</font>

265
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,410
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna lie not really I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

266
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,149
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty cool at the same time</font>

267
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know hey whatever but it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crime</font>

268
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,610
example of how easy it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into</font>

269
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,680
somebody's computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took me 10</font>

270
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,880
minutes open<font color="#E5E5E5"> my laptop love go to you</font>

271
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,959
know figure out what her name was and

272
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,339
then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there polar social security</font>

273
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,660
number then pull over data for a bank

274
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,220
information and then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you know</font>

275
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,389
send her a targeted attack you know what

276
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,190
she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in 10 minutes you know and</font>

277
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,319
then it was ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and i'll set so</font>

278
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,959
that was an easy one but targeting

279
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:29,610
corporations just as easy and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

280
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,680
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me personally is i think we really</font>

281
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,720
have right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> an over reliance on</font>

282
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,790
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm not saying technology</font>

283
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,839
as bad in any way shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> or form but it</font>

284
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,610
has to already<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an established</font>

285
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,980
program in place in order you to use

286
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,019
technology let me ask a question for

287
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,639
next-generation firewalls for example so

288
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,170
you have you know you've had let's just

289
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,360
say an a sa in place for like the past

290
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your people that you</font>

291
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,420
have in your not your network engineers

292
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,649
and early elves are really so familiar

293
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">with these ASAS because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've used</font>

294
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,259
them for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years then you</font>

295
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,550
completely rip that out and you put a

296
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,709
whole new appliance in place what do

297
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,699
they have to do now you have to relearn

298
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,750
everything now and now what else are

299
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">they doing they rebuilding your entire</font>

300
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,569
network infrastructure all the firewall

301
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,949
rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else I'm asked a</font>

302
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,139
question does anybody here doing like

303
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:08,459
proper network segmentation like a HR

304
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,510
can't talk to sales and sales can't talk

305
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,800
to whomever and ye like have

306
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,819
compartmentalize information you're

307
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,579
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be in talking</font>

308
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,620
since like the 1990s know and are you

309
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:18,899
actually looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data is no</font>

310
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,399
so now you put this next-gen firewall in

311
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's like hey it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font>

312
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,720
like a piece of malware over the network

313
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,480
which is what antivirus does anyway so

314
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,010
cool right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have this over lance</font>

315
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,389
and technology i'm not saying a next-gen

316
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,399
firewall isn't the way to go it's just

317
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,560
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have certain things in place</font>

318
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,389
before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put technology in place let</font>

319
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,979
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask another question is anybody here</font>

320
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,649
of enough funding period for their

321
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,449
entire security program very laughs

322
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,819
right it's ridiculous right we don't me

323
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:46,380
know right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now ask another question do</font>

324
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,339
we have enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to support the</font>

325
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,470
technology and everything else that

326
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,760
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our environment no I relapse</font>

327
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,810
again right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so we don't have</font>

328
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,790
enough people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have enough</font>

329
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,229
technology so then what we do is we go

330
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we buy a piece of technology right</font>

331
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,889
and we spend like like five years

332
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:00,689
building this piece of technology out

333
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,639
then we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the industry is</font>

334
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:04,860
telling us we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go to big data big</font>

335
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,910
data big data big data so now we scrap

336
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,899
everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done before</font>

337
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,399
we buy this whole new piece of

338
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,170
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough people</font>

339
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,579
anyway so that stuff's just like blinky

340
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,079
lights

341
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,219
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we invested</font>

342
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,359
into all this stuff just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes out the</font>

343
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,709
water we hit with a hammer because we

344
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,790
don't know what it does anymore can you

345
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember the credentials to get into the</font>

346
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,799
box and now we're focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data</font>

347
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:23,299
that's what we're taught to do stick

348
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,410
with the skin technology at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

349
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,639
building your program out so you're

350
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,170
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something decent instead of going</font>

351
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,029
on buying new pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology you</font>

352
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,199
don't need it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now so i'll talk</font>

353
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:33,170
about that in a second all right don't

354
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:35,059
call me crazy an auction proven so again

355
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,679
see methods of attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean are my</font>

356
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:38,329
techniques as an attacker when i was in

357
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,649
the military and I got out I was

358
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:41,388
breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into corporations whether it</font>

359
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,329
was a bank or you know medical industry

360
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:46,160
or something else my same methods of

361
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,529
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years ago or the same methods</font>

362
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,639
I have for today<font color="#CCCCCC"> like exact same like I</font>

363
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:51,769
haven't changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

364
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,839
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool stuff folder in my in my pen</font>

365
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,100
test box that is like stuff I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

366
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,019
use because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool but I can't</font>

367
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,100
use because we all stuck right now so

368
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,720
I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this stuff</font>

369
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,160
folder because I can do cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but</font>

370
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,449
nothing stopping anything else I'm doing

371
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,639
from 10 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so we have to</font>

372
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:06,109
worry about it so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still sequel</font>

373
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,029
injection still patching slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> fishings</font>

374
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody know the number one way that I</font>

375
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,309
still break into corporation today

376
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:15,949
number one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not social</font>

377
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:20,118
engineering surprisingly default

378
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:22,008
passwords it's great you're welcome one

379
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,919
or your summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2014's or whatever you're</font>

380
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,749
using your unbelievable they are still

381
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,699
way better than any exploit ever in the

382
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:29,959
history of exploits so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have to</font>

383
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,790
worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> like doing some crazy</font>

384
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,959
sophisticated exploit or getting around

385
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,389
your antivirus anything I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> login</font>

386
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">with password one it's great but you</font>

387
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:38,269
have you know this awesome apt

388
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:41,480
prevention tool that's stopping

389
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:45,589
everything else except password one so

390
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,149
again simple stuff basics and so you see

391
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that the focus has</font>

392
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,970
actually been less on security I mean if

393
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,319
you look at what we're implementing I

394
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,899
mean we're implementing all this crazy

395
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:57,019
stuff trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect against like the</font>

396
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">latest apt right and we have less and</font>

397
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,819
less focus on the fundamentals that make

398
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,139
things actually secure and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

399
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:04,189
it don't me wrong it's hard because I

400
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,089
mean you're in a business things are

401
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,349
moving all the time you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

402
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,389
implement things to put things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it's</font>

403
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,129
very difficult it's not an easy task but

404
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,720
in this case it seems like it's less and

405
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,649
less on security and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove you</font>

406
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,089
right now I mean who here feels

407
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:15,290
confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if at school attacker</font>

408
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:20,079
went after your organization that you

409
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:22,998
would either detect it or stop it no one

410
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,829
right now one person in this room that's

411
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:26,569
a problem we're at a point now where

412
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:28,368
that's a problem we should be maturing

413
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:30,139
at a much larger rate to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to at</font>

414
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:32,240
least stop and detect this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

415
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:33,889
saying necessarily prevent it<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100% at</font>

416
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,240
least be able to the stop you know or at

417
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,209
least detect certain things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

418
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,470
happening out there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a problem</font>

419
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,209
so if you look at understanding hacks

420
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,709
really the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> true representation that</font>

421
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,349
we can see of getting hacked ahead of

422
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:48,319
time is either one we get breached right

423
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,610
or two we do a penetration test that's

424
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:51,079
me kind of my focus here talking a

425
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,179
little bit about penetration testing

426
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,378
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good Avenue but</font>

427
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:56,449
it's we're kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> failing at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pen</font>

428
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:58,039
testing at moma too so if you look at

429
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,329
how we can either defend ourselves

430
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,249
against the tax it's either we

431
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:04,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience a breach or we have something</font>

432
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that simulates a breach right and so if</font>

433
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at security in general let me</font>

434
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:10,849
ask a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I'm just in the defense</font>

435
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,989
side are their niches that we have like

436
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,509
different different niches like

437
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:17,299
forensics or you know monitoring

438
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,160
detection or antivirus or you know a

439
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:20,389
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of technology or and then</font>

440
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,829
we also have different incidents out

441
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">there like around audit and everything</font>

442
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,339
else we have different industry niches

443
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:27,049
right same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the pen testing side</font>

444
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,850
right put people focus on web apps

445
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,949
versus mobile hacking versus you know

446
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero day development versus you know red</font>

447
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,618
teaming versus physical versus

448
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:36,559
everything else we have all these

449
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:38,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">different niches that we have I guess in</font>

450
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,809
the security industry right<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

451
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,360
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> an expert at web apps anybody here</font>

452
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:46,368
an expert at pen<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing anyone here an</font>

453
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,549
expert at forensics<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's emitting here</font>

454
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:52,249
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows couple and a couple feels</font>

455
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,869
good so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these different</font>

456
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,459
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then so what happens is we</font>

457
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:57,649
have these different silos that starts

458
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,689
to occur and what I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize</font>

459
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,639
when I did pen testing I could never

460
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:03,498
figure out what happened when I went

461
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,489
into an organization and I destroy them

462
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:06,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">and everyone should perform that next</font>

463
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:08,739
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing and what I</font>

464
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:10,639
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not their job</font>

465
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:12,110
you know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as someone on the</font>

466
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,879
defense's job to understand every single

467
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,119
thing an attacker does it's not another

468
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:19,039
purpose if you like it today<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

469
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:21,169
attacker as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> penta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> straight guys going</font>

470
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,970
in we own a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff right we break</font>

471
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:24,259
into a bunch of things and then we own

472
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,730
some more stuff and both some more stuff

473
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,899
up then we report on all the stuff that

474
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we blow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up and we walk out like whether</font>

475
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,799
they taste like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest day ever</font>

476
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,120
right really<font color="#CCCCCC"> woohoo easier for you know</font>

477
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,970
high five in we know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

478
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,769
whole you know I got

479
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,420
I stole our intellectual<font color="#CCCCCC"> property and</font>

480
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,829
credit cards now they got some defense

481
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,240
like what in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heck am I going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

482
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:43,739
to fix all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's today</font>

483
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,089
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the defense fixes it</font>

484
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,339
technical stuff and then we blow them up

485
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,110
again next time we may do something like

486
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,300
blind or covert testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we still</font>

487
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,189
blow them up right so that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

488
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,959
reaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing pen test build</font>

489
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:57,569
been test build pen test build over and

490
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,878
over again so for me today looking at

491
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:01,378
that personally pen testing and how

492
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,389
we're doing it right now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not working</font>

493
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,680
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just continue to blow stuff up</font>

494
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:06,660
and then fix all then and blow stuff

495
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,800
again it just doesn't work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

496
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason it doesn't work is because we</font>

497
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,670
don't understand what each other is

498
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,509
doing if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the terms</font>

499
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,550
out there you might have heard red

500
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:15,629
teaming you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that or</font>

501
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,099
tractor trying to go more to the

502
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,689
military world<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really what we're</font>

503
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,269
seeing today also is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> vulnerable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t</font>

504
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:22,500
scans and validation and so for me

505
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">personally we need to evolve I know</font>

506
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,829
getting domain admin a sexy for us and

507
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,720
breaking in and hacking into things

508
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:29,339
that's really cool and everything but in

509
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,990
order for us to defend we have to work

510
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,730
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue team which is the people</font>

511
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the defense we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

512
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and learn from each</font>

513
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,050
other I mean I'll be honest when I do a

514
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,240
pen test and I'm sitting in front of

515
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,609
someone the blue team it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

516
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,899
of facetious I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I learned</font>

517
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">so much on how they defend things so I</font>

518
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,079
can break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it even worse but at the same</font>

519
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,910
time they learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I'm breaking in so</font>

520
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,739
they can defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> them against it and so</font>

521
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,319
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we work together it starts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

522
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,879
pretty well and so you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the red</font>

523
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:55,229
team<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a typical walkthrough</font>

524
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,370
I guess of a red team engagement that

525
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,870
that weak division<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's Bob</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font>

526
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,930
congresswoman Edwards that's her yelling

527
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,129
at me at Congress so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just I throw her</font>

528
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,709
into all my slide just to make sure I

529
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,849
can still remember her<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's she's not</font>

530
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,299
mad she's not happy to me at that point

531
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:12,770
I'm like I really messed up one

532
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:14,849
demographic of politics there I guess I

533
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,859
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be unbiased there but</font>

534
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,359
anyways but for the red team<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

535
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,309
assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a pen test company they may</font>

536
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,168
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of assets they might not the</font>

537
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:23,158
security team you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

538
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,390
team usually doesn't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pen</font>

539
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,730
test is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to do the</font>

540
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole covert thing right so you a covert</font>

541
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,450
pentasa detect our monitoring detection

542
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,390
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> instant response and we go in and we</font>

543
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,130
start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what assets they have</font>

544
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,500
no attacks occurred they<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe get Perry</font>

545
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,390
couple min they maybe don't I mean

546
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially what I like to kind of go on</font>

547
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,200
a tangent on really quickly is just ms

548
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,549
ESPYs so you have let me just get this

549
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,380
right so we were at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a point in time</font>

550
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:47,760
where we had monitoring detection

551
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,770
most of them at sea predominantly eighty

552
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,420
ninety percent and then what we did is

553
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,280
we we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving that out to third</font>

554
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,410
parties that handle you know 10,000

555
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,680
20,000 other customers what happens when

556
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,760
you do that does anybody know what

557
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,960
happens when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

558
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,520
you're really familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and you move</font>

559
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,220
it to somebody else that has no idea

560
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,080
what your assets are what happens gets

561
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,940
lost in the noise right so now you might

562
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,740
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up like hey symantec antivirus is</font>

563
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,630
picking up on a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of a</font>

564
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,070
threat which you know AV statistics are

565
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,110
detecting what three to five percent of

566
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,730
malware out there it's great fantastic

567
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,959
so you're detecting three to five

568
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,370
percent of what's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there and</font>

569
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,050
then maybe you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something where case</font>

570
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,100
someone added domain admin to the domain

571
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">damage group and you get an alert on</font>

572
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have all these</font>

573
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,450
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but you've lost the</font>

574
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,889
actualization around where your assets

575
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,470
are and how you actually protect those

576
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,880
assets so we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> get picked up</font>

577
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,340
ninety-nine percent of the time we don't

578
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,510
and then we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take one flaw to break</font>

579
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,919
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire infrastructure so this</font>

580
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,110
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny flaw that you had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its but a</font>

581
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,010
sequel injection or a person or you know

582
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,840
you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something exposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

583
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside you shouldn't have just that one</font>

584
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,709
flaw makes it easy for us to break it

585
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,629
talk about right wrong yeah the blue

586
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,800
team you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on 10 million</font>

587
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,390
projects you're overworked you're

588
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,830
understaffed you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mistake for the entire organization to</font>

590
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,060
come to become a downfall it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

591
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,520
oh wait my job is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest job ever</font>

592
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the defense side I</font>

593
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,690
really feel for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the hardest job</font>

594
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,310
ever dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with patch management I</font>

595
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">rate people i mean like hey we implement</font>

596
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,850
this passionate broke our production

597
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,290
instance now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like six</font>

598
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,820
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to figure out offer a</font>

599
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,379
meeting for meeting to fix a meeting for

600
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,870
another meeting said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't happen</font>

601
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">again right and then you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

602
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,510
monitoring and everything else with the

603
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,190
company it's not possible to be

604
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,629
effective you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at today's</font>

605
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,890
environment it's not possible to read

606
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,480
seen the other for the blue team to be

607
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,890
successful we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always win as a red</font>

608
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
team because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we only need that one</font>

609
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,250
little thing you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten million</font>

610
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">are things again no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here has enough</font>

611
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,030
staffing I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know</font>

612
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,530
another 50 people on my team to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

613
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,450
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle it let me ask another question</font>

614
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,370
from an imbalance perspective you have

615
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,810
IT right aight<font color="#E5E5E5"> see let's just say has</font>

616
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,659
200 people how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people typically</font>

617
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,669
have dedicated security<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that's that's</font>

618
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,140
a good number that's high right it's

619
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,000
like a half a person he's like he's like

620
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,810
the exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> a min and he's like like</font>

621
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,340
two hours a week on security right

622
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,510
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> total imbalance of what we can</font>

623
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,340
actually there are so many moving parts

624
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,658
happening every single day<font color="#CCCCCC"> in technology</font>

625
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,220
inside IT

626
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,450
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

627
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get our hands around everything I</font>

628
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,649
was not possible for you guys to win

629
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,090
right now and so what I'm proposing you

630
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:10,320
know and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other folks have</font>

631
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,759
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in industry is more of a</font>

632
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,200
blended approach where we understand

633
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,269
each other which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purple team and</font>

634
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,979
it's it's a combination of<font color="#CCCCCC"> both</font>

635
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:18,509
defensive and offensive people<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

636
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:20,309
together to really start to understand

637
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:23,249
each other you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in groups that</font>

638
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:25,678
actually have a actually establish red

639
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:27,629
team when they work with the the defense

640
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,159
folks those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand like hey</font>

641
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:30,629
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all I understand what</font>

642
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,249
you did here I can do this the blocking

643
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,869
like some of the coolest you know

644
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:36,210
defensive capabilities are blocking like

645
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:37,470
really stupid stuff you know I learned

646
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">from people that are on the defense love</font>

647
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,769
them because they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> experts in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

648
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:42,509
area if you work together kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of starts</font>

649
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:44,789
to work again so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I initial</font>

650
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">pen test would look like and I was wrong</font>

651
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:47,940
on this by the way I am I was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

652
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:50,639
founders of the the penetration testing

653
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,739
execution standard or pee test and I was

654
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,879
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I said you know when you're</font>

655
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,649
doing Pete<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do penetration</font>

656
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:57,359
testing you have to do blind because you

657
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,518
really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

658
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,349
you have monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> action or incident</font>

659
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,909
response then I realized really quickly

660
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:05,249
that none of us have instant response or

661
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,509
mining detection so what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of</font>

662
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:08,070
doing monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> at section and</font>

663
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:10,739
detecting attacks if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

664
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,029
in place yet you know NM<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSB isn't</font>

665
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:14,279
monitoring detection that's like

666
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:17,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight up antivirus forward like logs</font>

667
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so we have to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

668
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,539
different ways of doing things and to me

669
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:23,609
personally you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be doing a</font>

670
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,019
covert test for like five years you

671
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:26,220
should be focusing on understanding how

672
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,629
an attack actually happens going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

673
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,700
append SS<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually happening in</font>

674
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:31,019
building yourself analytics off of that

675
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,659
and that's what you start to do as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

676
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,220
as detecting attacks and so the purpose

677
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,710
isn't just to focus on like hey you know

678
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">I saw ms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AMSO 80 67 and I'm going to</font>

679
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,460
build a<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to detect that all the</font>

680
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,989
weight still we<font color="#CCCCCC"> still have MS weight or</font>

681
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,190
67 in our environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a still like</font>

682
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:45,899
when we break into a customer and it's

683
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,099
like ms a time like that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest</font>

684
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,959
20 grand I've ever made in my entire

685
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,460
life like thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

686
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,960
I rent two lines and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this and now I</font>

687
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,409
have known<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them it's 106</font>

688
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">Evan so the purpose isn't to say listen</font>

689
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:59,159
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just run a pen test and all</font>

690
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,599
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden now we have these rules that</font>

691
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,519
were going to detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's really a</font>

692
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,009
sale it here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> life cycle of an</font>

693
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual attack here ok this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PHS</font>

694
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:09,479
standard by the way so can I can I can I

695
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:10,979
build defensive capabilities around

696
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:12,149
intelligence gathered so I do

697
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,710
intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering and I say okay</font>

698
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:15,360
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> our PDS have a ton of meh today</font>

699
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,100
metadata in it that enumerate a lot of

700
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,928
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our users or we post</font>

701
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,549
way too much on linkedin who put a

702
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:22,049
policy out in place to restrict access

703
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,100
and monitor that to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

704
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,720
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of information out</font>

705
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,918
there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arlington users or what type</font>

706
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,779
of data we're actually putting on the

707
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,640
internet that from there we start going

708
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the you know identification fate I</font>

709
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,990
start looking at a little you know super

710
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple things that we can start to get</font>

711
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,950
rid of like let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me ask an example here</font>

712
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,779
if I if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what my ports and</font>

713
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,990
protocols are on my outside internet

714
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,580
let's just say I only allow 8443 2553

715
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,679
and that's it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have four courses I</font>

716
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,360
allowing the outside if anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> touches</font>

717
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,919
me on any other poor why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

718
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,990
ban them for like a few weeks or a

719
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,700
couple days or a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours it's</font>

720
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,380
simple right what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

721
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does just by banning</font>

722
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,149
those like small portions of people that

723
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,260
are trying to reports can you it

724
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:03,330
literally eliminates like eighty percent

725
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,620
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise so now you're only focusing</font>

726
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,720
on twenty percent a little bit more

727
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,820
easier and manageable some<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples</font>

728
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">courts can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web scans things that can be</font>

729
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily mapped or automatically blocked</font>

730
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,529
those are simple things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do and</font>

731
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,750
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to like the exploitation</font>

732
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,919
phase or post exploitation it do things

733
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do as an attacker all</font>

734
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,260
the time you start to build that out and

735
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,158
now you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font>

736
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,470
things that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be a</font>

737
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,730
plausible from attacker perspective but

738
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can remove the noise and focus on five</font>

739
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,419
percent or ten percent or fifty percent

740
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:29,820
that's really what matters I get depot

741
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:31,350
for example at DB port scan does<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

742
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">organ art which we had you know we're in</font>

743
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:36,959
over 77 countries 30,000 employees and

744
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,309
so what would happen is if you port scan

745
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,409
is anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our entire external</font>

746
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,059
presence and across our entire or all of

747
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:43,799
our country space it would ban you

748
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,750
across our entire globe for about six

749
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:47,700
days then after that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

750
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,289
automatically you know uh none<font color="#CCCCCC"> Banyon</font>

751
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">than v-band again at block e for 12 days</font>

752
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:53,190
nobody increment<font color="#CCCCCC"> by two times each time</font>

753
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,779
and what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that is we</font>

754
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,919
literally eliminate it like eighty

755
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:56,909
percent of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had to deal with and</font>

756
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,169
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there we start moving on to</font>

757
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:59,309
web applications and then once we had

758
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:01,110
web applications down we started

759
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,399
automatically blocking on those not only

760
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">had like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent the noise I got to</font>

761
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,699
the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you know you're really</font>

762
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,719
only focusing on a small fraction of

763
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,679
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually happening on the</font>

764
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,270
perimeter which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be your</font>

765
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,230
highest attacked area right and from

766
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,460
there moving more tortured user

767
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,950
population and technique things like

768
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,409
that so when we looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted</font>

769
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,809
a funny story I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a meeting one</font>

770
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:20,549
time and I get this text message<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

771
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:22,230
was like the Darth Vader sound when we

772
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,720
got attacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was government heard</font>

773
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,520
but so we get the Darth Vader sound and

774
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,149
I get a look at it and it automatically

775
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,739
sent me a

776
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:30,718
message with you know who the attacker

777
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,799
was the geolocation of it you know

778
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether what they're trying to do in</font>

779
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,830
kind of like the actual dump of what

780
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:37,139
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this guy was trying to</font>

781
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,389
hit us with sequel injection on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

782
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:41,039
website which we weren't worried about

783
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:42,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the when the geolocation was coming</font>

784
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a panera bread like two minutes</font>

785
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,690
down the road so I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

786
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,799
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

787
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,690
we had like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me like some people</font>

788
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,700
in a car we're all packed into like this

789
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,929
Honda Civic I had at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

790
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">look we're locked all sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of</font>

791
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:54,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other earlier you throw to beat</font>

792
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:56,549
this guy up you know later on I'm like

793
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:58,049
playing some heavy metal music you know

794
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,839
to get us ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go when we get into</font>

795
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:02,580
there so we walk out to the we walking

796
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">against the panera bread and we're like</font>

797
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:09,418
that's the guy what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do I don't</font>

798
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:12,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like six cubes give me sir Sir are</font>

799
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:14,849
you hacking are no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay thank you</font>

800
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">every day you know no but uh we did get</font>

801
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,519
some surveillance view from panera we

802
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,389
actually gave it to the FBI<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

803
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,339
wouldn't not going to store kind of

804
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:21,478
scare them a little bit but you know

805
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:22,649
those are cool things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to do when</font>

806
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,950
you actually said to detect things right

807
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:27,059
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just simple stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that how many</font>

808
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,330
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are blocking simple stuff</font>

809
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:33,299
just blocking simple stuff one two hands

810
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,710
it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a couple people so we're</font>

811
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,210
gonna play a little game i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

812
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you to live demonstrations and</font>

813
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,989
these demonstrations the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like</font>

814
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,190
showing them is because it really really

815
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:42,359
defeats pretty much all your technology

816
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,830
to have out there and if you don't have

817
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,609
a program in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place then your</font>

818
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,779
technologies i can make a difference

819
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,849
when you're coming to these two attacks

820
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,589
literally like they're like you could

821
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:51,299
have every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single piece of awesome</font>

822
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,289
technology in the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and all</font>

823
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are gonna get around them it's</font>

824
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:55,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">just fantastic like application</font>

825
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:58,019
whitelisting still don't understand what

826
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is to this day let me just question</font>

827
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,649
the application whitelisting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was the</font>

828
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,089
big buzz for a couple years right so you

829
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:04,709
put application whitelisting on all your

830
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,969
endpoints right to protect your users

831
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,799
and stuff like that and maybe

832
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:10,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">point-of-sale systems and everything as</font>

833
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:13,589
an attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack certain</font>

834
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,789
applications right and that's that's how

835
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">i get access to your computer right so</font>

836
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go out for job or I'm going</font>

837
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,928
up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adobe amigo up there IE or</font>

838
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:21,359
whatever the ends up being as an exploit

839
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:24,779
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i exploit that user what am i</font>

840
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:27,599
running under debt whitelisted

841
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:29,279
application when i'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test a</font>

842
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,509
lot of times like hated did you see our

843
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,190
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> while this singsong I'm like</font>

844
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:34,200
oh you guys had application whitelisting

845
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,969
softer I'm like oh I did I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

846
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,879
it was hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just didn't</font>

847
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">even know tit I mean yeah it was good we</font>

848
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,250
don't have to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> our technique for</font>

849
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,199
that

850
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,850
so that what you're going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here a</font>

851
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,230
couple of the attacks one of them is I'm

852
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,179
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> defeat the hover on this is</font>

853
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,500
more on education awareness if you know

854
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,850
how we tell our users you know you hover

855
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,040
over the link to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

856
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,179
legit and everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the URLs get</font>

857
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,490
then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on everything's good</font>

858
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,420
right so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defeat that and</font>

859
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,370
then the second one we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

860
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,860
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an actual attack where</font>

861
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,120
it goes against Java but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not an</font>

862
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,800
actual exploit so you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

863
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,360
fully like latest the greatest updated

864
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java that you want to and it still gets</font>

865
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,060
around everything and it exploits your

866
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,429
computer doesn't trigger any antivirus

867
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,720
or heuristics or behavioral analysis or

868
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,220
next generation stuff it's premature

869
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:22,160
gets thrown mall which is good news for

870
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:23,960
us so I'll do the hover first so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

871
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the social engineer toolkit and this is</font>

872
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,260
the newest<font color="#CCCCCC"> version it came out I don't</font>

873
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,660
know well I released a new version like

874
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,760
two days ago but I released version 6

875
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,260
like about a month ago or so and it has

876
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,820
a lot a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of new attack vectors that</font>

877
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,650
make it much easier for you to get

878
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">access into an organization and the</font>

879
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,950
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this tool was really to show</font>

880
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,060
education awareness and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective</font>

881
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,800
you are defending against these type of

882
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,750
things so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the social</font>

883
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,860
engineer toolkit I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go to the</font>

884
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,470
social engineering attacks which is

885
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,729
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and we go to the website</font>

886
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,180
attack vector which is number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 i'm</font>

887
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the web jacking method</font>

888
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,930
which is number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 i'm just going to go</font>

889
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and clone a website real quick and i'll</font>

890
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">just do something like gmail because it</font>

891
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:04,670
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> username password in so you can</font>

892
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,199
see it kind of the full impact so I'm a

893
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:13,040
clone gmail real quick which is really

894
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">accounts like google com and what's done</font>

895
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,430
cloning

896
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,860
there we go we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do them to go</font>

897
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to my Windows 8 machine here and this</font>

898
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,939
works on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows 8 Windows 7 OS X</font>

899
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,179
whatever you want does make a difference

900
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,519
chrome firefox that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing like</font>

901
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:31,899
we can take advantage of browser flaws

902
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:33,399
without actually having to like curry

903
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:36,549
like a zero-day or an exploit those get

904
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:43,918
burnt pretty quickly yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> bama's working</font>

905
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:43,918
out 6145 my page here real quick

906
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what I would typically do here</font>

907
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,980
is I you know I go after an organization

908
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,720
let's just say it's trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> sec and my</font>

909
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,070
favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones are like benefits websites</font>

910
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,840
because usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> outsource those or third</font>

911
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,668
parties but doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter just find</font>

912
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,600
something that's externally exposed and

913
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,919
what I'll do is I'll create a website

914
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,408
that looks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> believable in every way</font>

915
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,030
so like it mimics your externally facing

916
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,830
website and everything right and I'll

917
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,059
tell users I'm like make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hover</font>

918
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,649
over this link to make sure it's a

919
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:16,120
legitimate account and so let's just a

920
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,770
i'm going to do like benefits trust it's

921
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,899
a calm when you hover over this link it

922
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,889
will save benefits trust etsy com when

923
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,659
you hover over and you look at it's

924
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,490
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I normally make</font>

925
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:25,809
a nice little website<font color="#CCCCCC"> this just demo now</font>

926
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,130
in a hover over this link what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

927
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">say on the bottom left you can you see</font>

928
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:32,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in the bottom left those at</font>

929
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,850
can't see it it says HTTPS colon forward

930
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,490
slash accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doc's google.com no</font>

931
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,860
trickery here right so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

932
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,799
own domain right so that's legit right

933
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:47,439
so it's safe I really on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's doing</font>

934
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,610
something weird here so before I you

935
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,289
know you got on the stage today would

936
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,080
you think that and your browser that's

937
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,760
safe that's good to go right so what

938
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,720
happens when you click this is you're

939
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,919
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my computer is</font>

940
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,179
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accounts like</font>

941
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,470
Google to calm them physically<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font>

942
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,640
there in a revision performed like you

943
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,020
know there's me packets exchange with

944
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the server and everything let I'm gonna</font>

945
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a quick switcheroo without using a</font>

946
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,460
user interaction and we're gonna steal

947

<font color="#E5E5E5">the using a password right so watch no</font>

948
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,020
hands right so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> add that counts</font>

949
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:17,979
that Google to come see that quick

950
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:20,190
switcheroo here's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> username this is my</font>

951
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,190
password

952
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,820
you see here we're get are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">email and password here so we're able to</font>

955
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,020
defeat the hovering right let's book

956
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,340
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we teach all of our users</font>

957
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,500
right hover you're good to go you're

958
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,060
safe it's perfectly fine right we as

959
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,380
attackers know that we take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

960
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,790
it like you can get anybody do anything

961
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want you like my favorite are like</font>

962
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,700
getting like<font color="#E5E5E5"> like mail system like you</font>

963
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,830
know they're just sing a handwritten

964
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,450
letter you can be like hey this is

965
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,590
so-and-so from IT I need you to plug

966
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,750
this in disable your antivirus

967
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,800
double-click the CXC and then when you

968
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,690
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pop-up it says it's still</font>

969
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,190
malicious and allow to make sure and the

970
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">blade cool came from someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like in the</font>

971
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,920
mail is from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> company it's got to be</font>

972
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,050
legit like you can get people do

973
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,790
anything you want to and it's great

974
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,960
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack is it takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage</font>

975
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,950
of what we're taught in education

976
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,690
awareness so that's a pretty pretty

977
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,660
horrible one and you feel a bit bad

978
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,210
about that actually so next one is the

979
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Java applet attack and the Java applet</font>

980
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,200
attack for me is perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> because Java is</font>

981
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,000
like literally the most attacked surface

982
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,220
period like<font color="#E5E5E5"> when someone has job and</font>

983
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff we love you it's easier it's like</font>

984
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,270
I'm actually if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java and you're</font>

985
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,910
using anything above windows XP we love

986
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,840
you even more because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't even</font>

987
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,340
noticed or not but if when you went to

988
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,600
from you know like we moved off with

989
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,459
windows XP because it was end of life

990
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,110
when you moved off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XP you</font>

991
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,370
gave us so many more attack vectors with

992
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,889
like Windows Vista and Windows 7 Windows

993
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,739
8 it's so beautiful like<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell oh</font>

994
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,060
my god like we love it like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font>

995
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,050
you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell there it's like the</font>

996
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,010
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that has ever</font>

997
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,050
happened to us like we can do anything

998
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:47,770
we want to like it's magic it's magic

999
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:55,629
for hackers so in this case we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1000
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do Java anybody here still using</font>

1001
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:03,970
windows XP by the way much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

1002
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:05,290
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no remember and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

1003
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,580
do is I'm a clone rustic my comment

1004
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,470
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can clone any website I want to</font>

1005
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,300
i'm just going to use trusted second as

1006
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,700
an example and what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it'll</font>

1007
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,159
automatically take everything for me

1008
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,080
inject it and it does everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in</font>

1009
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,190
what's called a es it's an aes encrypted

1010
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,020
bubble so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like everything that's</font>

1011
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,920
done is all done via<font color="#CCCCCC"> the advanced</font>

1012
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,900
encryption standard so it's all

1013
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,700
encrypted polymorphic changes every

1014
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,080
single time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to worry</font>

1015
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,760
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting picked up by anything and</font>

1016
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,460
what's even better about this attack

1017
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,750
here is it never touches<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk so we're</font>

1018
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">not like writing anything to a file</font>

1019
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,650
we're not like dropping an executable

1020
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,470
we're literally using everything how job

1021
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:49,580
and windows were just

1022
00:32:36,470 --> 00:33:03,169
it's beautiful hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a all</font>

1023
00:32:49,580 --> 00:33:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">right 134 so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1024
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:06,350
looks legit and everybody should perform

1025
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,460
and what you can do it with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

1026
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:12,080
applet oh wait I've used that before no

1027
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,480
contest if people still click run like

1028
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,039
it's ridiculous like you can put like

1029
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:25,340
this is malicious in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise your</font>

1030
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:27,020
computer nib like so in this case we can

1031
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,428
make the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything we want to and</font>

1032
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,650
what's great about the publisher feel

1033
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:31,789
like I love that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these code</font>

1034
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,740
signing shirts that are supposed to be

1035
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:35,330
like uber secure so you can register

1036
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's called a DB air doing business as</font>

1037
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,689
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 bucks and if we can go by a</font>

1038
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,490
code signing shirts so like I own like

1039
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,440
verified publisher this publisher is

1040
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,000
secure like you can do anything you want

1041
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,770
to you there<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is cool you know a</font>

1042
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,630
make whatever you want to like I mean

1043
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,679
and make that your code signing certain

1044
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's legitimate as far as Adobe's</font>

1045
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,210
concern so for a user population would

1046
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,940
everybody click that even if it's a goat

1047
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,580
spa I don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can even put in your</font>

1048
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,750
email like hey as part of this you're

1049
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get this pop-up it says goats</font>

1050
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,919
baje click run they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a cool sounds</font>

1051
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:08,960
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna say anything you're good</font>

1052
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,310
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit run and what it does after</font>

1053
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,580
that is once it executes and this is

1054
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just an SSL warning here not something</font>

1055
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:17,000
what it does here is it redirects back

1056
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,199
to the legitimate trusted sec website so

1057
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">you never knew your at the malicious web</font>

1058
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,649
sign the first place which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

1059
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:24,310
right and over here we have full access

1060
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:24,310
to the computer

1061
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,109
there we go so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have relax is that</font>

1062
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,210
person's computer and that was easy and

1063
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,100
by the way it's so again memory resident

1064
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,659
it hooks<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your proxy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> settings so if</font>

1065
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,790
you're using something like a like a web

1066
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,379
blocker likes can save for blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> coat or</font>

1067
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever hooks into those settings and</font>

1068
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,460
then the proxies itself out over HTTP

1069
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,570
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> https goes perfect and then we have</font>

1070
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:52,030
communication back and forth and take

1071
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:54,070
your network so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play a</font>

1072
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,659
little game<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one minute is going to</font>

1073
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,330
give you multiple choice with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ABC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

1074
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you can pick multiple you know</font>

1075
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,210
letters<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever but let me know</font>

1076
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,290
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of</font>

1077
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,430
preventing these attacks because we're

1078
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a Red Team Blue team ran just</font>

1079
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,830
showed you how I can destroy<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1080
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,259
network and we going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

1081
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,619
we can defend against it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

1082
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,619
first one

1083
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,770
which one<font color="#E5E5E5"> a be seeing the alia Bhatt's</font>

1084
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,510
right as correct sir but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

1085
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,680
that's not necessarily you know one

1086
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,880
hundred percent actress we can't

1087
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,680
necessarily a remove job in our

1088
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,600
environments which is unfortunate so

1089
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:40,919
let's do for real scenario want the

1090
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:43,350
applet ABC or d all the above very good

1091
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes so there's two things that make most</font>

1092
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,180
malware almost ineffective and that's

1093
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,040
disabling Xing any type of exe execution

1094
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,690
inside the temp directory on sir your

1095
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">User Profile to a temp directory and all</font>

1096
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,270
user profiles you literally like to

1097
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,530
eliminate those two and eliminate like

1098
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy eighty percent of Mallory out</font>

1099
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,650
there that's where they all run from so

1100
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do those two that's easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

1101
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,070
gonna stop set necessarily did you know

1102
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,300
you actually have application

1103
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,460
whitelisting built in the group policy

1104
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,470
right now I think called a blocker or

1105
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,030
software restriction policies so you

1106
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,799
have that built into group policy right

1107
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,420
now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your environment and what you can</font>

1108
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,770
do is inside of a blocker there's a

1109
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,960
there's a check mark that you can do

1110
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,940
saying disallow powershell<font color="#CCCCCC"> for regular</font>

1111
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,430
users regularly these you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should never</font>

1112
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,050
be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell right no reason for</font>

1113
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to boom now all of a sudden you</font>

1114
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop how I do my PowerShell injection</font>

1115
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
technique and set that was just like a

1116
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,470
click of a button shouldn't impact your

1117
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,520
user population by the way everybody is

1118
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,779
moving to power so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1119
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so that's probably a good one to do</font>

1120
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,540
like all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the hacking community</font>

1121
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,759
all use<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell no matter what like</font>

1122
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's beautiful for us like even if you</font>

1123
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,180
have what are called execution

1124
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,830
restriction policies we can circumvent

1125
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,750
bypass those no problem it's like this

1126
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,480
trivial so you have to worry about that

1127
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:48,240
as an attacker so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommend that as</font>

1128
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,950
well remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java or security I believe</font>

1129
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,569
Rob Fuller's gonna be giving a talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1130
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,890
little bit later today where he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple really good techniques about how</font>

1132
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,310
to disable and stop java applet so

1133
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,960
definitely give him a check if you get a

1134
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance he's got some good techniques on</font>

1135
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,650
on securing<font color="#CCCCCC"> java and disallowing a lot</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things at the proxy so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a b c and d</font>

1137
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:11,070
for reals nothing's bulletproof<font color="#CCCCCC"> i showed</font>

1138
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,110
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of getting around soft</font>

1139
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,810
restriction policies and execution

1140
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,710
research and policy sorry and also

1141
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,540
showed a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of getting around</font>

1142
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">powershell on injection techniques if</font>

1143
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're disabling it again nothing's</font>

1144
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,140
bulletproof but definitely makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

1145
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,150
lot harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to do it as an</font>

1146
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,470
attacker that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a quick proof of</font>

1147
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,599
concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did it getting around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apple</font>

1148
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,000
curr one of my favorites is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I released a</font>

1149
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,320
tool called magic unicorn and what it

1150
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,510
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it basically generates</font>

1151
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,280
metasploit shellcode for you and it's

1152
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">not based off of all if your motive</font>

1153
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,430
matthew gray / it's based off of his

1154
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,040
attack what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually takes</font>

1155
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,149
shellcode and when you compromise the

1156
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,650
machining you run a power shift mean

1157
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,640
it's literally a copy and paste of a

1158
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,590
command<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can show you real quick</font>

1159
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,430
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I'll show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real quick</font>

1160
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,840
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say I have access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1161
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:53,040
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I have the ability to use</font>

1162
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,170
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> execution some way it's gonna be</font>

1163
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,080
under unicorn so literally this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

1164
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:04,230
open source tool and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1165
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:06,779
Windows meterpreter reverse TCP in my IP

1166
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:11,220
address is when I to 168 camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> or IP</font>

1167
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,480
addresses for nothing 134 145 I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

1168
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,950
do over 443 it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> generate</font>

1169
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,420
everything for me and literally it's an

1170
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,710
encoded string that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just paste into</font>

1171
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,710
your Windows environment you get a shell

1172
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,609
so we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let me get that</font>

1173
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,810
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the command right here you</font>

1174
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:39,200
can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to copy and</font>

1175
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:47,570
paste this over this environment here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1176
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:48,649
should have it running over here yeah so

1177
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the command here literally see</font>

1178
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's I'm just copying pasting it into a</font>

1179
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:58,790
command prompt right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I pasted this I get</font>

1180
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,170
my shell over here in a second it's like

1181
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,940
that easy of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell it's awesome</font>

1182
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,870
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disk which is the</font>

1183
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,010
greatest part about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you're not</font>

1184
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're clearly memory resident</font>

1185
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,130
everything have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about getting</font>

1186
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,410
detected by anything so that's an easy

1187
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,480
one most recently in the toolkit I added

1188
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,190
the ability to do powershell injections

1189
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,900
for Microsoft sequel so you can actually

1190
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft sequel as an entry point</font>

1191
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,630
to call your power<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell code and then</font>

1192
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,640
it compromises the Machine through

1193
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:22,730
Microsoft sequel so some easy ways of

1194
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,129
doing that too so web jacking that's the

1195
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,300
first one you saw which was you know

1196
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,500
basically being able to defeat power

1197
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,540
this one's tough because of targets

1198
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:40,580
education awareness so what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1199
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:47,029
say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> B C or D for the web jacking</font>

1200
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:49,220
attacked hover when I hover over for me

1201
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,270
it's a B and C and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in the reason</font>

1202
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,859
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not from your</font>

1203
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,090
uncategorised sites if you're using

1204
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,560
anything like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluecoat askance if they</font>

1205
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,510
have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what's called</font>

1206
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">uncategorised and they some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

1207
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,710
named differently but I'm categorize

1208
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,120
sites literally can<font color="#E5E5E5"> will never in most</font>

1209
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases won't impact your business because</font>

1210
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">most sites are categorized and already</font>

1211
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,880
have been classified in every way most

1212
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,800
phishing sites you are uncategorised

1213
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,270
they don't spend the time to submit to

1214
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so you make this check mark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yielded</font>

1217
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,150
out there which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good what's</font>

1218
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">funny though in order to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> registered</font>

00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,840
as a category<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said the glitter you can</font>

1220
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,830
clone one of the Michigan<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font>

1221
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,810
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention which one this is but</font>

1222
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,670
literally you can cologne the content

1223
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,230
filtering I'm company's own website and

1224
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,120
then submit it for classification and it

1225
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,250
submits it classifies you as a content

1226
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,720
filtering compliment it's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1227
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,070
it's not hard to get around but most of

1228
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,810
hackers don't spend the time to actually

1229
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,310
categorize your site so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to have a</font>

1230
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,600
sentence like categorize me as<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

1231
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,950
I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I submitted to it and</font>

1232
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,770
then it checks and make sure it's legit

1233
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,089
and you're set some technology control

1234
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,720
could possibly do it like call-outs the

1235
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,610
militias idea

1236
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,810
dresses personally for me it's education

1237
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,150
awareness of teaching their users or

1238
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,430
look for weird things some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1239
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:54,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can look for educational furnace</font>

1240
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,790
one two factor authentication I love

1241
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-factor authentication because we</font>

1242
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:59,390
most of the time implemented in a very

1243
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,310
bad way<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for example phone factors</font>

1244
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,870
my favorite to go around like the past

1245
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:05,330
seven and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tessa been on phone factor</font>

1246
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,160
hasn't stopped me<font color="#E5E5E5"> once not once and</font>

1247
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:09,049
what's great about phone factor is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we</font>

1248
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,330
put the error back into the human again

1249
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,070
let me ask an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1250
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,150
say I get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cork Reds right I harvest</font>

somewhere I'm sure quick sure cool this

1265
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,759
happened like Boop cool i'll set think

1266
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,810
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool because i got under my</font>

1267
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,460
credential and it's like oh you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1268

be validated with phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm like oh</font>

1270
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,470
and i'm logged in it's great so you

1271
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,760
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't worry about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that type of</font>

1272
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,259
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we have to make</font>

1273
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,790
sure you a plant to factor you're taking

1274
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,960
the air out of the human of today's

1275
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,930
software getting in with simple stuff

1276
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,340
and kind uncategorized sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> um one of</font>

1277
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,480
my favorite tools out there right now is

1278
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,860
what we call the enhancement again

1279
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,110
experience to open em it as anybody

1280
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,270
heard of em met before that's great

1281
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's huge if you haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1282
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,130
it definitely write it down it's a free

1283
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:15,050
tool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft and literally what it</font>

1284
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,940
does is it stops the majority of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

1285
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,320
days out there and exploits zoom you're

1286
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,790
running like Windows XP service pack 2

1287
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,590
and you have em in install you're

1288
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,150
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for a little while now</font>

1289
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:26,210
there's a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bypass techniques</font>

1290
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,980
for Emmet Jared de menthe<font color="#CCCCCC"> adan some</font>

1291
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,910
research from bromium and basically

1292
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,170
showed how you can bypass all the

1293
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,330
mitigation techniques with Emmet and

1294
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,860
fairly easily but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no exploits we're in</font>

1295
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,390
our utilizing and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely better</font>

1296
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,380
to have that on than not it's really

1297
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,089
easy to install I mean I'm go me

1298
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,320
rephrase it it's extremely complicated

1299
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,790
to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have to double</font>

1300
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,110
click the MS sign you have hit next like

1301
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,660
four times if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had of three times</font>

1302
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:46,400
it'll been<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but the fourth time is a</font>

1303
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,660
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit overkill and then after that</font>

1304
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,220
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> em</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> installed and you pretty</font>

1305
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,600
much ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go couple configuration</font>

1306
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,950
settings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd probably change but</font>

1307
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,390
literally it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and profiles how</font>

1308
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,160
attackers think like for example if I'm

1309
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,540
developing an exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use what's</font>

1310
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,920
called return oriented programming our

00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">rock gadgets north</font>

1312
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,000
to circumvent some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> preventive</font>

1313
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,460
measures like data execution prevention

1314
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,200
or a SLR or<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep protections things like</font>

1315
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,760
data time memory what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> does is it</font>

1316
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,078
profiles how I think as an attacker and

1317
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,059
stops them it doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1318
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,710
major impact on on your performance it's

1319
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:14,990
really small and lightweight they've

1320
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">done a really good job just as an</font>

1321
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,200
example a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a couple weeks ago</font>

1322
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,000
there's a zero-day OS released for

1323
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,770
internet explorer and the exploit

1324
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,079
actually checked for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> emmett dll and</font>

1325
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,130
if the MF dll was there just died it

1326
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:32,150
wouldn't actually run the exploit code

1327
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:33,380
pretty cool so for actually detecting it

1328
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,450
taxes is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the snare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did but</font>

1329
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,220
for actually detecting attacks what's

1330
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:39,169
the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> method for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually detecting</font>

1331
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:48,169
attacks a B C or D like a taxing

1332
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:51,799
organization B and<font color="#E5E5E5"> C yes sir you got it</font>

1333
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,819
B<font color="#E5E5E5"> and C so B and C are my two most</font>

1334
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:54,140
preferred method you actually have to

1335
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:55,940
build a monitoring program and if you

1336
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,940
augment that with other people like an

1337
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,140
MSP to do 24 by 7 fantastic you have to

1338
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,599
have a program in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place first like hey</font>

1339
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,980
here's my assets here's what I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1340
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,020
monitor on that here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

1341
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,520
applications here's my external presence

1342
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,200
here is my user population how do I map

1343
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,309
all that I look at data then from there

1344
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,520
do some purple teaming and learn what

1345
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:14,869
you're actually doing that works thought

1346
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,130
I fool you guys to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the head you know the</font>

1347
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:20,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">next generation of the card on there</font>

1348
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:21,680
figured you pick a too smart so for me

1349
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:23,480
you know the blue team is often not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1350
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,098
sexy one right blue team is often like

1351
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,420
the guys that have to sit there and

1352
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:28,099
defend all day long and the red<font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

1353
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,990
goes in and smash stuff off to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1354
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:31,790
the purple team is awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sexy</font>

1355
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,078
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get to work together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1356
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,190
figure out ways of<font color="#E5E5E5"> better defending and</font>

1357
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:35,359
plus you get the blow stuff up and learn

1358
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:37,549
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hack and we get to learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

1359
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,569
defend it works really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well companies</font>

1360
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are actually doing this right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1361
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:42,049
it's significantly harder for us to

1362
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,640
break it<font color="#CCCCCC"> guarantee there's a company</font>

1363
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:45,740
that took this concept from one of the

1364
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,730
talks that gave a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back when</font>

1365
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purple team for the</font>

1366
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,970
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time just kind of blatantly and</font>

1367
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">they went and started implementing that</font>

1368
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:55,640
in their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much harder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1369
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,020
us to actually get into so for me going

1370
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">into an organization like depot for</font>

1371
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,710
example is anybody can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do imagine what</font>

1372
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,569
my mom was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kind of get the idea</font>

1373
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,160
there is when I became<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chief</font>

1374
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:05,750
security officer<font color="#E5E5E5"> over Deebo what was the</font>

1375
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,460
first thing that I did for the

1376
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,359
organization what was the first thing I

1377
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:15,150
did the first program I established

1378
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,190
not the purple team education awareness

1379
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,809
right that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing I</font>

1380
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,950
established very first thing I didn't do

00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Boland brain management I didn't get a</font>

1383
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do whatever I focus on education</font>

1384
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,119
awareness and the reason for that is

1385
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">because once you change the culture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people and they understand why</font>

00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,049
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can relate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1388
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,549
them like hey here's how you protect

1389
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:33,839
your home facebook account or your home

1390
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:35,910
wireless people by way people don't care

1391
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the company data at all if you can</font>

1393
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,990
about their home stuff will actually

1394
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:42,240
like at least care a little bit that's

1395
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,549
what you're hoping for for me education

1396
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,959
awareness was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> was perfect but what I</font>

1397
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:47,940
also did is I focused on education

1398
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,109
awareness with our IT staff<font color="#CCCCCC"> like getting</font>

1399
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,700
them to understand security what we're

1400
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:53,009
doing on working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them I was funny</font>

1401
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,240
they had a running<font color="#E5E5E5"> joke so they every</font>

1402
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,740
every week they'd have like you know

1403
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,479
that IT meeting it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like their change</font>

1404
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,740
control board and they would show you

1405
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,930
know they started implementing like

1406
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,848
threats the organization and things like

1407
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,990
that I was the number one threat on in

1408
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:06,270
the organization for like six months

1409
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,379
running so like dip Dave's the number

1410
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,059
one thread again<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's go the</font>

1411
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,290
next thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but you know keeping</font>

1412
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:11,970
it on their minds and fresh and things

1413
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,140
like that was huge and what we started

1414
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,180
happening is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more by off and what</font>

1415
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,770
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing for security and so for me</font>

1416
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">personally you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build this</font>

1417
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,259
and you're gonna look at what you need

1418
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,640
to do to build these type of things in

1419
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,380
your environment of coming up with

1420
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,549
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels of maturity I call them</font>

1421
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,559
breach readiness being come whenever you

1422
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:26,700
want to know level one is your basic

1423
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,780
level this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like your ham</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1424
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,970
starting off and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we're at</font>

1425
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,010
today as an industry just stopping the

1426
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:33,569
basic stuff like pork scans automated

1427
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,619
vulnerability scans Nick to whip do

1428
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:36,150
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1429
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,500
be very common basic out there that are

1430
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna literally eliminate eighty percent</font>

1431
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,950
of the script kiddies out there okay and

1432
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,660
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that you have to</font>

1433
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,879
understand your baseline of your

1434
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,170
external assets first what your ports<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1435
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocols are reversions they are stuff</font>

1436
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,790
like that then from there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> start the</font>

1437
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,379
program profile web applications and

1438
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">baseline normal traffic then so we're</font>

1439
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,200
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on things like egress filtering</font>

1440
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:57,150
our outbound traffic you really start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1441
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,490
prevent outside communications and

1442
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,380
locking those down significantly level

1443
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">three make it more difficult to pivot</font>

1444
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,400
from a post exploitation page like for

1445
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">example if I break into one system this</font>

1446
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,790
you know I extract the local admin hash

1447
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,529
so those local admin hash is typically

1448
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,029
the same and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other systems yes</font>

1449
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,559
so it's easy for me to leap frogged

1450
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,020
other systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> or pivot other systems or</font>

1451
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:17,730
that user account has access into<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

1452
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy and I can extract the clear text</font>

1453
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,250
admin hash from that or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ends</font>

1454
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,290
up being so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of methods</font>

1455
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we use stop those again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your when</font>

1456
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,349
we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know those</font>

1457
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,270
how we attack as an attacker well before

1458
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:29,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">test the effectiveness of all of your</font>

1459
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">other levels so you've gotten to level 4</font>

1460
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:32,290
which is great and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

1461
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,759
sure it actually works you know many

1462
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">times I go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into an organization that has</font>

1463
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,910
like hey we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trigger if you</font>

1464
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:38,260
add a domain admin and like you've

1465
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,430
already like compromising that's like

1466
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,200
friday and like hey we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave</font>

1467
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:44,500
so we'll add a domain name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a</font>

1468
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,210
domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> ammons I crickets feel like they</font>

1469
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,030
should have said something I know why

1470
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,900
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working right now it's weird we</font>

1471
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,930
wait a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 more minutes</font>

1472
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,820
nothing we leave and everything like oh

1473
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,890
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had an issue where when we</font>

1474
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,180
upgraded from 2003-2008 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs</font>

00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rule didn't work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore so we've</font>

1477
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,710
been going you know two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

1478
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:05,010
having detection on this whatsoever kind

00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">of tests that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff it's got to work</font>

1480
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,470
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> five this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is when you start getting</font>

1481
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,299
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey I can start to develop you</font>

1482
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the x0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day protection start to look</font>

1483
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,599
at like assets and getting down more to

1484
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,410
isolation of zones and high security

1485
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,030
zones good stuff level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 congratulations</font>

1486
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,230
covert testing time now this is when we

1487
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,190
can start going to covert testing we're

1488
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,990
like hey we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to test you</font>

1489
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,280
from an attacker perspective it can you

1490
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:26,828
actually detect and prevent a lobby

1491
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,020
attacks were going through so wrapping

1492
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:30,849
things up we are getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

1493
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,109
securities in the news it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

of directors not everything is bad in

00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,890
about it by thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was awesome like</font>

1503
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:46,390
we came out in full force like all the

1504
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,859
vendors have hatches in like one day

1505
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,779
people were responding to innocently

1506
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:51,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">what sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what are we vulnerable</font>

on people running scanners are checking

websites i mean hell it was cool and

1509
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,500
that was all over the media news we were

1510
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:58,029
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> men you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep doing stuff</font>

1511
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,589
like that and capitalize on then keep

1512
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,970
using it hookers like 10 more<font color="#CCCCCC"> heart</font>

00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:05,078
plays this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm hoping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for it like</font>

1514
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:07,328
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sweet keep it going and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw</font>

you know target<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIO get get nailed yet</font>

1516
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:11,260

1517
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:12,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean obviously the other other things</font>

1518
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,230
are happening till I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can identify our</font>

1519
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,650
stuff but<font color="#CCCCCC"> so first time we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a CIO</font>

1520
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:20,339
and a CEO basically nixed for an s

1521
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:22,329
pacific reach so good stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

1522
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,500
but we have to get better<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean and</font>

1523
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:24,940
attacks are going to magically stop

1524
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,380
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to get more and</font>

1525
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,730
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophisticated as we go along so we</font>

1526
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,960
have they like at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up to this</font>

1527
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,829
point in time so where we can stop

1528
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,950
against the stuff that's going to happen

1529
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:35,280
in the future so for me personally build

1530
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,759
a purple team<font color="#CCCCCC"> employ hackers good ones i</font>

1531
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,770

00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,650
understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> your infrastructure</font>

1534
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,140
knowledge and having folks that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1535
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:46,780
the same team to defend its awesome not

1536
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,910
get any better than that and until we

1537
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,890
train hard this is a quote that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

1538
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,629
to say a lot of times because I look at

1539
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:56,200
our military is our military know how to

1540
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:59,200
fight do they practice how to fight they

1541
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,730
practice how to defend right do we do

1542
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,870
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we like when I was in the</font>

1543
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,400
Marines I remember like you know I'd

1544
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,259
pretend like going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the offense and</font>

1545
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,510
charging a hill and I remember being on

1546
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:10,120
the defense and protecting my base like

1547
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:11,140
we understood certain warfare tactics do

1548
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,000
we do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing right now in the</font>

1549
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,470
security industry no we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have those</font>

1550
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,240
simulations I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentesting as close</font>

1551
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,770
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to it until we actually test</font>

1552
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,759
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually look at it</font>

1553
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,370
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to have good</font>

1554
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:26,770
good good defense and mechanisms so it

1555
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:27,790
made any<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well</font>
