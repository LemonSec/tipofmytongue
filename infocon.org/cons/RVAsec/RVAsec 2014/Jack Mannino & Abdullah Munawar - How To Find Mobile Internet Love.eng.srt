1
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,009
I

2
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,030
by show of hands who in here uses dating

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:27,290
apps on their mobile device on a regular

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:29,030
basis or now and then all right who's

5
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,279
had sex with a complete stranger using a

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,930
dating app in the past year anybody yeah

7

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,590
guys anyways so just the basic gist is

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,370
we ripped open a bunch of dating

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:46,070
applications it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to</font>

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,660
find some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad things so there's a</font>

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,120
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bugs that we've reported out that</font>

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,260
maybe aren't fixed yet the things we'll

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,849
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today your things that</font>

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,489
different different rupes have either

16
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,750
fixed already or the other scenario is

17
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,669
that there's some groups that we reach

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maybe say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,250
and just didn't bother<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond or fix</font>

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,300
anything or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the road map so we</font>

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,950
feel that we could talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:18,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">things so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick I'm Jack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> veneno</font>

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:24,429
and I'm this guy I'm Abdullah Manohar

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:30,080
stereotype that's me right there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

25
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:35,539
yeah the token brown dude<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what</font>

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:38,959
we did we took a look at about 30 dating

27
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:42,800
applications across Android and iOS we

28
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:45,560
took a look at location data we took a

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,929
look at analytics<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were being passed</font>

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,080
back and forth we took a look at

31
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:55,450
information sharing and anything else we

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,450
pretty much thought was interesting we

33
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,440
we took a look now some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,740
applications were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really popular</font>

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,410
the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> base is in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> millions some of</font>

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,950
the applications were really small you

37
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,549
know the thousands and we are updating

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,549
office

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and so you know some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,440
were interested in is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what sort of data</font>

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,930
was being stored on the device from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,350
application is it anything sensitive was

43
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,370
it anything i encrypted etc we took a

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,960
look at the phone hardware and how was

45
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,730
interacting with the application where

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,700
was the application requesting things

47
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,200
that were completely and utterly

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,280
unreasonable not really needed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,280
but for some weird reason it was

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,550
requesting we also took a look at

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,830
additional applications in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,560
the mobile dating application to see how

53
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:07,100
is interacting the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter's the the</font>

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:10,860
facebooks etc Instagram all that stuff

55
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:15,420
now we're good so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old fashioned way</font>

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:19,350
of dating conventionally was you met

57
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,690
somebody through school or through some

58
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of social function maybe your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody and you took the time during</font>

the date to actually get to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

to date is all of these things are

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,359
predefined so you get matched up based

70
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,910
upon filling out some huge questionnaire

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,890
and they have some secret sauce

72
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,859
algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backend and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they match</font>

73
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,260
you up or you take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you browse</font>

74
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,310
through people's profiles and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

77
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">based upon shared interests what we</font>

78
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,080
found so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was some pretty</font>

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,798
interesting things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found across</font>

80
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,570
these applications so over<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy-five</font>

81
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of applications they contain at</font>

82
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,140
least one flaw that allowed us to the

83
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">anonymized user what that basically</font>

84
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">means is while the application itself</font>

85
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,040
would not displace sensitive information

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,550
on the back end<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire model the</font>

87
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,960
entire user model was being returned

88
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:47,450
that included<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like data birth</font>

89
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,739
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS coords everything and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,590
thing of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that all this data</font>

91
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,210
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found we really didn't do too</font>

92
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,010
much to be quite honest that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

93
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,750
have to look too far it's not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

94
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,330
tore apart our all tore apart all these

95
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,010
applications and look line by line at

96
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,530
the code I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was stuff we put a</font>

97
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,020
proxy in between and we saw this data

98
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,750
coming through it was pretty pretty

99
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,340
staggering<font color="#E5E5E5"> there sixty percent of all</font>

100
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,960
that approximately sixty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

101
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,169
the applications transmitted sensitive

102
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,520
data over the Internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> in plain text so</font>

103
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:23,289
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know credentials location as I</font>

104
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

105
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,830
application the communication between

106
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:31,310
the client and server it was also third

107
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,440
party analytics and ads and in a lot of

108
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,940
cases that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was unencrypted we actually</font>

109
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,900
it was interesting we actually saw

110
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,360
instances where the ads and analytics

111
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,070
were encrypted while the basic

112
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:49,610
application itself was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in the least</font>

113
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">pip approximately forty percent of the</font>

114
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,229
applications had access control

115
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:59,300
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> or session management</font>

116
00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:03,370
issues so what that means is the session

117
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:07,340
ID was the individuals email address

118
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,229
when we would click send me a hint to

119
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:15,409
remember my password I would actually

120
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:18,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">get emailed my password and also once</font>

121
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">you login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the application you're able</font>

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to basically change your username to</font>

123
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,780
anybody else and take over anybody

124
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,010
else's account pretty straightforward

125
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">not too difficult to do so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah there's</font>

126
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,770
an after that do we took a look at a

127
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,000
whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> types of</font>

128
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">applications we kind of wanted to</font>

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,830
highlight some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them Ashley Madison</font>

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,710
yeah that's for cheating on your

131
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,570
significant other your spouse it's

132
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:46,000
pretty straightforward they say over

133
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:51,330
what 21 20 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymous members</font>

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:01,540
anonymous right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a common interest</font>

135
00:06:51,330 --> 00:07:03,219
such as STDs and making new friends if

136
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,430
you're socially awkward you find it

137
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,900
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make new friends and and</font>

138
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,960
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit easier for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to talk</font>

139
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">with people online there's applications</font>

140
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,510
like this where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just talk about</font>

141
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">things hang out etc and there's also</font>

142
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:22,210
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird that a dating app based</font>

143
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,180
upon your professional network so you

144
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:31,180
use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> LinkedIn address book to</font>

145
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:35,320
basically find a match and just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

146
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,630

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,790
of it is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't conduct</font>

any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of criminal background</font>

screenings however we reserve the right

190
00:09:52,410 --> 00:10:01,709
to but we really don't at all this is a

191
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,769
joint statement from the state of

192
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:08,388
California partnering up with I believe

193
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:12,569
it's a harmony match and spark networks

194
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:15,809
to try and create some sort of standard

195
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:17,878
and goodwill amongst the the mobile

196
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:21,029
dating app and the dating app community

197
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:24,000
to say hey let's let's put ourselves to

198
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:27,720
a certain standard let's try and help

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,050
keep these users privacy and prevent

200
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,670
people who have background criminal

201
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,810
records etc out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these applications</font>

202
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,839
however

203
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,459
it's as you can kind of see<font color="#CCCCCC"> they even</font>

204
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,820
within it they state yeah it's kind of

205
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:50,340
hard to do this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> man if we can do a</font>

206
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:53,250
great if not and not a big deal and the

207
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing here is is that</font>

208
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,630
they don't really want these dating

209
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,790
applications to advertise that they have

210
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,500
any sort of sex offender<font color="#CCCCCC"> sex tracking</font>

211
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,060
type tools because they don't want it to

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,490
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make false claims to</font>

213
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,479
kind of fool the users into thinking

214
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,630
there's some sort of false sense of

215
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:19,260
security there<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and jack is</font>

218
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:29,040
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at so the</font>

219
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,420
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you put out there it's</font>

220
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty interesting because you can piece</font>

221
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,920
together and lots of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

222
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,690
kind of figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody is so if</font>

223
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,640
you have somebody's birth date and you

224
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,870
have maybe their zip code you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

225
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,770
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out that it may be</font>

226
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,420
there's two people with that same

227
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,210
birthday but you can narrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

228
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,829
maybe one or two people so we found you

229
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,140
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an obscene amount of this</font>

230
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,760
stuff out there and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really have</font>

231
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,189
seen me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we compared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the small</font>

232
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,330
apps to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big apps and we really</font>

233
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,830
didn't see any consistency like the big

234
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,600
guys got to write the small guys got it

235
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,920
wrong it's kind of like the big guys

236
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,190
were equal<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're screwed up as a small</font>

237
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,110
guys in most cases um with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exception</font>

238
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,650
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> X restricting like exif data off of</font>

239
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:10,170
images so Facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter they do it</font>

240
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,150
really well the bigger apps like tinder

241
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,130
plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fish they do a good job of</font>

242
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but the smaller apps yeah that</font>

243
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,020
stuff's all there in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> images to</font>

244
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically rip out of that some location</font>

245
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,220
services so the interesting things that

246
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're giving this stuff away these these</font>

247
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,700
applications suck if we're not giving

248
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> away I mean the whole appeal was</font>

249
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,839
finding people around you with some more

250
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">interests so if you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertising</font>

251
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:39,420
that information and vice versa so you

252
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:40,920
probably to connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people so</font>

253
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,290
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran into really three different</font>

254
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,540
scenarios when it comes to location the

255
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,610
first one is some apps just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

256
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,459
blatantly give away your<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact GPS</font>

257
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,579
coords there's some applications that

258
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,138
are

259
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,019
return the distance but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font>

260
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS coords themselves but assuming</font>

261
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">which will show an example of it if you</font>

262
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,079
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to change your location you</font>

263
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:03,420
can sort of triangulate with that person

264
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">is as long as you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the distance and</font>

265
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,769
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as it's some reasonable degree</font>

266
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:09,599
of precision that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get back the other</font>

267
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:11,179
thing we saw there was some apps there's

268
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,179
actually a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patent-pending</font>

269
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:16,799
algorithm that basically does shit which

270
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,850
lets you basically shift your location

271
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,379
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course if you shift the location</font>

272
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you still get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the distance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

273
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,040
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things basically you can still narrow</font>

274
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,239
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a reasonable range we didn't</font>

275
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,089
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> find any of those things really</font>

276
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,739
that effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> um basically we saw was</font>

277
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,449
probably the most effective was you know

278
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:35,399
you really can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it perfect but</font>

279
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:37,049
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more but you</font>

280
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically spread the distance out you</font>

281
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,139
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple feet that's a bad</font>

282
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,540
idea you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go to like a mile</font>

283
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:50,540
two miles kilometers it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

284
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:55,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasonable so here's an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example of an</font>

285
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,179
application it went off the side yeah

286
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:00,049
yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this one for example</font>

287
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:03,449
they just basically return the entire

288
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:05,610
user model so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really common in</font>

289
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,899
like MVC type applications so if anyone

290
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,600
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Model View controller type</font>

291
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,269
applications so in this example this is

292
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">just basically like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole user model</font>

293
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,019
so maybe map to like say a table the

294
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,299
user table and it's all the different

295
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,889
columns all the information in there so

296
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,929
all the MVC frameworks make it pretty

297
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:25,439
easy to take like a model a map it to

298
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:26,790
you know say JSON array and that's

299
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:28,819
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do so I'm like you</font>

300
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,379
know rails will seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a to JSON</font>

301
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:34,019
spring you have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jackson to do that</font>

302
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,059
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the MVC frameworks like</font>

303
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,799
support that and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just an example</font>

304
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,850
of something and most developers don't

305
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,769
realize we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing that to be</font>

306
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,939
perfectly honest because what they're

307
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,199
doing is they're pick and choose and

308
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,449
pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

309
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,919
displaying in the UI but beyond that

310
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:48,118
they discard the rest of it so like if

311
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,919
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> running through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a proxy but</font>

312
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:51,389
like shit there's GPS coords in there

313
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,169
but usually developers don't get around

314
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:57,989
to that strong mmhmm yeah which those

315
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:59,669
guys are actually fixing that so here's

316
00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:01,259
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of distance we talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

317
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:04,350
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually giving away the</font>

318
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,180
GPS coords but you can see so they have

319
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,600
of the distance and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

320
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,569
decimals behind that which translates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

321
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,700
a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller range where they could</font>

322
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,350
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so again if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

323
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,730
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> precision in their distance you</font>

324
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,730
could probably find for that person is

325
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,600
so yeah tinder had this problem while

326
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,250
back they fixed it there may be still

327
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,590
some ways around that but they fixed it

328
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:36,420
from what I understand but essentially

329
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:39,950
yeah next one go<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go back sorry</font>

330
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,719
on deck yeah sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I screwed that one up</font>

331
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,040
so really there's some things they can

332
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,570
do to kind of make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

333
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">better but then there's also you know</font>

334
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,800
some things that is just perfectly

335
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:53,100
honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and possible to fix for example</font>

336
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,500
if I'm in Romania and then I'm in the

337
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. like two seconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later unless you</font>

338
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,130
can teleport you probably not to do that

339
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,600
realistically so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

340
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,060
applications we<font color="#E5E5E5"> check they don't really</font>

341
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,770
flag that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird behavior they</font>

342
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,329
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it didn't really see</font>

343
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,370
anybody rate living how often you could

344
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,840
shift your location which that makes it

345
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that much easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

346
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,040
actually only<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull these types of things</font>

347
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,470
off so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if you put those things in</font>

348
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,530
place and say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> limit the users to</font>

349
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,850
doing it once twice three times an hour

350
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">just create more accounts and if you</font>

351
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,170
have 20 30 accounts you can continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

352
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,880
the same types of things so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

353
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">that easy but I mean the best way to do</font>

354
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is to basically spread out the</font>

355
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,030
distance and don't return like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

356
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:39,450
decimals you know of precision to where

357
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:40,740
the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is yes so just a</font>

358
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,170
couple examples of things that we saw

359
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,910
you know some over the location the root

360
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,110
cause in most cases was pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

361
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing where they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just blindly</font>

362
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,830
returned everything in the user model<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

363
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:56,160
yes so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of birth date</font>

364
00:16:52,830 --> 00:17:01,050
so this is Scout they didn't respond to

365
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">us so so you can see pretty much there's</font>

366
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,720
the person's birth date profiles you

367
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,310
could also get that person's name you

368
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,270
know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

369
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,950
there's a million different ways you

370
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">could use this thing called the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

371
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,880
to actually look that information up and

372
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,819
you can usually figure out that person

373
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,620
it's um

374
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,619
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another gem where they give you</font>

375
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,459
everybody's email addresses so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if</font>

376
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,099
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if your spouse is</font>

377
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,020
cheating on you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know assuming you</font>

378
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">send me technical you could actually</font>

379
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,139
basically bank through the entire range

380
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:36,900
of you know accounts that are on there

381
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:40,830
and pull back their email address so so

382
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,600
yeah not saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we saw any examples</font>

383
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one on the top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you're doing</font>

384
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,610
that you probably shouldn't do that and

385
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,110
to be honest like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if if being</font>

386
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,419
anonymous she's your number or concern

387
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,179
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shouldn't be using your own</font>

388
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,010
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> address your cell phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

389
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,540
there's some application<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my even</font>

390
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saving like cell phone number for</font>

391
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,550
example and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that also works with the</font>

392
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,500
forgot password so if you type that in

393
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,629
and you know it says up we sent an email

394
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,510
while your spouse might know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

395
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,400
registered with your phone to do that so

396
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,920
yeah if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymous I</font>

397
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,960
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say don't give much of your</font>

398
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,060
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> information away so social network</font>

399
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,700
so most the applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> being looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

400
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,179
allowed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's the ones that you</font>

401
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there they map to your social graph</font>

402
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,850
and there's some power in that because

403
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,919
instead of just meeting people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

404
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,300
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> common with they you</font>

405
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,670
know take all the information that

406
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,080
Facebook harvests about you and they can

407
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:41,160
tap into that so I mean there is some

408
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,919
power in that for sure but I guess the

409
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,600
problem with that is assuming like

410
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like Ashley Madison type of</font>

411
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,379
application you might not want people to

412
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,879
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go back to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

413
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,860
profile and see pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you and your</font>

414
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">wife and you know maybe friend your wife</font>

415
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,740
on facebook or your kids or you know

416
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,790
your mother so yeah nine times out of

417
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten if you doing that kind of stuff</font>

418
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,129
you're probably not the same person in

419
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,350
both lives like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's be honest there we</font>

420
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,580
did find examples where the applications

421
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,340
were leaking some of that stuff back<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

422
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,090
your Facebook ID your google plus ID

423
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,250
your twitter ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if you if you</font>

424
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,689
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> your Linkedin ID to like do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

425
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,650
kind of stuff then you s<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of</font>

426
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,280
deserve what's coming to you at that

427
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,720
point but yeah we did find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm are</font>

428
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,190
these applications we're actually in my

429
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,320
own need to basically go from you know

430
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,520
here's this guy wearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mask to you</font>

431
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,360
know here's this guy holding this baby

432
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,360
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad thing</font>

433
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:45,030
so yeah broken authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

434
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:46,890
definitely broken none of the

435
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,870
applications will look look that really

436
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,000
support in any sort of multi-factor

437
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,919
authentication nowadays it's pretty

438
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,840
straightforward not too<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated for</font>

439
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,309
the developers out there to implement

440
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,199
something like this so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't</font>

441
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:03,210
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of it except with one somewhat</font>

442
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:05,040
exception the only one app we looked at

443
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:09,990
the provider is somewhat of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on device</font>

444
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,490
passlock was the actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> madison black</font>

445
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,380
book this application is pretty

446
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,870
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

447
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,370
somewhat of a container that provides

448
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:23,550
like a burner cell phone number with

449
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:26,340
self-contained SMS capabilities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

450
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">accessed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> via this four-digit passcode</font>

451
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so it's different from your regular</font>

452
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,750
cell<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone number and communication is</font>

453
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,270
supposed to be self contained within the

454
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,780
application it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> stores your black</font>

455
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:46,550
book in the application itself however

456
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes oh oh that's an excellent question</font>

457
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:54,139
we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in a second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

458
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,240
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it definitely right</font>

459
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,850
there's no protection against brute

460
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,309
force attacks so this four-digit

461
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,350
combination your significant other can

462
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:10,080
just sit there and hammer away on it

463
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:12,178
until they crack it there is no pay

464
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,800
after X amount of invalid attempts we

465
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:16,230
wipe the container<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all this</font>

466
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,970
information to kind of keep you secure

467
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,480
there there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely nothing like</font>

468
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:25,800
that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the code a little</font>

469
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see up there at the top the key</font>

470
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,220
is a symmetric key and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

471
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's used for both encryption and</font>

472
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,190
decryption it's 16<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros which means</font>

473
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:42,659
that you can basically crack the

474
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:45,549
encryption with an application also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

475
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,409
username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> password for</font>

476
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:51,908
the application are stored and plain

477
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:54,309
text store locally with an application

478
00:21:51,909 --> 00:22:01,570
so yeah come some problems there with

479
00:21:54,309 --> 00:22:03,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">this app and so we kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font>

480
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,749
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> this out to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience so who</font>

481
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:09,129
can spot the problem with this and I

482
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:18,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they're going to win a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prize who</font>

483
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:19,959
can spot the problem anybody so that's

484
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:22,450
where actually sending or accessing

485
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:32,739
someone's messages so it's it's a

486
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:37,529
restful request hmm that's true but

487
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:45,809
there's another issue with that yes

488
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:50,230
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was that there you go</font>

489
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:51,399
somebody down there gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get one</font>

490
00:22:50,230 --> 00:23:00,909
whether you like it or not I'm just

491
00:22:51,399 --> 00:23:03,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">kidding okay all right um so I guess</font>

492
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:05,259
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about yep by the</font>

493
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:08,049
way that my loss of bugs there's some

494
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:13,720
really nasty ones out there so go find

495
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:19,029
them on your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> um next slide so ssl I</font>

496
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,200
mean this is you know a basic thing but

497
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:21,879
yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than half the</font>

498
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,830
application so this is christian mingle

499
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:25,539
so you know we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet Good</font>

500
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,460
Samaritan thing I mean we set a bunch of

501
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">bugs out and this was their answer don't</font>

502
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,759
know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you can see that the back</font>

503
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,139
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll read it it says thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

504
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,059
your inquiry so he wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them said</font>

505
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:35,590
hey like you don't encrypt like anything

506
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,178
your web app and your mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> app like</font>

507
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,279
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do that some</font>

508
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:41,830
point thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your inquiry we take</font>

509
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,359
security seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just to encrypt</font>

510
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,299
sensitive information before it's sent

511
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:49,330
over the internet protecting our members

512
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:50,739
personal information that's great except

513
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't actually encrypt it like when</font>

514
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:53,859
it's sent over the internet so

515
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:56,379
everything is in the plane from your

516
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:59,210
credentials to maybe financial stuff the

517
00:23:56,379 --> 00:24:03,709
session tokens your conversations

518
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:05,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so forth so yeah just here's an</font>

519
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,110
example I mean it's you know plain as

520
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:11,779
day just absolutely no encryption um

521
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:14,620
next one this one was from the positive

522
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:17,390
singles this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the STD dating app</font>

523
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,860
example another one were you know so

524
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,409
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you know if</font>

525
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,789
you're you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> running at a</font>

526
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:25,220
time Jane up there that we talked about

527
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:27,770
before maybe it's not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> big of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a deal</font>

528
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,450
but if you're Anthony Weiner and

529
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,129
somebody can sniff that data that's a

530
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:35,809
big deal like that's that's a bad day in

531
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:37,640
your life um next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and yeah he was</font>

532
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:45,559
scout this is another really big app and

533
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:47,029
they just they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care either so the</font>

534
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,039
other stuff we ran into and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

535
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,289
these these problems aren't specific to

536
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,610
you know dating apps these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are prevalent</font>

537
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,320
issues like it's a mobile apps

538
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,428
everywhere but you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> given the</font>

539
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,899
type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that you're sending back</font>

540
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:59,870
and forth with these types of things the

541
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:02,779
intimate conversations it kind of puts a

542
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,580
different twist on things so for

543
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:07,610
certificate issues so the apps that

544
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,199
actually did attempt SSL so you know

545
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,389
certificate pinning it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing</font>

546
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,850
like I'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I venture to say I'm even</font>

547
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,559
less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% of apps actually pin</font>

548
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificates so I'm like a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

549
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,690
back they made a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal out of the</font>

550
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:23,149
woods app application that they didn't

551
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,529
pin certificates but I mean nobody's

552
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:26,959
pinning stick its Facebook does it

553
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:29,270
Twitter does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe some financials</font>

554
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,289
but it's it's still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small part of the</font>

555
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:35,690
population that actually does

556
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:37,730
certificate pinning so here's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

557
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:41,120
example of code that's actually taken

558
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,770
from an OAuth project so basically you

559
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,320
provide the public key you don't really

560
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,789
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the ca's in between if the</font>

561
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">right private</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys on the other side</font>

562
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:51,260
then you talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and it just</font>

563
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,799
kind of removed some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

564
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole process but yeah I mean zero</font>

565
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,850
percent of those applications were doing

566
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:01,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">it like not a single application was</font>

567
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,270
attempting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a pin or certificate they</font>

568
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,880
should probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing</font>

569
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:10,700
to do some apps also take the liberty of

570
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,100
turning off ssl checks for certificate

571
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,660
issues so

572
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,699
here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one this was from the</font>

573
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:20,660
jamo app and they're fixing that one so

574
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">can anybody tell me what the problem is</font>

575
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:28,090
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so what this is is the ssl</font>

576
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:31,100
code so they've implemented their own

577
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:34,270
logic outside of with the you know

578
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,469
standard HP client library provides

579
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:40,490
what's happening there can anybody tell

580
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,440
me exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so what happens there</font>

581
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,789
is that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody is you know in</font>

582
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">position the man in the middle you so it</font>

583
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:49,580
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pedo intelligence it could be</font>

584
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,710
you know you're you know spouse that

585
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,879
thinks you're up to no good and yeah

586
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,460
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much turn off all the</font>

587
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,200
checks there so each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those you</font>

588
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">know methods basically doesn't throw</font>

589
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,700
anything so if it was actually in a

590
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,260
normal world where if they weren't doing

591
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,400
that you know either the connections

592
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,200
going to fail and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw an</font>

593
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,179
exception but the point is you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

594
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,350
sending data back and forth so in this

595
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:11,030
scenario it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much completely</font>

596
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:15,799
transparent to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user that that's</font>

597
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happening to them so we talked</font>

598
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,789
a lot about you know the applications

599
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,980
themselves so I mean as an app developer

600
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,650
you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to control these</font>

601
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">things encrypt communications do the</font>

602
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,159
right thing with certificate errors and

603
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:29,750
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're most</font>

604
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,760
developers kind of miss<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know drop</font>

605
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,230
the ball on is when they start dropping

606
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,408
in like third party libraries so

607
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,789
analytics and networks so you know

608
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:39,380
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much with a user networks their</font>

609
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,299
goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make money like support the</font>

610
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,220
application that monetize them by

611
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:46,820
serving you you know obnoxious ads about

612
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:49,210
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you never want to buy so really</font>

613
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,129
have to be careful with some of these

614
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,559
definitely some privacy concerns in this

615
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">example here the sudden your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS coords</font>

616
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,059
plane tax so imagine the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

617
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,289
application is doing it right there just

618
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:02,840
shuttle in this stuff alive so a lot of

619
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:05,870
times to be perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> honest like the</font>

620
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,970
developers don't really pay attention to

621
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they will enable permissions in the</font>

622
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,720
application that you know maybe only the

623
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,100
ad network needs that their application

624
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,690
are actually leverage it but they'll try

625
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,889
to run it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've like oh I'm</font>

626
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting this exception security</font>

627
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,890
exception this permission is not there

628
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:20,530
so they'll just start dropping

629
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,870
permissions and just they can use these

630
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:26,570
networks so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason the ad networks</font>

631
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,918
go to the next one um

632
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,399
in this example here so they're actually

633
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending your mac address so whereas in a</font>

634
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,959
browser you can you know have a tracking

635
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:38,330
cookie and you know possibly track

636
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,309
across different sites it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

637
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,710
harder on<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS and Android because you</font>

638
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:43,940
know there is some sandboxing so for

639
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">example if you were to drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that into</font>

640
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,620
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequin white database on the app</font>

641
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:51,110
in theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the app should actually</font>

642
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,459
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read that data so the ad</font>

643
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,019
networks have resorted to other things

644
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,460
where they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of like</font>

645
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,720
dropping that on there they're actually

646
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,519
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like identify based on the</font>

647
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,700
device so they can track you between

648
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ad networks so one</font>

649
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,600
of the things they can track you with is

650
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:07,699
mac addresses they can use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vice IDs</font>

651
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,769
there's another popular way of doing it

652
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,940
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the point is the stuff is just</font>

653
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:12,110
getting sent out there and most

654
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,129
developers don't know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

655
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,090
happening here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another good one so as</font>

656
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,789
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sign up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this one</font>

657
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,580
application it goes on to tell Google

658
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:23,750
you sexual preferences so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

659
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,070
follow up to seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you would</font>

660
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">change that if the edge you would get</font>

661
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,370
would actually change afterwards based

662
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:29,750
on that I know that's a pet project

663
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,758
somebody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that I me know how</font>

664
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,190
that works out but yeah there's sudden

665
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,960
your sexual preference out so you know I

666
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,309
mean if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting it out there and</font>

667
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,779
to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Google probably knows</font>

668
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,700
us anyway and it's a moot point right

669
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:48,759
but in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> event yeah that's could</font>

670
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:48,759
potentially piss some people off<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

671
00:29:51,919 --> 00:30:02,789
so don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the right way if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a</font>

672
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:05,940
developer really don't be a dick don't

673
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:07,950
opt your users into things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

674
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,749
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hate you for that they're going</font>

675
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get spammed with your email address</font>

676
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:14,029
their personal information is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

677
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,320
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out just don't do it it's not nice</font>

678
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:18,210
you would be amazed oh by the way how

679
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">many of the applications actually do</font>

680
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:24,840
auto opt you into sharing your location

681
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:26,279
sharing stuff like your birthday<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

682
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,259
if you use in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these applications</font>

683
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,570
like before you do much on them go into

684
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">your settings I mean if if the</font>

685
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">application actually has like a</font>

686
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">web-enabled version and a mobile version</font>

687
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,889
do it on the web version so the the

688
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,929
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we also caught in some</font>

689
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:42,330
of the apps that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mobile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> version</font>

690
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:44,879
and a web version is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they actually</font>

691
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:47,789
return different information from the

692
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:50,248
API versus like the conventional forms

693
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:51,509
based kind of web application and we

694
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the root cause of that is like</font>

695
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:54,929
just like we said which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically</font>

696
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,539
mapping and returning like the whole

697
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,249
model from an API versus in the forms

698
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:02,369
based application they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> just take</font>

699
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:04,499
bits and pieces of it and you know add a

700
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:06,178
variable to return mobile stories like

701
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:07,740
we found you know huge discrepancies

702
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,749
between the web and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile versions of</font>

703
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,610
what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> return so if you can do it and</font>

704
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:13,499
first using it registers to the web

705
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:20,850
application turn off everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

706
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:23,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then have fun hope for the best pay</font>

707
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:26,009
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which expose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so deck talked</font>

708
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,139
about it earlier you know to typically

709
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,869
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email address that's not your</font>

710
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:33,740
primary email address may not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

711
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">put your real date of birth out there</font>

712
