00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,720
dentist but he was a great basketball

85
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,520
third-party risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't know if</font>

read the news or regulated business

89
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,820
third-party risk has been a major factor

90
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:40,510
in data breaches as well as helping

91
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,769
manage you know how do how companies are

lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to come into this</font>

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,370
industry right and we're seeing mass

97
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,600
adoption of cloud technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> third</font>

98
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">party outsourcing is that its</font>

99
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,030
highest-ever right IBM last quarter said

100
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,040
we had a billion-dollar decline in

101
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,470
hardware we had a billion dollar

102
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,940
increase in cloud right a lot of data is

103
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,580
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the cloud and companies today</font>

104
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,950
are either are primarily software or I'm

105
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry their design firms and sales firms</font>

106
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,738
right everything else they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

107
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">get rid of so as security professionals</font>

108
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,149
how do you manage in that environment

109
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,108
how do you really show value as a

110
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,010
professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people I</font>

111
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about getting into this</font>

112
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,190
industry and CEOs really look at third

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">party risk his way to do that because</font>

114
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,790
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really one of the only business</font>

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,220
processes that you can show business

116
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,330
improvement while dealing with reduction

117
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and risk reducing costs and dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

118
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,190
tectonic shifts in technology including

119
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,580
the clap or talk a little bit about that

120
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,230
so this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been the conversation pretty</font>

121
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,770
much at every organization i've talked

122
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,840
you talking a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wars a lot of CEOs</font>

123
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,630
we live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a post target post heartbleed</font>

124
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,330
world right so talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wife again</font>

125
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,020
my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided two days after the</font>

126
00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:00,099
breach at target she<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the newspaper</font>

127
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,409
said they said it's fixed right she

128
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,940
decides<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to target by something so</font>

129
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,890
six weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> later of course we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

130
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,160
letter here's a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card the</font>

131
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,180
interesting thing about this is that

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,850
today people are really concerned

133
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">because this is impacting all the way up</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CEO right so now it started with</font>

135
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
a 40 million credit cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think then</font>

136
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">they identified it with 70 million</font>

137
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,830
records i think it's now what up to 110

138
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,930
million records for target and the cost

139
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,479
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data breaches now to about six</font>

140
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,900
hundred million dollars i think i'm one

141
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those those poor souls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> due to my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wife</font>

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,559
code that people were concerned about it

147
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,210
seems like there's some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

148
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,630
today that people are concerned about

149
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I was with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a large insurance company</font>

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,400
stop their entire security program in

152
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,720
its tracks everybody got told we're

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go look at heart bleep right I</font>

154
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,570
don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was the same type of</font>

155
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that you saw in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

organizations but a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago my</font>

157
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,150
wife decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to michaels I don't</font>

158
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,340
know what it is you she<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes the shop</font>

159
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,130
at places where we're seeing major cyber

160
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,049
security issues but I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to announce</font>

161
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,350
something here<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I do you see the</font>

162
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:22,180
trend I don't know have you seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

163
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:25,870
trend between these yeah you're right

164
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,090
it's red logos so I'm announcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here</font>

165
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,560
today absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> ads major major</font>

166
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,270
security risk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> red logos I'm actually</font>

167
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,570
really concerned about American Heart

168
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,219
Association after heartbleed and all

169
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,070
joking aside right this is obviously a

170
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,950
joke the reality is that when we're

171
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,780
talking about third-party risk it's not

172
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,570
and people trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with this it's</font>

173
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,130
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's when right so when we're</font>

174
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,719
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with CEOs it's really trying to</font>

175
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,880
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something that you know is</font>

176
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,580
inevitable this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a situation</font>

177
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,889
where managing this process

178
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,090
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times if your drive trying to</font>

179
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,560
drive a cert team right you have an

180
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">incident you can get your arms around it</font>

181
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,050
third parties a lot different and we're

182
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,840
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

183
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,300
challenges but obviously a kind of a

184
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,388
tongue-in-cheek situation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red</font>

185
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,750
logos I please don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

186
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:15,610
with people with red logos total joke so

187
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">semantic is actually identified</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

188
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to talk a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about the</font>

189
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,900
reach research so semantics identified

190
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,310
that last year was the year of the mega

191
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,780
breach<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you've heard this</font>

192
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,509
or if you've read the internet security

193
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,289
threat report I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like that</font>

194
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,270
terminology but the the key points here

195
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:34,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than eight breaches</font>

196
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,460
with 10 million or more records lost

197
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,020
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> unabated and we're</font>

198
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">continuing to see obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the</font>

199
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,068
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this conference has</font>

200
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,509
been around how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage this how do</font>

201
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,340
we deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this how do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do deal with</font>

202
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">this in our own companies the issue is</font>

203
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,448
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with this at vendors and</font>

204
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:51,460
third parties some of the interesting to

205
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,520
statistics revolve around who's actually

206
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,039
getting impacted right so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

207
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,960
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare education</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Center</font>

208
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,849
accounted for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty eight percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

209
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,318
the data breaches but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

210
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:04,539
those other organizations that are

211
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,509
impacting the number of records lost

212
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:10,479
retail software and financial sectors

213
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:13,029
are the ones that are impacting records

214
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,520
lost the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most right and when we start</font>

215
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:17,139
digging into the size of organization

216
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,049
this is where it becomes really relevant

217
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:21,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a third-party perspective so you</font>

218
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,680
have different organizations and

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,469
different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies getting</font>

220
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,659
hacked including you know retail

221
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,979
education etc but the size of the

222
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:31,569
organization that's getting impacted

223
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,490
over the last three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years has changed</font>

224
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,079
dramatically it used to be people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

225
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">going after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest organizations in</font>

226
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:38,198
the world they're now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

227
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:39,698
weakest link they're going after smaller

228
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:41,439
organizations mid-sized organizations

229
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,718
and over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years we've seen</font>

230
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">a massive shift in terms of what targets</font>

231
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,130
are being you know what what are the

232
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:51,010
targets look like and so these are your

233
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,120
vendors right in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases I know</font>

234
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,100
some of you here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are from</font>

235
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,959
extraordinarily large organizations and

236
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,459
surely you're still targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> right people</font>

237
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,920
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you but they're actually</font>

238
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going after much smaller organizations</font>

239
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,099
that you do business<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and this</font>

240
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,449
becomes happen you know the real

241
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,100
challenge in terms of how do you get

242
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:08,750
security coverage

243
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,950
so the other part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

244
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,770
regulatory perspective from a

245
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,000
third-party risk perspective we said

246
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the shared assessment steering</font>

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,290
committee a lot and around the table we

248
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,290
look at each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and we go we have</font>

249
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,290
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen so much regulatory coverage</font>

250
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,900
around a topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

251
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party risk management so anybody</font>

252
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,939
impacted by PCI anybody have PCI

253
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,680
requirements I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of hands back</font>

254
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,860
there so looks like fifty sixty percent

255
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,599
right pci 30 hit over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last nine</font>

256
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,280
months occ any large banks yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> OCC I</font>

257
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,380
think there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of people with</font>

258
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,790
the same right so I see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hands</font>

259
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">going like twice or OCC CFPB HIPAA</font>

260
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,079
omnibus all of these regulatory

261
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,060
requirements have focused on third-party

262
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,070
risk you may be looking at NIST

263
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,439
cybersecurity framework right have

264
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,240
third-party risk requirements or as part

265
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,310
of the framework so when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font>

266
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,860
of this coverage again the last nine

267
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,540
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been that that's just been</font>

268
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,920
pouring on right so how do you get

269
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,630
coverage around this how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font>

270
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,430
this especially as all of these

271
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,470
regulatory<font color="#E5E5E5"> tailwinds are hitting and all</font>

272
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,239
of this is just hitting now right when I

273
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,610
look at a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people dealing with</font>

274
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,590
HIPAA omnibus OCR is just starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

275
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,870
talk to organizations about how do they

276
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,160
how are they better managing third-party

277
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,840
risk we'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the the</font>

278
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,189
third party area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so from a PCI</font>

279
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,710
perspective there's three or four

280
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,570
coverage areas section 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> 28 and section</font>

281
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,550
12 9 are really the critical ones when

282
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,220
it comes to third-party risk management

283
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so this really talks about having to</font>

284
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,450
have written agreements that identify

285
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,580
who's responsible for third-party risk

286
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,050
making sure that your vendors sign up

287
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,030
for their responsibilities that they're

288
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,010
managing pci and that they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

289
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,449
in a meaningful way right we also have

290
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the requirement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you actually have</font>

291
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,390
to perform due diligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

292
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about a case in a few minutes where</font>

293
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,100
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in a data breach</font>

294
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,650
with a cloud provider an e-commerce

295
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,080
platform provider and who said they were

296
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">PCI compliant unfortunately the retailer</font>

297
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,860
didn't actually do what they needed to

298
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,880
do as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this requirement in doing</font>

299
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,890
their due diligence which would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

300
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,210
helped satisfy this requirement but

301
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:16,250
section 812 812 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 the other thing</font>

302
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do on a regular basis</font>

303
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,230
is make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the vendors actually</font>

304
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,480
signing up for what we're describing as

305
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,010
the cardholder data environment and

306
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,500
there's a responsibility matrix as part

307
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,150
of 30 that really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that organizations</font>

308
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,010
need to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their providers</font>

309
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,260
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody understands who</font>

310
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,700
is responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what and PCI right so</font>

311
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,200
that's a relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> new requirement and</font>

312
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,030
then come june of next year there's

313
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,150
going to be much more significance

314
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:44,310
around pci<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 with section 12 9 in</font>

315
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,810
making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that vendors proactively are</font>

316
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,459
telling you about what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

317
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of that responsibility and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

318
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,900
they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the hook for that</font>

319
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,880
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to occ if you're a large</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bank this is all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the banks have</font>

321
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">been talking about and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aussi see book</font>

322
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,920
guidance out there they say it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

323
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,780
very it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be</font>

324
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,610
prescriptive you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do what you</font>

325
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,560
need you know what you feel is most

326
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,850
appropriate so as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shared</font>

327
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,459
assessments we had a summit a couple

328
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks ago and some of the OCC regulators</font>

329
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,170
as well as some of the people from PCI

330
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,870
standards the standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> Council sat on a</font>

331
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,310
panel and they talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the</font>

332
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,680
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the banks are really</font>

333
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,660
seeing that says a prescription for how

334
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,370
they manage third-party risk and what

335
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,160
they've done is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually provided a</font>

336
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,040
guideline<font color="#CCCCCC"> for how do you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're</font>

337
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a framework for this</font>

338
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,740
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about assessment you know</font>

339
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,729
we go really<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about oversight</font>

340
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,010
monitoring in response right so that's

341
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,450
sort of a framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the OCC and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

342
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,620
we're really recommending that companies

343
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,630
look at it they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve this</font>

344
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,220
problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has become a really big</font>

345
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">issue for large banks who are really</font>

346
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,210
struggling with<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to scale how do</font>

347
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you manage to scale in terms of being</font>

348
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,770
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assess your third parties and</font>

349
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,370
your fourth parties as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as monitor</font>

350
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:58,230
your third<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fourth parties it's funny</font>

351
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,700
I we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've someone who's joking me</font>

352
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,900
out we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know where the second party</font>

353
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,300
was right you can't say vendor risk

354
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,620
anymore by the way that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally taboo</font>

355
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,569
in this environment can't say vendors

356
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,430
you have to say third party or fourth

357
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,350
party I was joking we don't know where

358
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,670
the second party went no idea if

359
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,490
somebody can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you no answer that for me</font>

360
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">great I think it's about affiliates</font>

361
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,630
honestly but from a HIPAA perspective

362
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:24,810
HIPAA omnibus has changed in terms of

363
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:27,060
absolutely any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hospital covered entities</font>

364
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,290
here hospital systems know the

365
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,790
interesting thing about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is even</font>

366
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,040
though if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not you may not be have</font>

367
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,910
coverage around HIPAA this is impacting

368
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,259
you from a regulatory perspective

369
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,339
because the regular

370
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,899
Gators are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to each other</font>

371
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,779
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's happening is their</font>

372
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,489
mandates and requirements of HIPAA that

373
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,979
are starting to feed themselves into

374
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:45,419
privacy regulations requirements as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

375
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:47,009
as into some of the regulations we just

376
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,809
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's interesting</font>

377
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,609
about this is they redefined what a

378
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:53,009
business associate is and they've also

379
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:55,199
redefined when you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notify of a</font>

380
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:57,179
breach there's also requirements for

381
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,858
running a due diligence process if you

382
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,999
don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually automatically have</font>

383
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:05,129
significant liability and what's

384
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:06,600
described as willful neglect so hospital

385
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,160
systems and covered entities today

386
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,929
actually have to perform assessment

387
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,868
internally and / for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a performance</font>

388
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:14,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Essman externally if they don't they</font>

389
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:16,169
it's considered willful neglect if

390
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:17,999
there's a data breach or suspected data

391
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:20,879
breach hospitals now have an obligation

392
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:23,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to report that in a more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meaningful way</font>

393
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,410
after HIPAA omnibus and i can tell you

394
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,419
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these organizations they</font>

395
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,559
are struggling<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this right this is</font>

396
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:33,029
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really problematic and the harm</font>

397
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,728
threshold right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be</font>

398
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming and impacting all of you so we've</font>

399
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:40,499
been dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the data breach</font>

400
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,299
situation where it's been in retail at

401
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:44,609
what are this we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with one in</font>

402
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:46,350
the retail environment if this was in

403
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:48,029
health care we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had to</font>

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,739
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organization to work</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with would have had to already notify on</font>

406
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:55,859
this just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suspect the suspicion of a</font>

407
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,118
loss of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pH I is enough now and people</font>

408
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:59,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">are really struggling with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

409
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:00,600
how do they know when to notify what is

410
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,949
the appropriate time and when you're

411
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with this from a third-party</font>

412
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:07,079
perspective it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to get</font>

413
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,730
visibility so when we manage this

414
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,819
problem we're really talking about the

415
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,529
data supply chain for us as prevalent we

416
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:15,748
only look at where the data is going

417
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">right or where people are coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in so</font>

418
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,230
target has kind of changed the

419
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,029
conversation a bit it used to be where

420
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,619
are we sending our data and who are they

421
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,989
sending them to third and fourth parties

422
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:26,549
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also applies to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are</font>

423
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:28,230
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and actually helping us manage</font>

424
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,659

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,429
sensitive information as well and this

426
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:33,869
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new problem people have been</font>

427
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:35,100
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long time you</font>

428
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:38,129
may have been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this for a</font>

429
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">long time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so why is it hitting now why</font>

430
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:42,179
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it such a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell you that</font>

431
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,759
the reason that we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

432
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,289
there's a problem is organizations will

433
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,180
say I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so</font>

434
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:49,920
CEO sees an article about target

435
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,620
says we need to go solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> third party</font>

436
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,870
risk today and what happens is generally

437
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,610
people will find one or two people in

438
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,060
the organization say you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

439
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,610
work on vendor risk great they say where

440
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,079
do we start generally it's you know they

441
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,279
start with questionnaires<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we need</font>

442
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we need to get our questionnaire</font>

443
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,580
set up I don't know if you've had this

444
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,110
experience and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> go okay now we</font>

445
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,610
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to all our vendors and maybe</font>

446
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,230
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a policy that says you have to</font>

447
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,690
do assessment of all your vendors

448
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,750
annually and they get they get started

449
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:21,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if you have one or two people they</font>

450
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,190
generally get through 25 vendors I don't

451
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,750
know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're of any if</font>

452
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have an organization very sighs you</font>

453
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,800
got 500 vendors maybe a thousand vendors

454
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,360
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was sitting on a panel with</font>

455
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,589
the seesaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aetna he thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he had 15</font>

456
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,480
cloud providers he set up a and

457
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:42,000
basically a web filtering device looking

458
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,790
at where data was going he had a

459
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,980
directory of cloud providers how many of

460
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:56,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think he had in his environment he</font>

461
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:58,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he had 15 and he guess 5500 he</font>

462
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,730
had fee thought he had 15 that had he

463
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,170
had authorized he at 500 so a lot of

464
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,420
times people get through these<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

465
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,949
the question becomes your policies you

466
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,399
have to assess all of them right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

467
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go to back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 25 or 50 you just</font>

468
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,010
did where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to the next 25 or 50</font>

469
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,329
it's this vicious cycle that people are

470
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,609
really struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and that's really</font>

471
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:20,059
what challenging people today how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

472
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,438
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to scale how do we manage this a</font>

473
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,599
couple of other interesting statistics

474
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,850
people are really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define where</font>

475
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,899
their data breaches are coming from

476
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,520
trust we have identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost eighty</font>

477
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,770
percent of data breaches are coming from

478
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,800
third parties will call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party</font>

479
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,200
error<font color="#CCCCCC"> pwc and very code have identified</font>

480
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about twenty to twenty-five</font>

481
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,170
percent of organizations are actually

482
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,840
doing anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this right so</font>

483
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:46,020
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem not a lot of</font>

484
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about this everybody</font>

485
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,230
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Institute so when</font>

486
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,970
you read the paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say oh this</font>

487
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,740
data breach was<font color="#E5E5E5"> five million dollars</font>

488
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,230
right the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of a data breach</font>

489
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,790
is two hundred dollars a record that's

490
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,860
research that was done by the pond

491
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,200
institute right so anuman<font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute did</font>

492
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,810
a report middle of last year where they

493
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,670
identified

494
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> error for the first time is</font>

495
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:10,870
the number one factor in the cost of a

496
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:12,669
data breach and so that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it used</font>

497
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,899
to be lost or stolen devices well you

498
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,460
guys have licked that right you put

499
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,410
encryption on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptops that's</font>

500
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,180
becoming less of a risk but third-party

501
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,860
error is the number one factor and when

502
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,940
we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the cost of the data breach</font>

503
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:28,000
you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US if a third party is</font>

504
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:32,290
involved in a data breach it<font color="#E5E5E5"> increases</font>

505
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost by $43 a record I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

506
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,250
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not a lot of money 43</font>

507
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,410
bucks that's that's like you know dinner

508
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,630
right the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

509
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,040
at the research an average data breach

510
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,540
and this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of last year an</font>

511
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,330
average data breach in this report was

512
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">35 thousand records so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

513
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">data breach was there was due to a third</font>

514
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,810
party it was increasing costs by about a

515
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,090
million a little over a million dollars

516
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:57,820
after target though you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

517
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,080
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that I don't know if you've</font>

518
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,889
read a lot of the research but target

519
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,990
was really started by a lack of security

520
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,790
control at a vendor right and you can

521
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,460
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much that's already costing that</font>

522
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,670
organization including their CEOs job so

523
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:15,210
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting statistics and we</font>

524
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:18,460
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> firsthand right so we had a</font>

525
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:21,640
large global retailer come to us about

526
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,780
six months ago and they started getting

527
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,480
calls from their customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

528
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,430
customers are saying we think you've

529
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">been involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a data breach because</font>

530
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,360
we used our credit card on your website

531
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,580
and then we got a notification from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

532
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,649
bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we were brought in from an</font>

533
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,840
advisory perspective to really help this

534
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,800
organization start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what's</font>

535
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on soon after we started talking</font>

536
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,030
to this vendor or<font color="#E5E5E5"> this merchant the</font>

537
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,949
merchant brought in their friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

538
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,950
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing today with six different</font>

539
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,570
merchants that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ecommerce</font>

540
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,100
platform in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is really</font>

541
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because some of them had</font>

542
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,639
common point of purchase notifications

543
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,720
so from a banking perspective these are

544
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,040
the notifications where the bank

545
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,280
actually identifies and their fraud

546
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,710
software that you're the common point of

547
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,200
intrusion and then some only had

548
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,660
customer complaints right so we set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

549
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,040
our platform and we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking and</font>

550
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,900
what's interesting about this case is

551
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,820
that the customer

552
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,760
and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way I've changed all of the</font>

553
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,419
name all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the locations to protect the</font>

554
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,700
innocent<font color="#CCCCCC"> here but main customers in</font>

555
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chicago right ecommerce platform</font>

556
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,540
providers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York and in this case</font>

557
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:36,129
the e-commerce platform provider had a

558
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:39,080
single contract with with development

559
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,760
support and they were hosting it in

560
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,750
another yet another cloud provider so

561
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,420
what was happening is they had

562
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,870
authorized a vendor to be used in Dallas

563
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:51,050
that help them support all their clients

564
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,610
we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in after you know they had</font>

565
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,530
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we set up our platform</font>

566
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,540
and we started mapping out the rest of

567
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,250
the data supply chain it was very

568
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting we quickly identified that</font>

569
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:04,600
there was an operational support

570
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:07,520
mechanism happening in Russia and

571
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,070
development in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India and what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

572
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,170
identified was that these vendors were

573
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,740
never authorized right in contract these

574
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors had never been authorized the</font>

575
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,000
ecommerce provider said they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI</font>

576
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,880
compliant and what we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing was</font>

577
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,660
that each of these providers had<font color="#E5E5E5"> site to</font>

578
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">site VPN into the data center they</font>

579
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,810
climbed to site B pions into the data

580
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,580
center and they had administrative

581
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,409
control they administered administrative

582
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,770
access and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Active Directory they had the</font>

583
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,360
ability to set up any<font color="#CCCCCC"> user they wanted</font>

584
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,760
scratching your head wait a second let's

585
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,530
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go against pci I your PCI compliant</font>

586
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,750
right we very quickly identified that

587
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,480
they weren't PCI compliant right that

588
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,190
they weren't able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show PCI compliance</font>

589
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,470
through their supply chain we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even found</font>

590
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,330
that the provider that was hosting the

591
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,630
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them wasn't actually</font>

592
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:59,090
performing backups off-site that was

593
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:02,090
part of the contract right so you know

594
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,649
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a mess and when we started</font>

595
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,120
really looking at it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest</font>

596
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,700
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the environment the fulfillment was</font>

597
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,459
outsourced as well as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

598
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,330
banking relationship clearly you know

599
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,340
that's where we started getting

600
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,620
notifications from so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was a this</font>

601
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,959
basic data supply chain right this this

602
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,159
starts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really really complex when</font>

603
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,900
you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these global</font>

604
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,050
organizations so what we did is we

605
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually started looking at where the</font>

606
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:29,120
risks were coming from we overlaid our

607
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,340
vendor threat information we overlaid

608
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,959
symantec threaten data and we started

609
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,449
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where this compromise was</font>

610
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,920
coming from and then it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

611
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,440
felt you know the changes started

612
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,400
falling now the interesting part about

613
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,980
this case is that we were brought in and

614
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,559
the vendor had already started a PFI

615
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,650
investigation so they had hired a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI</font>

616
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,700
forensic investigator and normally when

617
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,550
you get into those types of situations

618
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,740
you see like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really small part of the</font>

619
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment is clipped off and that's</font>

620
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,670
how they do their forensic investigation

621
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,090
in this case the PFI had already

622
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,920
selected<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire ecommerce platform</font>

623
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,879
hundreds of servers that they had

624
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,740
actually brought in they were doing

625
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,690
forensic analysis around just became a

626
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,100
really really big challenge and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

627
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,690
interesting about the outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

628
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,309
was similar to HIPAA omnibus the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

629
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,660
with managing this is normally you see

630
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,309
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this you put your team</font>

631
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,690
together you'd identify all the people

632
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want on the team and</font>

633
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,080
you go after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right you'd go figure</font>

634
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">out how to stop this from happening and</font>

635
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,189
go put those fire extinguishers in place

636
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the right team on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the problem</font>

637
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,570
is as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party risk you can't do</font>

638
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have this concept of agency and</font>

639
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,409
when you when you can't actually touch

640
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,910
the environment it's a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

641
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,050
experience right and if you've never

642
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone through a data breach with a</font>

643
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party this is the problem and</font>

644
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,200
getting the vendor to actually help

645
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,090
comply with solving this problem becomes

646
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,090
really challenging because all of their

647
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,050
customers were on fire right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we</font>

648
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,199
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was amazing</font>

649
00:23:54,050 --> 00:24:00,350
everybody started kind of lawyering up

650
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,630
immediately and so at first it was a

651
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,129
very technical conversation and then it

652
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,030
became a legal conversation because

653
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,830
everybody thought they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

654
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,678
sued right and the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

655
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these people had to do and this</font>

656
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,059
contract for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this vendor existed for</font>

657
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:16,399
five years all they had to do was

658
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:18,410
perform a due diligence assessment

659
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">upfront and they would have quickly</font>

660
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,610
identified a lot of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

661
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,800
started identifying afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the</font>

662
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,169
cost of this is in the hundreds of

663
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of dollars for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients</font>

664
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got it could have been</font>

665
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,480
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars right if they had</font>

666
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,360
performed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> upfront so interesting</font>

667
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,480
interesting interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> you scared</font>

668
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting case study I talked about</font>

669
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at RSA actually and what was</font>

670
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,530
interesting is when we were going

671
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,929
through this

672
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:50,060
process we had CEO CFO and reporting

673
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,010
directly to the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all of the six</font>

674
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,830
customers that were impacted by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so</font>

675
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,600
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming a really critical you</font>

676
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,580
know problem and it's at the highest

677
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,760
level right and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really why it's</font>

678
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,770
it's becoming critical target as an

679
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,620
example with the CEO losing their job

680
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:09,889
this just raised this all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

681
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,030
the top in terms of importance so let's

682
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you know I want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font>

683
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the common challenges I've only got a</font>

684
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,810
few more minutes and I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

685
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,120
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some questions if you have them</font>

686
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,649
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you know we walk into</font>

687
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,439
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go I don't even know</font>

688
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,350
who my vendors are right see so what

689
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,360
Aetna said he thought he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had 15 cloud</font>

690
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:29,209
vendors he ended up having 500 after

691
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,280
investigating it right heartbleed we had

692
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,350
that customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> who had 80,000 vendors</font>

693
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,750
couldn't I actually identify whether

694
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,010
what all the software in use right just

695
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,810
trying to understand where your vendors

696
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,879
are becomes a really common challenge in

697
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,250
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of organizations at any size and</font>

698
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,130
being able to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that becomes part</font>

699
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,150
of how you manage us so one of the

700
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,550
things that's nice about third-party

701
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,820
risk is if there's silos in the

702
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,440
organization around IT security

703
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,120
procurement legal this is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

704
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to bring everybody together right</font>

705
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,479
people want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a</font>

706
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,980
meaningful way to figure out who they're

707
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,450
dealing with how they manage this

708
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,730
procurement loves it because they can

709
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,700
leverage this potentially as a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

710
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,110
reduce costs as well right so beginning

711
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,330
those stakeholders together becomes a

712
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,030
really nice part and of third-party risk

713
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,070
management we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to</font>

714
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,110
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at assessment technologies whether</font>

715
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,580
that be from Symantec or netskope we

716
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,290
have the ability now to dig in to start

717
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,510
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our software providers are</font>

718
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,070
cloud providers working with procurement

719
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,200
you can start digging into<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems like</font>

720
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,300
SI p and oracle and start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

721
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,120
vendors who need to get paid so one of

722
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">my other customers came to me and they</font>

723
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:40,070
said we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> found five thousand users</font>

724
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:42,350
in dropbox and that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be okay but they</font>

725
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:45,020
didn't know about that until procurement

726
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:48,199
identified that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vp was putting the</font>

727
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,910
dropbox on a credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then gave</font>

728
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,590
access to those five thousand users so

729
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,520
they vendors need to get paid right so

730
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,810
here are a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you may</font>

731
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,270
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider as you're trying to</font>

732
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,679
identify your

733
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:00,070
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is scoping so anybody</font>

734
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,770
who's actually performed this type of

735
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,710
third-party assessment knows if you just

736
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,610
go send out a spreadsheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions</font>

737
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,930
you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

738
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">never going to get the response you want</font>

739
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,190
so being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to scope what kind of data</font>

740
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,530
is being provided to your third parties

741
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,480
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being stored in software and</font>

742
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,710
then scoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the appropriate questions</font>

743
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,970
as part of the assessment becomes

744
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:26,420
absolutely critical to getting

745
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:28,640
compliance and then people don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

746
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,790
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your questions right we see</font>

747
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,230
situations where large companies are

748
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,300
using cloud providers and it's awesome

749
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's near free they're spending</font>

750
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,290
a thousand dollars on a contract and

751
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,340
this marketing groups are the best at

752
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,170
this right so they'll pick up a

753
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,030
marketing app they spend a fat you know

754
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:46,070
maybe even five hundred dollars and then

755
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,540
they send all of your customers

756
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,030
information to that marketing

757
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,340
application right and so this becomes a

758
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,920
critical vendor and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

759
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,649
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go assess that vendor and you</font>

760
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,940
say but you have all our critical data

761
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,560
they say we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come on site and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

762
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,210
an assessment and they look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and</font>

763
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,129
they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to themselves wait a second</font>

764
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,110
you want me to go spend ten thousand

765
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,550
dollars to support what you're getting

766
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,800
for five hundred dollars and it breaks

767
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,990
right so organizations really need to

768
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size of the</font>

769
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,930
contract versus the type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that</font>

770
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're sending to these organizations</font>

771
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,080
and whether you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

772
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,639
compliance and the fact that you need to

773
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">get information right in some cases</font>

774
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,380
spending more money becomes important

775
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,510
especially when vendors are getting

776
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,440
sensitive data so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all the</font>

777
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,150
types of things you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to think</font>

778
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're you're really starting</font>

779
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get a lot better regulatory coverage</font>

780
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,290
or more regulatory coverage around

781
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,740
managing your third-party relationships

782
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:41,810
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> work with a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people and we say</font>

783
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,580
when was the last time you dump the

784
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,710
vendor when was the last time you exited

785
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,600
a contract oh we<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

786
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,580
like five years why well that becomes

787
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,169
part of the requirement because in some

788
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,000
cases the people that use today can't

789
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,160
actually manage the security controls

790
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,710
that you need them to write at in a

791
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost-effective way so this is this has</font>

792
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:03,460
become some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

793
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:06,620
seeing out there and I love this quote

794
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was something that somebody shared</font>

795
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,998
assessments had<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or we are you</font>

796
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,799
will

797
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,049
to accept the cost of non-compliance

798
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,819
right and the business has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font>

799
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,739
to sign off at some point your<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams</font>

800
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,959
can't actually remove all of the risk

801
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:20,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so a business owner a senior</font>

802
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:22,049
executives got to sign off on it if

803
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:25,019
they're not willing to do that don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

804
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:26,519
the vendor you're a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations</font>

805
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:27,779
we talked about shared assessments if

806
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,879
you if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not part of shared</font>

807
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,949
assessments i would i would definitely

808
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:33,899
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know become a member or look</font>

809
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:37,649
at it as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

810
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:40,559
strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will be so this this year at</font>

811
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:42,359
the summit<font color="#E5E5E5"> i spoke twice but we really</font>

812
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,799
are looking to make sure that it's not

813
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,879
just financial services shared

814
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,519
assessments start in the financial

815
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:48,928
services industry but today members you

816
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,059
know some of the largest retailers in

817
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:52,259
the world some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest education</font>

818
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,149
facilities in the world are becoming

819
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:55,469
members and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

820
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:57,448
a major topic as part of your

821
00:29:55,469 --> 00:29:58,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity strategy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

822
00:29:57,449 --> 00:30:00,809
you may may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be part of the cloud</font>

823
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,519
security lines they're doing fantastic

824
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:04,559
work around<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party risk management</font>

825
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,459
they have a questionnaire they have some

826
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,319
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to really consider so just</font>

827
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:12,299
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about shared assessments it</font>

828
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,209
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the major banks today</font>

829
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:16,799
there's over a hundred and twenty

830
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,569
members and then there's probably about

831
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,149
two thousand organizations that use the

832
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:24,209
content so if you've already received a

833
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:25,918
questionnaire the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cig that comes from</font>

834
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:31,249
the shared assessments community and

835
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:34,379
it's a group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> members</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so last year</font>

836
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:36,719
just going to last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> I chaired the</font>

place right are you guys familiar with

845
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:56,099
the vb sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if you're</font>

847
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,839
but it's a very in-depth approach of

848
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:02,729
looking at the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with the</font>

maturity of your application providers

850
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:06,719
we said we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to tone that</font>

down a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to about</font>

00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're doing the right</font>

855
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,749
things and that's what we developed last

856
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,729
year with those organizations and it's

857
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:19,229
now part of the shared assessments

858
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:21,530
standardized information gathering

859
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:23,810
questionnaire or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sig</font>

860
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,490
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would I would definitely take a</font>

861
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,629
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of the service</font>

862
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,080
providers in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be getting</font>

863
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:33,200
these so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love your feedback on that we</font>

864
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,629
also to the regulatory requirement that

865
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,980
you may have so I so has become the

866
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,660
standard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we primarily map around</font>

867
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,170
but we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI coverage HIPAA</font>

868
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,560
coverage and you know we've also the

869
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:48,200
members as they bring more requirements

870
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,700
in its all member developed so things

871
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,670
like application security hardware

872
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,320
security cloud mobile are all part of

873
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sig today and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font>

874
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">membership itself has any I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

875
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,830
if any of you actually have gone on site

876
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,830
at your vendors to anybody here do

877
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:05,510
on-site assessment yeah so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

878
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,129
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do on-site assessment well if you</font>

879
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,930
ever been involved in that right so you

880
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,490
do your you send a cig it sent a

881
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,650
questionnaire you determine gosh I

882
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,360
that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should go on site</font>

883
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,040
from my you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

884
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,770
risk vendors and then you go well what

885
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,020
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do the AUP is the agreed-upon</font>

886
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,180
procedures was set up in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

887
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,190
you a framework and a guide in order to

888
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,200
determine what you actually do when you

889
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,420
go on site to a vendor and how to

890
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,580
evaluate them right a lot of people

891
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,430
outsource their evaluations to you know

892
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,230
some of the big four like KPMG etc they

893
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,550
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is about KPMG sits on the</font>

894
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,280
steering committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can ask them</font>

895
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,600
about the eight using the AUP instead of

896
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,370
some of the sock reporting that you may

897
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,919
get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise and this has become a</font>

898
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,929
really big part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some large banks</font>

899
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:51,530
programs and again give you that roadmap

900
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,700
for on-site assessment the last thing

901
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,990
that we looked at from a shared

902
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,430
assessments is the last part about my

903
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,720
last plug 4shared assessment is

904
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,290
something called the vendor risk

905
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,790
management maturity model I know I found

906
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants a tough one it's also called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

907
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,540
room right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I like that a little</font>

908
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">better try to come up with really nice</font>

909
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,590
acronyms for everything that we do I

910
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,570
like this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room what the room</font>

911
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,070
does is does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody use CMMI zai</font>

912
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,470
maturity model have you heard of that

913
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so this is sort of like a CMMI</font>

914
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,720
model for looking at third<font color="#E5E5E5"> party vendor</font>

915
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,189
maturity and it covers off on about

916
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,400
eight different domains including

917
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,410
governance policy what tools to use how

918
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,270
to budget and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

919
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,280
because what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is we</font>

920
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually take this and we can look at</font>

921
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,149
where we are in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our maturity we</font>

922
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,209
can

923
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:39,439
mark our maturity and in particular just

924
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,450
sent a report out last week which

925
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,039
actually had 450 companies where we can

926
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,629
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how mature we are and</font>

927
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,950
benchmark that against other

928
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:50,299
organizations in our industry we

929
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,589
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have taken this and something</font>

930
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:53,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you may be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in is</font>

931
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:54,408
something called a vendor risk maturity

932
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:55,879
assessment we actually use this to

933
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,070
develop this and we can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your</font>

934
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:59,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization and start giving you</font>

935
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,849
guidance on how to look at third party

936
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:03,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk management so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the framework</font>

937
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:05,119
that we've developed so it really

938
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:07,879
revolves around assessment how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

939
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,168
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scale an assessment and that</font>

940
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:12,319
really revolves like we talked about run

941
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:15,859
the content the policy automation how do

942
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:17,299
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at third party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oversight and</font>

943
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:19,250
that really revolves around SLA

944
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:21,049
management contract management etc right

945
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,760
so these have<font color="#E5E5E5"> become the really big</font>

946
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:25,520
topics are we actually getting

947
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,929
performance and then are they actually

948
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,619
doing what we require from a security

949
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:31,909
perspective monitoring has become a also

950
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:34,010
a major topic of all the regulatory

951
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:35,419
coverage and this is hard I haven't

952
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,220
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen anybody doing this</font>

953
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:39,020
effectively I 21 customer they're like

954
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:40,368
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if we have a vendor we're just</font>

955
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,409
going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a questionnaire every</font>

956
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:44,899
month and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do</font>

957
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,579
monitor and it just doesn't work so you

958
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,710
know we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> started developing models at</font>

959
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:50,450
prevalent to help with how do you get to

960
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do you monitor those third-party</font>

961
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:53,719
relationships how do you get those to

962
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,919
scale and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get response and</font>

963
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">then as we talked about in that case</font>

964
00:34:54,918 --> 00:35:00,200
it's going to happen right third parties

965
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,849
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get breached third parties</font>

966
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,500
that have your data are going to get

967
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,369
breached and then how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> respond to</font>

968
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's a much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different experience than</font>

969
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:11,569
delivering you know driving your cert

970
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,279
team to manage us you know manage a

971
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:16,130
response and so I really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

972
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about what are you prepared when</font>

973
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">your third party says we had an incident</font>

974
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,160
it's a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> different experience than</font>

975
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:26,210
trying to deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yourself from a</font>

976
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,710
security perspective I talked to a lot

977
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,210
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last day and a half</font>

978
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,829
around what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your what are your</font>

979
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,089
challenges and people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really focused</font>

980
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:34,460
on application security whether it be

981
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:36,259
internally or externally everybody's

982
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,579
using different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of libraries that</font>

983
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,049
are developed externally they're

984
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:40,180
integrating that into their applications

985
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:42,049
or they're using off-the-shelf

986
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,848
applications that they're integrating

987
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:45,230
into their platforms right so here's a

988
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,779
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we developed for really</font>

989
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,369
looking at third<font color="#E5E5E5"> party applications from</font>

990
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,799
vendors

991
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:52,240
how to manage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the first thing is</font>

992
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:54,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask the questions around</font>

993
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,799
whether they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process what's their</font>

994
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,049
process and and there's some tools out

995
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:00,910
here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

996
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:03,099
know happy to talk through that later we

997
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,049
actually integrate with some providers

998
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,150
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vera code and the nice part</font>

999
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:09,038
about Vera code anybody use very code of

1000
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,809
you ever heard of this it very codes

1001
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,730
awesome right because what you can do is

1002
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:15,910
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at doing static</font>

1003
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,650
based code analysis with binaries right

1004
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,999
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually they have a program</font>

1005
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,609
for vendors where they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1006
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">upload their binaries they can show you</font>

1007
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,880
potential flaws and software against the

1008
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,649
policy you define and then you can

1009
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">upload that into you can look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1010
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">and identify do they meet my</font>

1011
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,629
requirements against my policy and then

1012
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can start getting a sense for</font>

1013
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,019
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use the application and</font>

1014
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,099
then lastly you know integrating into

1015
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:40,598
our platform I'm not here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to necessarily</font>

1016
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,190
pitch prevalent but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

1017
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,259
waterfall effect of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1018
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,249
identify how data is flowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

1019
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:48,130
your data supply chain and the

1020
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:49,720
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are housing though we</font>

1021
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,769
solve this problem as we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1022
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple different ways we have</font>

1023
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:54,939
compliance assessment that's what you

1024
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:56,710
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking the vendor what</font>

1025
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,900
they're providing a lot of times people

1026
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,609
go we can't believe our vendors can't

1027
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,259
believe what they've provided and that's

1028
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:04,420
why technical monitoring being able to

1029
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:07,599
deliver against things like Vera code

1030
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:10,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualis fortify being able to take those</font>

1031
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,829
types of scan results and tie them to

1032
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,690
the assessment becomes critical and then

1033
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,519
lastly that monitoring component looking

1034
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,559
at external<font color="#E5E5E5"> information whether it be</font>

1035
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,058
financial information operational risk

1036
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,499
brand information and tying it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1037
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:21,579
together to get visibility so that's a

1038
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:23,499
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework that we put</font>

1039
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:25,779
together for assessment oversight

1040
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:27,220
monitoring and response and here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1041
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:28,690
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we see in a good program</font>

1042
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,558
where you may you know to get to scale

1043
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,930
these are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really</font>

1044
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:34,690
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about a couple of</font>

1045
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,279
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendations a lot of people try</font>

1046
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do assessment after you've already</font>

1047
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:40,059
signed a contract it's the wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1048
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,460
you got to assess vendors and assess the

1049
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:44,650
relationships before you purchase

1050
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,210
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of leverage you</font>

1051
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,759
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about what your</font>

1052
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,309
program looks like to get the scale and

1053
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:52,329
then start<font color="#E5E5E5"> really identifying what are</font>

1054
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:54,819
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do to</font>

1055
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:58,230
help scope you know get get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale</font>

1056
00:37:54,819 --> 00:38:01,990
help with monitoring as we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1057
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:04,000
and then lastly this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is becoming much</font>

1058
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,680
broader all the organizations we're

1059
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
talking to are getting away from just

1060
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,540
assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's making them a much</font>

1061
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:14,800
broader because today again its sales

1062
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:16,690
and and design that's all organizations

1063
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,280
are looking to do today everything else

1064
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,590
gets outsourced so thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

1065
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,610
you remain relevant or and again talking

1066
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a lot of people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to</font>

1067
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,850
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into our industry thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1068
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,130
you remain relevant in that environment

1069
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,810
becomes critical and I look at third

1070
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">party risk is a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really strong way</font>

1071
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:38,170
to do that and last<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to integrate</font>

1072
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:40,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shaka again but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is hard right and</font>

1073
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,930
what you all do is extraordinarily

1074
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,970
important right we look at people's

1075
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,470
health information this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is life and</font>

1076
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,649
death death stuff right we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1077
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,450
doctors but when we look at people being

1078
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to operate health systems covered</font>

1079
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,919
entities banking information this is

1080
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,910
really really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's really</font>

1081
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard so keeping up the press I</font>

1082
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,779
have it I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't know if it</font>

1083
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,190
stands for anything but making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1084
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,840
you've got you know really good coverage

1085
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,760
around third party risk and as part of

1086
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,000
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity strategy is really</font>

1087
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,810
important so before we sign off here any

1088
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,810
any questions
