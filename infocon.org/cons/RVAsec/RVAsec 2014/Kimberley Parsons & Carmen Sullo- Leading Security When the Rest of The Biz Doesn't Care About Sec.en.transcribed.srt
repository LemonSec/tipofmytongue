00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,500
introduction my name is Kimberly Parsons

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:09,460
advocate at heart although I masquerade

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:13,240
as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> HR kind of person I really have a</font>

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,309
passion for people and for teams I have

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,990
some coaching certifications it's part

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,790
of my profession and I don't like having

25
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,070
this passion for people in teams just

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,260
because I love people in teams it's all

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,210
about helping people in teams to work

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,980
together more effectively to accomplish

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,300
greater business results because at the

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,060
end of the day right that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,729
to work is to have great business

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:48,300
results so Karmin do you want to

33
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:50,350
introduce yourself hey leave Wow so

34

we're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> working out the mike</font>

35
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,020
situation that seems a little loud but

36
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,750
my name is Carmen Sulu my background

37
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,369
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an IT and also in business I've</font>

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,729
had a lot of experience in working with

39
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:07,990
in both business project teams and IT

40
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:09,519
teams and coming together with GE in

41
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,569
capital one and some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> places as</font>

42
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:15,760
well my passion is really around growing

43
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,319
people and teams I just think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,090
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do the software that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

45
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,040
build the things that with the

46
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,260
capabilities that we build our great but

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,260
for me it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about bringing people</font>

48
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,090
together

49
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,040
to show the best possible versions of

50
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,099
themselves and inspire the best possible

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,189
versions of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they lead</font>

52
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:35,988
and I care a lot about fostering<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

53
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,629
values-based leadership culture it's the

54
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,980
way that I approach leadership is what

55
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,690
do we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about and what brings</font>

56
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,349
us together I think that's going to come

57
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:50,450
through today sorry card do you want me

58
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:52,099
to go get<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you so um actually</font>

59
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,048
I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the introduction kind of</font>

60
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,760
part but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

61
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,849
got that out of the way let's actually

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,319
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we're here for today so</font>

63
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:01,879
leading<font color="#E5E5E5"> security when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

64
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,138
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't care about security so</font>

65
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,040
when Carmen and I were actually coming

66
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:09,560
up with this topic we did some little

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,709
check-ins we reached out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font>

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:17,500
colleagues professionals at different

69
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:21,409
company so rather than teeth is GE

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,450
Capital One<font color="#CCCCCC"> Markel a couple other places</font>

71
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,069
and we got some feedback from<font color="#E5E5E5"> people we</font>

72
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,440
said hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question that we</font>

73
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,629
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked them we said in your</font>

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,400
experience what is one area in project

75
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:33,138
delivery that could be more effective in

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> partnership between security and</font>

77
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:40,750
project teams so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read what you</font>

78
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys actually said first so thank you i</font>

79
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,419
exceeded my goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two cards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

80
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">have three that's awesome so communicate</font>

81
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:53,329
early so that is a challenge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

82
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,370
guys have actually said is a challenge

83
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,470
when actually delivering projects so I'm

84
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,819
guessing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is somewhere around maybe</font>

85
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:03,349
there's a lack of communicating early

86
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:06,108
requirement it's one word and it has a

87
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,578
star by it so okay requirements is maybe

88
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,879
a concern a challenge when we're

89
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:15,049
actually delivering projects okay last

90
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that I had huh including security at</font>

91
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:20,959
the beginning of the project plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as</font>

92
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:26,510
an afterthought so my clapper for that

93
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:32,270
oh my gosh<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so a lot of energy</font>

94
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:34,590
and passion around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have one</font>

95
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,219
more thank you sir I appreciate it

96
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,469
I've got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> here too I've got</font>

97
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,250
project teams do not at all that's in

98
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,200
caps consider security when they deploy

99
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:51,990
projects this causes friction and delays

100
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:54,930
in deployment include a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kappa</font>

101
00:04:51,990 --> 00:05:00,630
application info security and solution

102
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,890
design decisions discussions sorry the

103
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">handwriting was really actually quite</font>

104
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,770
good security is still a bolt on two

105
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:14,190
projects security context is not present

106
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:16,020
with project team need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to better</font>

107
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,050
understand or determine security

108
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,900
requirements up front project focused

109
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,490
security assessment<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok good so a lot of</font>

110
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,289
the same things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you guys are coming</font>

111
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with so it looks like you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

112
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,460
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right talk we appreciate you</font>

113
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,010
coming great we also wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

114
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,900
with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the feedback that we got so</font>

115
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,820
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually went to people that were on</font>

116
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,979
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side of the table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right that</font>

117
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,710
we consider project teams and just

118
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,100
sharing a quick snippet of what they

119
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,900
actually said so first one here

120
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,120
sometimes the security team get so

121
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,739
focused on a potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk that they</font>

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,270
lose sight of the value that the effort

123
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,380
will bring it would be good for the

124
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,000
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a good</font>

125
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,590
understanding of the business case so

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the cost of added security can be</font>

127
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,560
weighed against both the risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

128
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,150
benefits of the project it's also

129
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,860
beneficial to have the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

130
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,280
engaged in a project as early as

131
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,630
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> South bigger so that if there</font>

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">are security needs that should be</font>

133
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,300
addressed they are identified early

134
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,740
enough in a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the</font>

135
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,710
necessary steps to implement the

136
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution at my company we basically had</font>

137
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,620
no involvement with information security

138
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,890
in fact I don't even know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it exists</font>

139
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,450
hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> parenthesis I mean I'm sure it does</font>

140
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,250
but we never had<font color="#E5E5E5"> any security</font>

141
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,190
requirements or anything we heard the

142
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,360
theme of requirements right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

143
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest thing I've struggled with is</font>

144
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,420
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the security folks</font>

145
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,070
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for in terms of risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel</font>

146
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,690
like if I had a better idea where<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

147
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,580
heads were I could not only answer their

148
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,200
questions better but perhaps even offer

149
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,120
information that they didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

150
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,909
ask based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge of the</font>

151
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,420
situation it's all about context did you

152
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,570
have a context car at Karma

153
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,860
okay we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear from security until</font>

154
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,510
we're about to release and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

155
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,310
find flaws and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have time to</font>

156
00:06:52,510 --> 00:07:00,210
react it feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they show up at the</font>

157
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:02,650
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to disrupt delivery huh okay</font>

158
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,210
ensuring that information security is an

159
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,400
embedded part of the project delivery

160
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,979
lifecycle often is an afterthought or

161
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:16,900
final checkpoint that leads to rework or

162
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:18,790
sub optimal solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm ok so I'm</font>

163
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,979
hearing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> themes from</font>

164
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,960
what you guys did versus if we're

165
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,730
sitting across from our counterparts at

166
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,919
this imaginary table so a lot of the

167
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,960
same things that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up going on</font>

168
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,480
here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question really is like</font>

169
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really a case</font>

170
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,860
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't appreciate</font>

171
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,359
security where they don't value<font color="#E5E5E5"> it where</font>

172
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,940
maybe they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know that people</font>

173
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,660
exist on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security team somewhere is</font>

174
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,400
that really the issue well Carmen and I

175
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,080
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our presentation today we actually</font>

176
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,030
submit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what it really</font>

177
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,390
doesn't matter if the business does not

178
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:55,719
value security there is a change that we

179
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,870
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect as security professionals</font>

180
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,720
right what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going on is there is</font>

181
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,670
a misalignment between what we call a

182
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,710
team essentials so the security team is

183
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,060
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it from one perspective the</font>

184
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,489
project teams are<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming at it from</font>

185
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,640
another perspective which is impacting

186
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,070
how effectively we are actually

187
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,710
delivering our results as a team as a

188
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,500
company so there's a misalignment

189
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,659
between the team essentials that's going

190
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,370
on its cover you want to share maybe

191
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,930
with the team essentials are before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

192
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,430
move forward yeah so I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

193
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">of begs the question if there's a</font>

194
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,130
misalignment of the team essentials what

195
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,079
are these mysterious team essentials

196
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,640
basically we look at teams operating

197
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,190
when teams are operating really

198
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,790
effectively their operating really well

199
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,970
across these axes and we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at look at</font>

200
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:53,290
them as our four keys the people process

201
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:56,830
product and and purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I read out</font>

202
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> order my bad so people I think we</font>

203
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,470
tend to think of that is the humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

204
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,810
are

205
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,030
cheeks and seats right but it's also all

206
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills the capabilities that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font>

207
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:10,030
on a particular team<font color="#E5E5E5"> as all the stuff</font>

208
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the capability</font>

209
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,189
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capacity to do the work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

210
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,140
said we were going to do purpose is all

211
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,990
about what are we here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what did we</font>

212
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,480
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> together to deliver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems</font>

213
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,580
pretty obvious but<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we think about</font>

214
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,110
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the team level there's a team</font>

215
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,240
level of our purpose and what the

216
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,340
organizational purpose is and sometimes

217
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,990
there's a direct correlation and

218
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,660
sometimes we have to work at that

219
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,120
correlation to when we talk about

220
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,610
product that's really what is it that

221
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,830
we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in</font>

222
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,390
really service based industries and a

223
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,550
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> might sound a little bit of a</font>

224
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,949
like a head scratcher but we are trying

225
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deliver something right we're here to</font>

226
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,810
deliver its software deliver a project

227
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,790
whatever it is that we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font>

228
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,280
in product comes all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

229
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,170
use to measure the goodness of the thing

230
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,240
that we're delivering it's the quality

231
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,729
of the product it's the timeliness<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

232
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,980
the product and those types of things we

233
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,050
put all performance metrics and goals I

234
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how do we measure the goodness of</font>

235
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,750
that product in there and then the

236
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,780
fourth one is process process is a big

237
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">12 process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really covers all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

238
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,630
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which we in which we</font>

239
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,400
work together whether they're formalized

240
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,250
processes sometimes we have really

241
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,110
formal rigor roles and responsibilities

242
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,330
and sometimes they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

243
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,030
communication processes the things that

244
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,430
we're doing that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of informal we</font>

245
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:39,579
just know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all</font>

246
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,280
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things go into what we call the</font>

247
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:48,040
team essentials for what what builds a

248
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,209
really effective team so now we talked

249
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,640
about what builds a really effective

250
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,800
team and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I heard a lot on</font>

251
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,449
the feedback that we got from some

252
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,910
business partners as well as on the

253
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:03,070
cards that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we received was this idea of</font>

254
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:05,520
they this we this them I don't really

255
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,680
know what they want I don't really know

256
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,010
when they want us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in things like</font>

257
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's a day then thing so I kind</font>

258
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,870
of wonder

259
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,280
when we're operating and when we're

260
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,540
wondering whether or not there's a good

261
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,819
alignment those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are team feel like two</font>

262
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,300
completely separate themes where we're

263
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,550
operating on completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font>

264
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,569
measurements across those four team

265
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:34,579
essentials where they have a particular

266
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,740
purpose I might not even know what it is

267
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to mention be able to tell if it's</font>

268
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:43,390
aligned so I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's really the</font>

269
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:47,720
cost of trying to deliver in this way

270
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:50,510
and then what is becomes possible when

271
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,490
we start delivering in this way and when

272
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,230
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> say what becomes possible what</font>

273
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,060
becomes possible and the quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

274
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,310
products that we deliver but also what

275
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,650
becomes<font color="#CCCCCC"> prop possible in terms of the</font>

276
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">leadership that we show up with when</font>

277
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:11,510
we're really influencing the ability to

278
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:13,490
operate this way so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a look at</font>

279
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide and we actually take the</font>

280
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,640
feedback that we got from business

281
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:21,410
partners earlier right we categorized it

282
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,689
into where there could be a misalignment

283
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,370
and along the vectors of our team

284
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,960
essentials and I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we did</font>

285
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,710
this same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

286
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,510
all gave us like we could slot it

287
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,100
somewhere we could slide the cars that

288
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,350
you guys gave us<font color="#E5E5E5"> under one of the four</font>

289
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,900
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we actually have right so</font>

290
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,750
again as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carmen mentioned right there</font>

291
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,980
there is this sense of well I have a

292
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,410
purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't have a preference</font>

293
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,450
my purpose is<font color="#E5E5E5"> security I don't know your</font>

294
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,910
purpose might be this but my purpose of

295
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,400
security well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our purpose when</font>

296
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,540
we actually come together right our

297
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,640
process is um maybe we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

298
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,130
requirements up front near process is

299
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,510
maybe we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give them requirements</font>

300
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,550
at the end well what would be a

301
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,069
commonality what would be a combined

302
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:10,579
process that we all as the delivery team

303
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:12,080
can actually utilize in order to get to

304
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,640
a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both comfortable</font>

305
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,020
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirement process so again</font>

306
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,000
everything as you guys said everything

307
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we heard on prior to this session</font>

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,779
can be reflected back as a misalignment

309
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,859
in the 4p

310
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:33,339
so you all came to us for a reason right

311
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,069
and the hope is that you're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

312
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:39,009
in your head<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense maybe there was a</font>

313
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:40,990
misalignment between one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team</font>

314
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,879
essentials on projects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've found</font>

315
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,410
challenging or maybe I'm working in an

316
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,910
organization where I feel like I'm

317
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to leave security but the rest of</font>

318
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,240
the organization doesn't care about

319
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,859
security well then my question to you

320
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,399
all is where do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

321
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:58,480
misalignment in either purpose product

322
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,670
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> or process so here's the really</font>

323
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,949
interactive part of the day you guys did

324
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,199
awesome on the car so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thus far</font>

325
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:08,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to be great too as you all</font>

326
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,359
should have received a worksheet so

327
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:13,720
here's the challenge is for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

328
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,410
about a challenging project a

329
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,939
challenging effort that is going on

330
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">either right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now in your organization or</font>

331
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:24,309
has happened in the past write something

332
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,720
to make you say gosh darn it the

333
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:27,939
business doesn't care about security

334
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,290
here because of this on that particular

335
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:35,050
project so bring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to mine and</font>

336
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,550
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an example of that don't get</font>

337
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,930
so caught up in your visualization that

338
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,779
you start taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out on your neighbor</font>

339
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,599
that's sitting next to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so bring</font>

340
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that back up and what we'd have you do</font>

341
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,240
is on that worksheet is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that</font>

342
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:52,750
first question as up there so how

343
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,600
aligned were you on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team essentials</font>

344
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,829
so just think about whatever project

345
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,399
that's your visualize and then go

346
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:03,189
through each one people process product

347
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,860
purpose do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like there were</font>

348
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:09,639
strong alignment moderate alignment or a

349
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:13,600
low level of alignment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are going</font>

350
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:16,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you will check the box on something</font>

351
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,069
you will check the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something jot</font>

352
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:21,040
down whatever notes whatever comes to

353
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:23,498
mind that makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay we had a</font>

354
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,050
low alignment because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> XY and Z so</font>

355
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:31,120
take those notes there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we will</font>

356
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:33,969
give you four minutes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 45</font>

357
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes to do that let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me just add one</font>

358
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:39,279
thing if you're wondering I don't even

359
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,870
know what my<font color="#E5E5E5"> business units purpose is</font>

360
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,730
I don't know what their processes are

361
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,620
the answer is you have low enlightenment

362
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,550
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you're</font>

363
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:57,160
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not aligned on it that help</font>

364
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:59,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so thank you for taking a few</font>

365
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,649
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually fill that in</font>

366
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:05,290
question is any insights anything stand

367
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,410
out to you anybody have low alignment on

368
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:11,980
all four of their categories it's okay

369
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you do no judgment anybody found high</font>

370
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,290
alignment on all four of their

371
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:22,300
categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one person awesome we</font>

372
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:27,120
want to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> there okay Amy thoughts and</font>

373
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,109
questions in doing that activity

374
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually when I was walking around I</font>

375
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,980
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of different things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

376
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:36,040
one of them was around where certain

377
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,699
things belong sdlc for example where

378
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,748
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that belong in our conversation</font>

379
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,459
generally I would think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that as</font>

380
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:45,490
part of process it's part of the way

381
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:48,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do work but also think about you</font>

382
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,379
know when we say sdlc what does sdlc me

383
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,240
for me it's a software delivery life

384
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:55,959
cycle but for some people that's a

385
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,980
security delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> life cycle and you can</font>

386
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,180
tell that I'm already kind of

387
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,189
head-scratching because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not really</font>

388
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,979
that familiar with it which<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggests a</font>

389
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:05,438
low alignment another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed a</font>

390
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,849
lot of as I was walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with some</font>

391
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,370
head scratching around I don't really

392
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,678
know what to put here because I don't

393
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:15,398
<font color="#CCCCCC">even know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be nobody said</font>

394
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,490
this no judgment but it could be I don't

395
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:20,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">even know my team's purpose or I'm not</font>

396
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,169
even sure what my team's processes are

397
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:26,860
and that's valuable information to be

398
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:30,039
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about then the last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

399
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:32,320
also heard as we were walking around was

400
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:35,169
hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't really have a lot</font>

401
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,090
of influence over these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

402
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:40,690
don't want to I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to skew your</font>

403
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,399
data by putting things down and um these

404
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,059
handouts are for you it's not our data

405
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,709
so good news you're not skewing my data

406
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,908
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> influence isn't is an</font>

407
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,500
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be thinking about</font>

408
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,660
particularly when we're thinking about

409
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,730
later

410
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,760
so that brings us nicely to our next

411
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,610
slide so for thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those four</font>

412
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:08,020
team essentials and people and product

413
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:11,110
process and purpose how would we rank

414
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,480
the amount of impact we think each of

415
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">those that's not gonna work what's the</font>

416
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,700
impact we think having an alignment

417
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:22,809
would have on our ability to deliver

418
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,000
effectively together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also what level</font>

419
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,610
of influence do you feel you personally

420
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,340
have on being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needle of</font>

421
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,740
the alignment so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a lot of</font>

422
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,860
influence I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> think hey you know I</font>

423
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,020
can just come in and demand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

424
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,209
aligned on purpose I can come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

425
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,429
decide what this is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

426
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,640
a lot of influence i might be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

427
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:48,250
position<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says um you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> epicly</font>

428
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,710
receive this I don't really have a lot

429
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,780
of ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change this and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not just</font>

430
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,010
purpose it could be any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and this</font>

431
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,330
could be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every single one</font>

432
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,908
of every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of you in the room</font>

433
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">so let's take a minute if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can and</font>

434
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:03,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have this chart on your handout</font>

435
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so what I'd like you to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

436
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:10,539
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with each of those start with one</font>

437
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:13,090
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-team essentials and decide</font>

438
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:15,730
just generally there's no right or wrong

439
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:19,000
answer you will not get graded but where

440
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,250
do I feel like the impact is of this

441
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,610
particular team essential on our ability

442
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,919
to deliver more effectively and plot it

443
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,590
on the chart and then where do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

444
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,360
my personal influences on being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

445
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:35,320
impact the alignment of that particular

446
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,830
team essential so again if you just take

447
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,780
a moment take a guess a gut reaction of

448
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:45,908
where you feel like you are and jot that

449
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:48,840
down for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second I'd be fabulous you</font>

450
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,840
can also ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

451
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,950
alright so you've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute to kind</font>

452
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,350
of think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you would put these</font>

453
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,260
what's the point what's the point in

454
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:04,360
looking at this well to some degree it's

455
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,190
it has a lot to do with where do you

456
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,889
want it where do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to focus your</font>

457
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,000
effort and where is the biggest bang for

458
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,380
your buck going to be it's about

459
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,870
prioritizing right so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> using this as</font>

460
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,299
an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I think that I have a lot</font>

461
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,959
of impact and influence and influence

462
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:26,740
over process you know I can I can make

463
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,169
some some strong influencing I can

464
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,149
dictate a particular process or maybe i

465
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:33,190
can i can wrangle a team together<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

466
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:35,439
build some processes together that will

467
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,899
align the processes between security and

468
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
IT and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's going to have a high</font>

469
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:42,010
impact that might be the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

470
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,190
want to start I think I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on it</font>

471
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:49,539
independently and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring a</font>

472
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:52,090
big bang for my buck right requirements

473
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,039
came up over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so</font>

474
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,899
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about making sure that I have</font>

475
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:58,570
a really clear set of requirements that

476
00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:01,479
go into whatever your requirements

477
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,918
repository is or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there</font>

478
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,710
could be some really great low hanging

479
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,809
fruit in there that we can get great

480
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,659
impact on initially the second thing I

481
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,519
might shoot for is when I have a high

482
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:14,769
influence on but maybe not the best

483
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,929
impact because i know i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get those</font>

484
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:20,019
quickly and when i get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work done</font>

485
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:22,659
quickly and i start influencing quickly

486
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:24,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">i start creating some communication and</font>

487
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:27,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">i start creating some dialogue right and</font>

488
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:30,129
this starts to create a model for<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we</font>

489
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,630
might interact differently this is a way

490
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we demonstrate our personal</font>

491
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,399
leadership across our teams that helps

492
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,610
to influence the leaders on our teams to

493
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:42,580
also step up and do more of the same

494
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:44,918
that's a great second place to start the

495
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,260
third place to start that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font>

496
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,590
place to delegate so if I've got people

497
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,629
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know there's some impact there</font>

498
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,070
or low impact and I've got people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

499
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,690
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence that work for my team</font>

500
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,510
that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a great place to delegate</font>

501
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,190
to as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well another place I might look at</font>

502
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,860
is where there's high impact and low

503
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,659
influence this is a place where I don't

504
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,709
feel like I have there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I can</font>

505
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,890
do about this

506
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,169
however what I do know is i know people

507
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">who do have influence and those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

508
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go and communicate</font>

509
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,320
with I can schedule some time with and

510
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:19,720
we can come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a plan that will</font>

511
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,750
create the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact the impact that I'm</font>

512
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,149
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this is again a great way to</font>

513
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,770
show up in your personal leadership that

514
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:29,889
says hey you know I'm expanding my

515
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:34,750
sphere of influence and looking to

516
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,340
generate great impact here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now</font>

517
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys have actually done your</font>

518
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,870
mapping of this across influence and

519
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,470
impact the question is where would you

520
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:46,600
start so we're assuming that you guys

521
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,270
came because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave security</font>

522
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,678
within your business so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back let's</font>

523
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,510
say next week if you're actually going

524
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,549
back to the office where might you start

525
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,100
based off of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessment that you</font>

526
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,049
just did would it be if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was y'all's</font>

527
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,520
chart right one place that we would

528
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,559
suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you process</font>

529
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:07,450
another place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd start might be</font>

530
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:09,520
purpose so the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that sheet I</font>

531
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,860
believe in the gray box<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you</font>

532
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,360
what action can you take based off of

533
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,860
the mapping that you have right so do

534
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,439
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you like two minutes</font>

535
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,389
write down an action that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might take</font>

536
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,070
where would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start based off of yours</font>

537
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's been what is one step that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

538
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,020
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually go back next week</font>

539
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:35,940
and start leaving security start leaving

540
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:35,940
alignment within your company bless you

541
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,329
okay so it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like people are looking</font>

542
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:51,269
at me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that means that you're</font>

543
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:52,440
done as I always tell people look done

544
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,839
when you're done so you guys are looking

545
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,929
done so what I'd like for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

546
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:00,928
turn to a partner someone that's sitting

547
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,999
next to you have a conversation what is

548
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:05,009
that action first of all any insights

549
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:07,529
pop out for you based off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what your</font>

550
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:09,119
assessment has been and then what is

551
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,219
that action that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

552
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,109
take what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like you can</font>

553
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:15,779
influence where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel like having</font>

554
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:18,509
a higher alignment is going to be really

555
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">impactful for you all so again this is</font>

556
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:23,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">the part that's interactive you guys get</font>

557
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:26,939
to share with each other and maybe even

558
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:29,159
help you to dig deeper into what actions

559
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,409
you can take once you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

560
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,239
workplace so we'll give you like five

561
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:35,479
minutes to turn to a neighbor and have a

562
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,479
conversation

563
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:53,709
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so as we were walking</font>

564
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the room we um i like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ease</font>

565
00:24:53,710 --> 00:25:01,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop I don't know oh security conference</font>

566
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,150
so I kind of was eavesdropping a little

567
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,260
bit on some of the conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

568
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,420
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard some really good</font>

569
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,220
takeaways<font color="#CCCCCC"> and discussion points that</font>

570
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,490
people were bringing up and so want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

571
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,110
turn the floor over to you what are some

572
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,710
takeaways that you guys have that you

573
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:19,209
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about or some aha they came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

574
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,059
for you as you were having conversations

575
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,660
with your colleagues<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carmen's actually</font>

576
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:27,790
going to run a mic I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were</font>

577
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,140
goal oriented so let me set a goal how

578
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:35,470
about two people speak and then we'll

579
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:47,110
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we exceed that not afraid to call</font>

580
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:49,480
on people by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way pain in the back so</font>

581
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,760
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be honest that I'm struggling</font>

582
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this exercise and I'll give you an</font>

583
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,160
example of something that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

584
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,070
is happening at where I work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

585
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,850
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a team that needs to deploy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

586
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:06,210
product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in terms of purpose</font>

587
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:08,649
everyone agrees and would agree that the

588
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,059
product should be secure in its end

589
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,970
state because this is a product that's

590
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:16,210
going to be customer facing what happens

591
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,100
is we can come to some kind of agreement

592
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,350
we the security team can come to some

593
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,629
kind of agreement with the team of

594
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,760
developers that set that we can say yes

595
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,290
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> product should be secure here are</font>

596
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,290
some ways that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure it and</font>

597
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:31,270
then the product team has a deadline and

598
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,820
as the deadline looms closer and closer

599
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,070
they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh with deadlines looming we're</font>

600
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start taking shortcuts on where</font>

601
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,120
we go with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> product and at the end</font>

602
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,010
of the development cycle the product is

603
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,199
finished but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not secure to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

604
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,059
point that we agreed on before it was

605
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,480
deployed and if we go to management and

606
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:51,520
say hey this like this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure this</font>

607
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,169
isn't ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be customer facing the</font>

608
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,809
attitude we get is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care because</font>

609
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:58,549
to be launched it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on time so for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us I</font>

610
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:01,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the problem is really one of of</font>

611
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:04,279
culture so how do you change the culture

612
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:07,070
to make it so you know there's some kind

613
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,109
of enforcement on when we agree that

614
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">something needs to be secure and then it</font>

615
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:12,129
turns out that it isn't and then it gets

616
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,418
launched anyway and then it's like

617
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:16,189
eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to get owned and</font>

618
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:18,379
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on everyone in the</font>

619
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">company to be like well who didn't</font>

620
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:22,488
enforce this and then everyone has to

621
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:25,369
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah great thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

622
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:28,489
sharing and I'm definitely hearing a

623
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:30,590
misalignment that's going on where if I

624
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:32,749
asked you guys with the 4 p's where do

625
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,340
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like culturally there is a</font>

626
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:42,009
misalignment which<font color="#E5E5E5"> p would you guys</font>

627
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:49,158
think just yell it out process what else

628
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:50,690
people who's had people say more people

629
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:52,580
have a choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow the process or</font>

630
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,889
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of times processors are there</font>

631
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,439
but they get broken or over old look

632
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:59,869
eyes of the people and I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

633
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,929
probably what the biggest issue is the

634
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:05,600
Montes especially higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> level sea</font>

635
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,220
levels and executive levels that don't

636
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,988
necessarily have a security mindset and

637
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,080
they're making<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions for security</font>

638
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:14,659
yeah okay good thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I would also</font>

639
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,029
suggest product right so in the

640
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:19,220
beginning right you said we feel like we

641
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,529
felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we were all in agreement that</font>

642
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,929
this should be a secure product because

643
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's customer facing however at the end</font>

644
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:27,739
of the day your actions<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak louder</font>

645
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,330
than your words right until the actions

646
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,639
of being willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put something into</font>

647
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,320
production that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not to cure says to</font>

648
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:35,269
me that we were not really aligned

649
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,399
although our words that that we were and

650
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:39,259
so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bringing that up that a</font>

651
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,570
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this that we're talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

652
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,340
it is cultural is systemic and so that's

653
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,379
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we asked you a question of where do</font>

654
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,299
you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have influence because</font>

655
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:50,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the end of the day is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be you</font>

656
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:53,658
coming back and leading change leading

657
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:56,779
alignment within that particular area so

658
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:58,429
what I'm hearing sir from you in that it

659
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:00,049
sounds like that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a really</font>

660
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,629
big impact that we could get alignment

661
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:04,549
when having security built into our

662
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:06,889
products and actually making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

663
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,639
priority that's going to help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

664
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:11,510
tenfold

665
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,700
100 fold more effective great now the

666
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">question that I would ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

667
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,720
about is where do you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

668
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,070
influence in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that situation right is it</font>

669
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,890
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

670
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,139
manager if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you have</font>

671
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,030
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low level influence to impact change</font>

672
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,040
is that something<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can you reach out</font>

673
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,810
to is it your manager is it your

674
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,080
managers manager is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone on your</font>

675
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:34,460
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> partners team right because at</font>

676
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,350
the end of the day that's what this is

677
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do we actually start to</font>

678
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,490
move the needle on a cultural<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

679
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:42,490
because it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's embedded</font>

680
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:14,940
yeah yeah and so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

681
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,689
I say to that where are things as an IT

682
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,830
professional that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

683
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,990
maybe ask my<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see what their</font>

684
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,179
opinion is but I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I got really</font>

685
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,970
good at is speaking the same language so

686
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,840
if you came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and you feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

687
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,940
is a culture where it is hey what is the

688
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">NPV of me actually doing this then</font>

689
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,320
that's the language of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

690
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,670
suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you speak here is the value</font>

691
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,460
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all know about the target</font>

692
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,920
breach that happened right pull some

693
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,410
numbers show some data because if money

694
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,120
talks if money answers like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets</font>

695
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,220
things done within your organization

696
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,719
then speak that language right because

697
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you coming to me as a business</font>

698
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,590
professional as an executive and saying

699
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,720
hey security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important I may agree</font>

700
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,189
with you but if my culture is one where

701
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,230
I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the dollar figures that's</font>

702
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,850
associated with it then come to me and

703
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:07,550
speak that language you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my</font>

704
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:09,929
attention I<font color="#E5E5E5"> throwing it back thank you</font>

705
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:12,409
I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

706
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">question of buy-in actually it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

707
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:20,880
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a ambiguity if kind of a problem</font>

708
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:25,110
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> form just for my like a survey</font>

709
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,690
methodology perspective I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe if</font>

710
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:32,310
I'm right we might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a quick</font>

711
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">experiment to see how what kind of</font>

712
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,960
effect it might have I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems to</font>

713
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,290
me there's a bit of an ambiguity in the

714
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,450
term delivery effectiveness and what it

715
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:46,340
refers to if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people in the</font>

716
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:52,230
room here that personally identify with

717
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:56,010
the project team kind of role in this

718
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:59,100
scenario if anybody fits that

719
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:02,550
description how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel that</font>

720
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:06,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the term the delivery effectiveness</font>

721
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:12,770
actually refers to the project project

722
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:12,770
delivery effectiveness and a

723
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,200
if anybody actually just think about it

724
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">and those of you who identify with the</font>

725
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,440
security side how many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

726
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,880
interpret that delivery effectiveness to

727
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,250
delivery of security you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

728
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,160
of the security requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

729
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:34,280
supposed to be monitoring and

730
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:39,050
enforcement so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think actually the the</font>

731
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,899
form could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> read you know in good</font>

732
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:44,750
faith by parties who identify with

733
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and actually they might end up</font>

734
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:51,080
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> this same sort of things but the</font>

735
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:52,250
results could be quite ambiguous they

736
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,439
would actually be saying like the

737
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:59,780
opposite thank you I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

738
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,180
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good point another thing that we</font>

739
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,830
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clarify is you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

740
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,920
talk about the four-team essentials

741
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,659
these are big headers right so when we

742
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,520
go in we would we would do a much deeper

743
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,740
assessment at a much deeper level and

744
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,680
when we talk about like your comment

745
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,910
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting buy-in and you know they</font>

746
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,290
said that they cared and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

747
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,750
didn't care in the problem being at the

748
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:23,629
culture there is probably you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could tie</font>

749
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,790
that if we keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper there's a</font>

750
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:28,340
piece of that that reflects people right

751
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how committed they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are there's also</font>

752
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,320
a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that reflects process in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

753
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,470
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about is what</font>

754
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">are you getting rewarded for so when we</font>

755
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,910
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how do we influence in a way</font>

756
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,400
that we are really convincing people

757
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,020
that they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do care it's sort of</font>

758
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,080
influencing at the with them level

759
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:50,000
what's in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me so if I'm I project</font>

760
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,530
delivery person and my job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

761
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,750
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> delivered and at the end of</font>

762
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year I get a raise based on how many</font>

763
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,670
projects I delivered and it has nothing

764
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,899
to do with how secure they are then

765
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,190
that's what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

766
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,960
doesn't matter what I said at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

767
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,850
beginning of the project so then it

768
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,570
comes down having that conversation of

769
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:11,299
how do I get what this language in that

770
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">language in the language of and this</font>

771
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,130
makes your product delivery stronger

772
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:19,389
right and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's influencing in</font>

773
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:23,780
a space of showing up as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> leader to</font>

774
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:25,219
create leadership in others as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

775
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,570
would encourage you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about you</font>

776
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,770
know

777
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:31,450
although all those Peas what they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

778
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,310
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one other thing I would say is</font>

779
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:36,219
that to address<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting the</font>

780
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,830
buy-in of the the business side is not

781
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:40,659
to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process where even if the</font>

782
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,000
product is not you know if they say that

783
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:45,040
okay even I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care about security or</font>

784
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,139
you know the if the product is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on a</font>

785
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,330
person you know ready for you from your

786
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,909
point of view you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get there</font>

787
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,319
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know sign off on a paper piece of</font>

788
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,580
paper right wave<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like a released</font>

789
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,990
statement where they said yes I

790
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,810
understand that this is not how to

791
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:01,390
present secure but then as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is manager</font>

792
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,040
I'm agreeing for it once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the</font>

793
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,470
question of like a sign off on a paper

794
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,210
the business will think twice okay oh

795
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,669
this is where that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment ability comes</font>

796
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,890
right so that is where we fail many

797
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,510
companies the process where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font>

798
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,580
take the sign offs from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business to</font>

799
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,770
prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know whether it can be a</font>

800
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,810
defective product or even the security

801
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,730
problems anything right once you ask

802
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,560
them to put a signature on a paper to

803
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,600
say that you yes I am either of this

804
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,670
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then still I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

805
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,620
ahead with this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask that question</font>

806
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:34,060
that's when they back off from there you

807
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:36,339
can try<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all right thank you we</font>

808
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,259
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three minutes left so one</font>

809
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,150
quick comment last so you're quick

810
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,060
moment actually on this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

811
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:47,200
he just did was basically translate that

812
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:49,720
objection into a risk so take that risk

813
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,390
quantified that into a dollar value as

814
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,220
to what is the risk to them if they let

815
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,680
the product go with these deficiencies

816
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,720
and do get that sign off that means

817
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,210
they're accepting that risk which is

818
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay many businesses can accept the race</font>

819
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,340
there's no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that it's all</font>

820
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:09,430
about that language in peace right and I

821
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that that is a part of leading is</font>

822
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,169
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you languish things and package</font>

823
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,450
it together so that it people are able

824
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,190
to then respond accordingly based off of

825
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,020
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share I just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

826
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,810
kudos you guys exceeded my goal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

827
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:25,690
people speaking that was really awesome

828
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:28,990
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question for you to think</font>

829
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,880
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're walking away right how</font>

830
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,520
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually start taking those steps</font>

831
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,400
towards alignment what might be that one

832
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,850
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to take in order to</font>

833
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,280
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving the needle on this because</font>

834
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:43,500
again I admit this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably cultural</font>

835
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,710
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably some very systemic things</font>

836
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,950
that are there but if we never address

837
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:53,100
it then it always just will be so as

838
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:55,080
leaders in your profession how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

839
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,790
actually start to move the needle how do

840
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we start to say where is my place of</font>

841
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,600
leadership where is my place of

842
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,819
influence in this who can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

843
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,040
reach out to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me to influence</font>

844
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,790
this in order for us to start seeking

845
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,950
that greater alignment because our cases

846
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,080
as you start to lead more alignment

847
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,850
across the team essentials here what

848
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,220
will actually happen is you'll start to

849
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,410
increase the credibility of security

850
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,169
coming to the table you'll also start to

851
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,879
increase the value of security right

852
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,270
within the eyes of your business

853
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,040
partners so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your time</font>
