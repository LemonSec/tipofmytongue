1
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,340
so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is Ben I'm worked with this</font>

2
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,920
little company you might have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,480
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Garber I don't do magic quadrants</font>

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,460
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not in the magical thinking</font>

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,450
so try not to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me darts at me</font>

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,550
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dartboard talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here we're going</font>

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about risk risk man risk</font>

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,440
assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk analysis I through the</font>

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,710
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you know you</font>

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,769
gotta do and we can I'll reserve the

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,829
cyber jokes or this part of the heckling

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,220
crowd right over here so feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to</font>

13
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,080
toss<font color="#E5E5E5"> out questions along the way here</font>

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,879
this is what I call a skip the

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,519
appetizers and entrees go straight to

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,330
dessert talk so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the five</font>

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,110
recommendations right off the bat can

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,129
anybody see these no probably not I'm

19
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to step back a little bit so I can</font>

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,079
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> read my see my deck too so we</font>

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,270
did research in the last year early this

22
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,130
year and we talked to a lot of people

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">who said okay you're doing risk</font>

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,520
assessment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know doing risk analysis</font>

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,439
what frameworks are you using what tools

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,259
are you using and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you actually</font>

27
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,079
get down to being effective at what you

28
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,789
try to do here and it these are the five

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,729
recommendations that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up having</font>

30
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:30,350
at the end it's a rather than go through

31
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,969
like all the really boring research to

32
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,469
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that doesn't get</font>

33
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,759
you anywhere necessarily I just wanted

34
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:37,309
to jump right into this stuff and say

35
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,899
okay you<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably have harvested your</font>

36
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,950
risk management<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT risk management or</font>

37
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,909
technical risk management<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their</font>

38
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,409
organizations and you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

39
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,700
of how to make that better you may have

40
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:50,119
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where to start we get that</font>

41
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,329
a lot and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just tackle</font>

42
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,850
this how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you do risk assessment</font>

43
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:58,038
of risk analysis on a regular basis how

44
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,279
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you were maybe an auditor type</font>

45
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:05,450
folks how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you were more like IT</font>

46
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:09,228
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> er how many of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

47
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,348
developers a couple of you feel like I'm

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,599
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a pose</font>

49
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:15,189
Mike here so forgive<font color="#CCCCCC"> me um what else did</font>

50
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,238
I miss management anybody management

51
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:22,390
here I'll use smaller words<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

52
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,810
right did I miss any big topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

53
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,189
some industry wise financial services

54
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,409
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a couple folks education</font>

55
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,950
probably a few you know education<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

56
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:35,108
we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> VCU for crying out loud one</font>

57
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,738
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't either right uh what</font>

58
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:39,909
else manufacturing look at that will

59
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:42,940
forget about the vendors I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

60
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the vendors man what else do we</font>

61
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,780
need there's lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> under health care</font>

appreciate that not that you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

69
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,349
because it's in very small print at the

00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:03,909
bottom but you can ping me if you're

71

<font color="#CCCCCC">caffeine in those cans to ice on it to</font>

89
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,650
hurry so<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and foremost if you're</font>

90
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,769
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> under way with risk</font>

91
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,479
assessment risk analysis you got to have

92
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">some process in place and you're all</font>

93
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,970
you're probably like one nobody but with

94
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,510
what width process comes this very

95
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,489
important thing called context and

96
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">ironically context is what we end up</font>

97
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,659
missing and sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a bit of an eye</font>

98
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,190
chart hard to see up here but context is

99
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,750
the one thing that we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to skip over</font>

100
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,069
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time especially when we</font>

101
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,639
approach risk from a technical

102
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:15,488
organizations perspective a min order

103
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,918
here roughly if you could see it is the

104
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,060
diagram from iso 31000 anybody familiar

105
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,760
with iso 31000 so it's a guideline for

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">how did you risk management generically</font>

107
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,830
if you look at this you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,889
top box there is labeled context guess

109
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,570
what we don't typically do nine times

110
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,510
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tanning a lot of risk assessment</font>

111
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,700
activity or risk management processes we

112
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do context which is kind of</font>

113
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,960
problematic because if you notice

114
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,159
context then feeds into risk assessment

115
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,020
which then feeds into your risk

116
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,020
treatment or risk remediation program a

117
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,359
word on terminology before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go any more</font>

118
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,219
on this so risk management is your

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,570
overall process it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

120
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:00,700
decisions right let's make good

121
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,430
decisions to make better<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions risk</font>

122
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">assessment is the process of taking the</font>

123
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,080
context and then up mashing it up

124
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,700
essentially with some analysis

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,979
capabilities to say okay what are we

126
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually seeing in this given scenario</font>

127
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,650
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the actual details of</font>

128
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,849
this and then how does that map back to

129
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">my risk tolerance Mike risk of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pasley my</font>

130
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:23,469
risk appetite and especially for<font color="#E5E5E5"> margin</font>

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,000
investment perspective do I have an

132
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:27,400
aptitude type to take on more risk

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,919
because there might be upside and then

134
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,500
all of that comes together in that last

135
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,750
box or evaluation as a substep under

136
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,250
assessment and then feeds into you okay

137
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,400
now what do I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this what</font>

138
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,020
treatment find like a month worries so

139
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,448
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your overall risk management</font>

140
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,659
program you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice here see if I can</font>

141
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:50,520
use the magic red dot assessment that is

142
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:54,159
step two in this risk management process

143
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,770
is not step<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so you read all these</font>

144
00:05:54,159 --> 00:06:00,039

146
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,139
risk-based decisions well that's all

147
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,540
good and fine but if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

153
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,460
because you're going to be missing fifty

percent or more than actual data that

155
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,780
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a good informed</font>

158
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,090
under risk assessment and I'm a stickler

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,260
for terminology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like getting the words</font>

160
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,700
right because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think words are</font>

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:38,590
important in heaven uni and so

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">oftentimes i will stop people and say</font>

okay you're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word risk but</font>

164
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,000
you're describing a threat or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

describing a weakness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and vulnerability</font>

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,560
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really mean because if</font>

you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk where was the</font>

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,849
account for the impact of the business

170
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,670
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> often times fall out of</font>

unfortunately within technical security

173
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,730
crowd we tend to be really bad if it's

174
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,200
more likely if you go through the vendor

175
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,340
hall you know every single vendor in

176
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,890
there is probably going to throw the

177
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,440
word risk at you but you know sorry

178
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,990
phone scanners are not generally talking

<font color="#E5E5E5">about risk talking about phone or</font>

it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really match up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the kid</font>

the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of takeaway point here is that</font>

we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand this overall</font>

components now putting it into practice

190
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,020
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> could end up looking something like</font>

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,610
this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a draft of a guidance</font>

192

framework that were working on right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

193
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of takes that iso 31000 model</font>

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and puts it together and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

195
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,650
highlight here a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things right</font>

requirements when you start doing a risk

assessment right so again it's pulling

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,799
in that context information as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

200
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,440
defining this in there

201
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,650
that you're doing analysis against and

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,789
then structuring for success you know

203
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,030
one of the first things we like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,289
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing the triage we could talk</font>

205
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,090
about qualitative we can talk about

206
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,849
quantitative we talk about framers blah

207
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,008
blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> but first and foremost you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">website you should be able to</font>

215
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,200
intuitively make a decision based off of

216
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,000
a quick triage capability we'll talk

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,500
about this later as<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how you should</font>

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,700
route things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how much time and</font>

222
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,320
tend to be three different types of risk

223
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,269
assessments that you will often perform

224
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,519
within your organization what we most

225
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,260
often see is this one on the far right

226
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,649
here portfolio assessment those are your

227
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,120
annual risk assessments guess what those

228
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,190
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the least amount of value</font>

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,360
overall you say well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't be true</font>

230
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ben because we just did this risk</font>

231
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,140
assessment and it uncovered all sorts of

232
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,390
stuff an organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> true but what I'm here to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

234
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,010
you is that you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be doing</font>

235
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,140
smaller risk assessments on an ongoing

236
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,079
basis for almost all of your projects

237
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,149
you know and at regular check marks

238
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,219
throughout the year and rolling that up

239
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,170
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your annualized assessment because</font>

the last thing the business needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

241
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,599
more surprises as target is probably

242
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,449
very happy to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> after reading</font>

oops and you get through that through ad

248
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,310
hoc assessments and then we also talked

249
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,020
about tollgate assessments in this

250
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,399
framework tollgates would be so you got

251
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,140
a formalized project<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you're going</font>

256
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,529
on do a risk assessment or procurement

257
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:03,740
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are dealing with</font>

outsourcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cloud providers today is</font>

259
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,690
that a bit of a headache for you how

260
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,380
many how many of you have dealt with

261
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,640
procurement decisions being made

262

your data at risk and you're like wait a

minute time out there why are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

266
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,969
that did you actually consider the the

ramifications of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your decision here no</font>

268
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,730
and so what you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up having to do is</font>

269
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,530
you end up having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back to your</font>

occurs if you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that they have</font>

289
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,120
to change what they're doing oftentimes

290
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's that's where the process breakdown</font>

291
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,650
occurs so it's very key with your

292
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,420
processes and with your alignment one

293
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,390
other thing to consider here from a

294
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,699
contextual perspective is your context

295
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,400
as it comes in will also help define for

296
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,630
you what your context should look like

297
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:29,040
going out and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of bad</font>

298
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,760
output within this industry in

299
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,280
particular risk scoring and I don't see

300
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,260
him sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here with CBS s our</font>

301
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,079
favorite whipping boy for first scoring

302
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,450
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your CBS s score is a 7</font>

303
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,860
therefore you must go patch it oh it's

304
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">only a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five point six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay don't worry</font>

305
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,420
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's a medium whatever that</font>

306
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">means so there's a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of frameworks</font>

307
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,449
there's a lot of tools out there that

308
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,750
are happy to give you a magical number

309
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,000
your risk is 72 or you get the report in

310
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,550
its list of I have you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 high risk</font>

311
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,160
findings and you know 40 medium risk

312
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,370
findings and five billion low-risk

313
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,180
bindings that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't care about so gone</font>

314
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,950
but what does it mean where's the

315
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,150
context and you start digging at it you

316
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,910
start picking out that and drilling down

317
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,949
you're like um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you mean</font>

318
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,870
risk when you're saying risk it's like

319
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that scene out of a princess bride you</font>

320
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,510
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that word I do not think it</font>

321
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,280
means what you think it means right

322
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,950
you got to put some context behind it

323
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,500
right okay external consultant you say

324
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,820
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a high-risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finding can you</font>

325
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,580
please explain to me what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

326
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,050
impact is oh I'm sorry it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

327
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,360
vulnerability scan output did you

328
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,920
actually validate that because you know

329
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a pen tester that's what we're paying</font>

330
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">you for is the manual validation not the</font>

331
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,060
running of the tool right silly<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

332
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,440
anyway these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the things we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

333
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,709
ask great in terms of contextualizing

334
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,210
because by the way if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> app sec tools</font>

335
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,860
or we've just did some research on a

336
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,720
half-second so this is top of my mind

337
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,190
but ab psych tools are a great example

338
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,900
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a bunch of results and you</font>

339
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,760
throw the reported the developers and

340
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,800
developers go bite me<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

341
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,800
cleaned up a little bit fruit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

342
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,839
kids in the room right but you know you

343
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">take this out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and report that has no</font>

344
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,530
context no meaning for them whatsoever

345
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,800
and then you drop it in their laps like

346
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">a atomic bomb it's like then you run</font>

347
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,780
away giggling key auditors like to do

348
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,280
this too by the way right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came</font>

349
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and checked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out your controls</font>

350
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,030
and I think that you have some

351
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,260
weaknesses in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your control structure you</font>

352
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,189
need to address these here here and here

353
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,689
you know you have NT in your environment

354
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,040
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not networked but it's</font>

355
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,610
still NT so that must be high risk

356
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,410
finding I love to see our security

357
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,960
community as they pass through airports

358
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,699
and they look at non networked devices

359
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,460
and then they mock them for being of

360
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,740
older OS generations you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

361
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,710
is vulnerable to autorun attack yes but

362
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,210
there's no input ports so maybe look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

363
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,620
the context a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

364
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,710
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that I'm going to run out of</font>

365
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,700
time if I keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this pace right</font>

366
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,990
three examples here you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

367
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read them so the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one I put up</font>

368
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,830
here is your risk of 72 what does that

369
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,930
mean nobody knows your risk is high

370
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,450
again what does that mean we can even

371
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these you know a likely loss of</font>

372
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,290
half a million to a million now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a</font>

373
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,750
big fan of quantitative risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis I</font>

374
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,520
love fair but that statement there

375
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,790
doesn't tell me anything how did you

376
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,230
define likely what's the probability did

377
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,120
you actually look at the probability and

378
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,230
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way there is one thing that comes</font>

379
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of this though that is beneficial</font>

380
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,450
and different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the previous two</font>

381
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:31,790
which is using a range if you were to

382
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,649
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me and say and I were to ask you</font>

383
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,759
how tall am I what's your what

384
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:42,930
you're gutting come how tall do you

385
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:46,529
think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am sir you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong guy to</font>

386
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:54,170
ask can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> translate that into inches</font>

387
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:57,569
frillies no no standard units go home

388
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah right so here so here's the thing</font>

389
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:03,748
they're all wrong why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all wrong</font>

390
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,769
because they used a point value so

391
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">unless you're standing with a tape</font>

392
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:08,550
measure can actually measure me your

393
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,389
point value is probably not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

394
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,040
very accurate we want to use ranges<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

395
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:15,959
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that I'm probably</font>

396
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,179
taller than<font color="#CCCCCC"> four feet and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

397
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,699
shorter than<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feet that's like</font>

398
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,189
that's an accurate range that my height

399
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:26,490
falls into now it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very precise and</font>

400
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:28,199
so precision is the secondary attribute

401
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,029
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go from towards when</font>

402
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,410
we'd use these ranges right and then we

403
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">can assign confidence values and things</font>

404
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,920
like that very<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting stuff I know</font>

405
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,429
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all just tell it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the number</font>

406
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,878
people are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo but I would far</font>

407
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:45,300
rather you say you know Ben is four to

408
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:48,509
eight feet tall than to say he's six

409
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,550
foot tall and be wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's put</font>

410
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:53,429
this into business value when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

411
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you present to your sea level and to</font>

412
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:57,689
your board do your board I think there's

413
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,309
a nine percent ninety percent chance of

414
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:01,498
this happening it didn't happen

415
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:04,649
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're wrong and you look bad</font>

416
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:05,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we think you know there's a seventy</font>

417
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,740
to ninety percent chance of this

418
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,970
happening it didn't happen okay it was

419
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,069
still greater than fifty percent but

420
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,100
we're also now<font color="#E5E5E5"> booking that within a</font>

421
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:15,420
time period and maybe say five years

422
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well now you can build some</font>

423
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,899
credibility around that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can pull</font>

424
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,360
in some data<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bolster that and so</font>

425
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,699
using those ranges can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help kind of lend</font>

426
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,129
you credibility so that's very important

427
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,569
to one last<font color="#E5E5E5"> point on process stuff</font>

429
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:33,618
completely bored to death process is

430
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:36,689
cool it's important for repeatability

431
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:38,850
but don't get mired down into it in such

432
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:41,309
detail that you end up killing

433
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:44,699
yourselves in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right if your</font>

434
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:46,860
process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,000 steps long and takes</font>

435
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,969
you months to complete you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

436
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,709
reconsider

437
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,720
the other thing about processes you

438
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,670
process it's great for transparency if

439
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,189
you put it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a language</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

440
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,740
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows for transparency</font>

441
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,389
so if you use tools if you publish it

442
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,430
because if management comes on and says

443
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:04,589
what you're doing you say I'm doing the

444
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,938
risk assessment process and they don't

445
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,198
understand what that means they have no

446
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of how to go about understanding</font>

447
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,589
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means you're probably are</font>

448
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,459
going to have some additional questions

449
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:17,428
to answer there so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> raises the</font>

451
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,689
was told i need to do risk assessment of

452
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,579
what do i do well process first that's

453
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">always a good starting point and then</font>

454
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,289
you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start operationalizing it</font>

455
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,610
this I chart is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our research and it</font>

456
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,370
looks at some of the common frameworks

457
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,809
that are out there today and the two

458
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,760
things we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at here in blue is</font>

459
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:37,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">ramp up time so how much how long it</font>

460
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,520
takes to go from nothing to the

461
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:43,460
completion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the first assessment and</font>

462
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,720
then the will call it yellowish green

463
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,919
spring green there we go very spring

464
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,630
green seemed appropriate to summer here

465
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,100
is cycle time so once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your</font>

466
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,740
process in place how long does it take

467
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do subsequent iterations through that</font>

468
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:00,600
process to complete results anybody

469
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:03,179
notice anything here in particular cobit

470
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">five is a bit of an outlier anybody</font>

471
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,679
looked at cobit five<font color="#E5E5E5"> before code five</font>

472
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,630
for risk yeah it's kind of big isn't it

473
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,580
rather thorough so there's an

474
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting correlation here is that the</font>

475
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,840
ones that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the longest ramp up time</font>

476
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,030
typically also imply that you really

477
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,260
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get somebody who is very</font>

478
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,850
intimately familiar with that framework

479
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,010
in order to customize<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to your</font>

480
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,600
organization because there's so much

481
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,610
behind it and it takes a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

482
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">co but is is hands down the most</font>

483
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,439
thorough and most complete of all the

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,668
frameworks for better<font color="#CCCCCC"> in floors you</font>

485
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,309
probably may not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it at</font>

486
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:37,799
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very bottom fair we have a moderate</font>

487
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,510
ramp up time very short turnaround it's

488
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,260
a bit of an unfair comparison because

489
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:45,150
fair is a risk analysis tool not a risk

490
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,070
assessment process or framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

491
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,960
just want to highlight that there but

492
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,570
the key here is when you start sitting

493
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,620
down to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay make my process we're</font>

494
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,730
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good what am I going to do for</font>

495
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,340
risk assessment what I'm gonna do for

496
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,320
risk analysis you need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

497
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,510
thought in mind how much time can you

498
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,620
afford to take in building that process

499
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,620
and building that overall

500
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,229
approach because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can</font>

501
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">afford to spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 months doing</font>

502
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,220
that okay great<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine I would</font>

503
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,809
argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could probably accomplish</font>

504
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,710
way more in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those six months if you work</font>

505
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:19,770
and focus on something less robust just

506
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:22,559
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some results risks a safe is up</font>

507
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,139
there that one is a SAS based tool based

508
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,760
framework this is literally it's it's a

509
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,170
questionnaire driven one and so there

510
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,340
isn't much ramp up time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there isn't</font>

511
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,780
much cycle time because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go in and</font>

512
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,199
you do initial population of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data</font>

513
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,030
your context information in terms of

514
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,350
appetite and capacity and then you just

515
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,450
run through essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a questionnaire</font>

516
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,189
type thing now the flip<font color="#E5E5E5"> side is it's a</font>

517
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,160
very lightweight qualitative assessment

518
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,750
and your value may vary pretty widely

519
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,440
and there's a lot of assumptions that

520
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:51,480
get covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in a lot of that stuff so</font>

521
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,490
key takeaway here is starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> someplace</font>

522
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,160
picking a framework is a good approach

523
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,679
but you have to understand things that

524
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,270
attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the frameworks and</font>

525
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's such as the ramp up time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at startup</font>

526
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:07,200
time or cycle time there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

527
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:08,460
errors and misconceptions we talked

528
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,460
about estimation and correlate

529
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,500
calibration already so really avoid

530
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,590
those point values heavily leveraged off

531
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,960
of using ranges you can assign<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranges to</font>

533
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,559
qualitative assessment there's nothing

534
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong with that in fact for triage</font>

535
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,120
purposes it's actually very advantageous

536
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,020
to do that but it's also important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

for overestimating a lot of negatives in

558
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,539
the big one of course is reputation

oh we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a breach and then</font>

of target that generally isn't true in

fact many organizations that had

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,590
significant breaches are back to trading

you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not connected with</font>

575
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:57,820
the daily operational things to really

576
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:59,289
get those estimates right bad

577
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,730
assumptions of herbage and garbage out

578
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,649
this is a theme<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will see</font>

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,320
throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of this deck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Giga is</font>

580
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:07,059
a big problem if you make an assumption

581
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,619
and you make an assumption and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

582
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,590
completely different assumptions your

583
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:12,879
analyses are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different and</font>

584
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,988
now if you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to talk to</font>

585
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:16,149
somebody in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back of the room and</font>

586
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:17,409
you're comparing notes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all make</font>

587
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,479
work from different assumptions or

588
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:21,519
undocumented assumptions this can cause

589
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,830
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of problems right this goes back</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that context problem to right context</font>

591
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">setting is really key and assumptions</font>

592
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:32,019
tie into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oops gaming the system</font>

593
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,239
every framework every methodology every

594
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,999
process is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be susceptible to a</font>

595
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:40,989
degree of gaming of the system it's just

596
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:43,840
inherent property the goal is not to

597
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:46,269
remove all subjectivity towards the

598
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,759
mythical objectivity which doesn't exist

599
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:50,799
subjectivity is a spectrum<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's not</font>

600
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">a binary condition and so there will</font>

601
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,600
always be a degree of subjectivity and

602
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,720
that's okay so if you read a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

603
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,820
modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> research from guys like anuman</font>

604
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,220
you'll find that actually you're into is

605
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,320
intuition your intuitive reaction to

606
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:10,450
things tends to be pretty accurate and

607
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:12,428
pretty reliable<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so if we ignore</font>

608
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,100
that to a degree that can be problematic

609
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:18,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if we listen to it too much and go</font>

610
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,178
against facts and data you know we have

611
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch out for that and that's where</font>

612
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,539
gaming the system can come into play

613
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,859
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples where I've seen gaming of</font>

614
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:26,369
the system not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily specific to</font>

615
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:28,689
risk assessment though bug tracking

616
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:30,850
reward programs internally to organize a

617
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,630
hey developers if you find bugs in your

618
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,919
code you'll get a bonus a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

619
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,390
laughed over that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they realize</font>

620
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the developers in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just introduced</font>

621
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,740
bugs into their code and then magically

622
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,770
found the bugs in their code and then

623
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,450
got a bonus or reducing your bug count

624
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,940
numbers to that's another one right so

625
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wow my codes really buggy today oh wait</font>

626
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,560
tomorrow I fixed it all at one hundred

627
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,180
percent resolve rate so I get a bonus

628
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,840
except that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know those numbers are</font>

629
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,090
all skewed so in their use of math magic

630
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,919
so one of the biggest problems with

631
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,419
qualitative approaches is that people

632
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,370
never settle for just doing a

633
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,020
qualitative approach they like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

634
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,239
their labels and then assign them

635
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,730
numerical values and then do all sorts

636
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,290
of weird mathematical computations now

637
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,020
it's one thing to do kind of a matrix

638
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,610
based approach where you know on a scale

639
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">from one to ten this a scale of one to</font>

640
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,179
ten that you add them up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fine get</font>

641
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">some numbers you can put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that into a</font>

642
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,660
matrix type approach that's not a

643
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem heat map it whatever you want to</font>

644
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird stuff is</font>

645
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,410
when you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things like okay</font>

646
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,080
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this for my x value I</font>

647
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,700
use this for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Y value now I'll square</font>

648
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,290
the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then give me the square</font>

649
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,800
root and that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me a placement</font>

650
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,960
out here or even stranger calculations

651
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,450
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about gaming the system</font>

652
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,710
let's introduce some waiting you know I

653
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

654
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,760
vulnerabilities are more important than

655
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,949
we then threats so I'm just going to

656
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,030
wait towards you know vulnerabilities or

657
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,500
I think certain classes of

658
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,110
vulnerabilities are maybe more important

659
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,540
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty common one</font>

660
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,939
to where you do a questionnaire like

661
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,070
well is this internet facing it is 0 x

662
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,870
100 and suddenly like anything that's

663
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,830
internet-facing is immediately a high

664
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,600
risk you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know even if it's just you know</font>

665
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,159
ftp is open or<font color="#E5E5E5"> finger is open or</font>

666
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,439
something really ridiculously right just

667
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,300
a port is open right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to watch</font>

668
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,830
out for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the funky gaming that</font>

669
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,659
happens through the use of math magic as

670
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:27,490
well the biggest takeaway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will I want</font>

671
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you from this one that was again</font>

672
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,650
just start someplace get process in

673
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,410
place and then iterate through and

674
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,600
improve it over time right don't just

675
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">assume that you can get to a solid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

676
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">game right off the bat it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

677
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">take time and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason it's going to</font>

678
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,490
take time is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

679
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,650
have to

680
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,880
socializes with the rusty organization

681
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,170
you're going to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get by and</font>

682
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to continue to get</font>

683
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">by in you're going to have to do a lot</font>

684
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:53,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of education training and awareness</font>

685
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,570
because not everybody thinks about

686
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,570
technical risk in the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do and</font>

687
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,649
so you get that process<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place but</font>

688
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,540
then you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start going out</font>

689
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,270
there and socializing it again i really

690
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend leveraging off of iso 31000 as</font>

691
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,830
a general process framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

692
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,720
very solid oh and by the way most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

693
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,030
large frameworks are converging on iso

694
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,679
31000 as their approach anyway so it

695
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,389
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense to do that and then the</font>

696
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">last one again iterate involve iterate</font>

697
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,290
involved this is kind of a DevOps

698
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,929
concept right get something out there

699
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:26,980
get it working get feedback on it

700
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:29,559
improvement repeat right so again don't

701
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,520
don't try to get the perfect process

702
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,129
because you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> never get the perfect</font>

703
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,410
process get a process in place get

704
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:39,550
stakeholders identified grow that mature

705
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:41,860
that over time so let's talk about

706
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:46,120
triage anybody trained in first

707
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,770
responder<font color="#CCCCCC"> or paramedic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emt take me to</font>

708
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,889
the triage process<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the what's the</font>

709
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:52,660
first thing you check yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

710
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:56,170
well he can add<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else behind you</font>

711
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,970
raise your hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is the scene safe now</font>

712
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:03,460
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> check scene safe next got a</font>

713
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:09,550
victim on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground will you check what</font>

we need to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you or</font>

to a degree right so you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly but the goal here is is</font>

questions and what the objective is here

what's the outcome it should not look

770
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,130
like a super complicated machine right

that's that's that leads to bad juju and

we have you know builds ill-will with

where you see a lot of your agile

methods or your DevOps shops coming into

811

allows you to tune your approach

your triage approach and say oh this is

you're agile or not or agile fall is

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,110
some of the shops have been calling it

835
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,120
lately I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> how fast you think</font>

dealing with highly sensitive data and

838
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:03,130
no you cannot test with real data sorry

839
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,779
you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do data masking data</font>

reduction techniques get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

841
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:08,799
there and we'll assess it accordingly

842
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:10,090
all right but this allows you to kind of

843
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,610
plug into things a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better</font>

along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

845
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,229
interesting too is you can use multiple

00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:18,699

a fairly strictly<font color="#CCCCCC"> asset based</font>

the business how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this system</font>

00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:31,270
cost me to recover that's not too bad

853
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,380
overall but we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,679
especially if you look at just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

856
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:37,059
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs that doesn't</font>

857
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,700
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate to actual business</font>

858
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,080
value business meaning you can take that

859
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,280
up a level and you can say okay well

860
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,500
let's look at this from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

861
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,960
process perspective okay so this is for

862
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,669
billing transactions this is for payroll

863
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,890
transactions this is for you know

864
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:52,750
ecommerce is for b2b whatever process

865
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,549
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define and look at the</font>

866
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,250
relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of that to the business</font>

867
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then track that back to what are the</font>

868
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,850
underlying assets that are involved and

869
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,889
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a correlation the</font>

870
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,379
third basis that you can use is

871
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,820
performance basis and this is can be

872
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,860
this tends<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little more abstract</font>

873
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,379
and a little harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially</font>

874
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,120
document up front but can be really

875
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,010
valuable in the long run so you say okay

876
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,409
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> a business function what's</font>

877
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,879
important to the business what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

878
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,830
know if you go to your CEO or the

879
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,940
president of your company and say what's

880
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,199
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing what are the</font>

881
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,660
business objectives for the year what

882
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,160
are we trying to accomplish and they you

883
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,250
know they tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay we want to grow</font>

884
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,320
x percent for the year ok cool how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

885
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,820
go now<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the business lines and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

886
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,760
how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you contributing to that growth</font>

887
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,799
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can i enable that within the</font>

00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,870
risk management process how can I tie

889
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,549
that into all of the assessments so you

890
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,899
want to do an itz upgrade on a major

891
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:45,340
system that impacts this line of

892

895
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:55,629
two days<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they won't achieve that</font>

896
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:57,549
that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be problematic right so using</font>

897
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,260
that up that performance based approach

898
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:01,360
can be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful same goes for up</font>

899
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,950
time for example so this can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

informal things let's talk about

907
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,450
something also<font color="#CCCCCC"> important which is making</font>

thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about quantitative stuff so</font>

919
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:50,339
let's slay some dragons because there's

920
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:51,600
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said quantitative approach and</font>

921
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,300
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be dragons right</font>

922
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,668
therapy dragons so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Mythology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around quantitative approaches</font>

924
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:00,810
and we hear this from all sorts of

00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,670
notable people including from you know

926

well known people who work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> incidents</font>

927
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,180
like Brookings who write<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ill</font>

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:15,120
quantitative risk analysis there is no

00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:19,590
perfect data in the world ever period

<font color="#CCCCCC">end of story anybody disagree let's go</font>

come on anybody disagree we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

934
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,460
understand hardly anything when you get

935
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,530
right down to it especially when you

936
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at quantum physics right</font>

937
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,490
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of unknowns in the world</font>

938
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,379
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no perfect data we will never</font>

our<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies continue to operate how is</font>

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,380
are made you know how is this done how

946
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,700
our executive surviving and doing so

947
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,860
well if they don't have perfect data

948
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,569
well they do the best they can with the

949
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">data available right that's all you can</font>

950
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,040
hope for so from a quantitative risk

951
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,260
analysis perspective the same rule

952
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,270
applies we will never have perfect data

953
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">however if we use estimation and</font>

954
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,670
calibration techniques use those ranges

955
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:11,910
we can get to a reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of</font>

962
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,180
problem that i think is it very

963
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people will say</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat centric approach and I'm</font>

people still today 2014 don't have an

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the unknown vulnerabilities stop and ask</font>

the very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

975

what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're protecting what's</font>

976
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:58,349
important to the business because<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

977
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,359
what for me even<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a quantitative</font>

978
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,650
risk analysis perspective you can make a

00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of good decisions based off of</font>

primarily next one up there your

00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:18,869
estimate is bad also<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes along with bad</font>

00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,019
point values use ranges do estimation

991
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,879
and calibration you can address some of

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems you think the data is bad</font>

00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:37,049
well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see my industry</font>

996
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,788
listed in there okay fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> well let's go</font>

997
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:40,619
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> data for our for your in for our</font>

998
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,140
industry or let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at our own</font>

999
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,059
records you got firewall logs you have

1000
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,319
server logs and get application logs you

1001
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:47,490
have all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things going on you</font>

1002
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:50,400
could probably be running vulnerability

1003
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,990
scans<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test etc etc etc right lots of</font>

1004
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,519
data sources forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry</font>

1005
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's look at what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what's</font>

1006
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,939
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in your environment what's</font>

1007
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:01,109
important and then last one there you

1008
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:02,849
can't estimate likelihood<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that</font>

1009
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:05,098
argument carries some weight to a degree

1010
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you can say within a reasonable</font>

1011
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,059
degree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think a major</font>

1012
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,390
incident in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next five years is</font>

1013
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:15,329
probably reasonable for any organization

1014
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,799
so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to narrow that down</font>

1015
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">now and get better information around</font>

1016
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,788
and say okay I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want a major</font>

1017
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:23,009
event so what's important what does that

1018
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:25,920
actually mean major event and let's

1019
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,690
track that back to something so again

1020
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,880
this comes as a really big important

1021
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,880
point which is there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of data in</font>

1022
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">your organization go get it go use it</font>

1023
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,509
and start doing some number crunching

1024
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,899
anybody have high school or college age

1025
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:41,400
kids they like numbers they like math

1026
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,250
they like statistics they'd like

1027
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,569
anything like that push them into data

1028
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:50,700
science it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future there is so</font>

1029
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:52,859
much big modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on there already</font>

1030
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,868
for data scientists data scientists are

1031
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:56,730
few and far between really hard to find

1032
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:58,589
good data<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientists today and for all</font>

1033
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,059
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there it's</font>

1034
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:02,099
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to find competent</font>

1035
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:03,900
people like that guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing over there</font>

1036
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,410
who can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the crunching and do</font>

1037
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,530
the

1038
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:09,629
says it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of it all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

1039
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very important to find and build</font>

1040
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,750
these data science skills within your

1041
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,070
organization's and you know for the

1042
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks who have young kids who have</font>

1043
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,540
potentially an aptitude for math and

1044
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,250
obsolete and stuff like that suggests

1045
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,779
that they go that way because you don't

1046
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,660
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a degree in computer science a day</font>

1047
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,100
to go do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security right or anything IT</font>

1048
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,660
related in fact there's a lot of value

1049
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,740
in doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else completely and</font>

1050
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,629
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming and bringing those</font>

1051
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,850
analytical skills in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to</font>

1052
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,950
do statistical modeling and data science

1053
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,480
as a data scientist has a lot of

1054
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,890
potential value going forward for the

1055
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,220
very for the foreseeable future and

1056
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:44,670
beyond last slide under this section

1057
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,189
here beware of common mistakes look

1058
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,880
before you leap there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1059
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:52,020
potential things here so again watch out

1060
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,570
for your assumptions make sure you

1061
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,940
clearly document them enlist the support

1062
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,770
from your subject matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> experts right</font>

1063
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,450
so nobody in this room is probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1064
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be complete subject matter expert for</font>

1065
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,580
every domain under risk analysis you

1066
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,200
probably be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at the technical</font>

1067
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,819
estimation or you probably be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1068
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,189
good at the business impact estimation

1069
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,290
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rare for people to have enough</font>

1070
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,060
grounding in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

1071
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:17,790
get estimations for both of those camps

1072
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:20,340
reliable and within reason right and

1073
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:23,190
again try applying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> rational filter</font>

1074
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,960
to things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff to watch</font>

1075
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,820
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for fragile and unstable conditions</font>

1076
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,040
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the another big one here too so</font>

1077
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,110
you think you have a really well secured

1078
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,240
system you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and say well it</font>

1079
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:35,130
all hinges<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this one control or this</font>

1080
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,350
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack of controls that all do</font>

1081
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,780
prevention no detection or correction

1082
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:42,020
and if this fails if we have a failure

1083
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this controller in this control stack</font>

1084
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,790
we go from really secure to completely

1085
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,050
insecure be a fragile condition the

1086
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,509
other thing to watch out for is unstable

1087
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:54,120
conditions where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you your estimation is</font>

1088
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,790
a really huge range you simply don't

1089
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if you have an incident you may</font>

1090
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,660
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little impact business-wise</font>

1091
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,220
where you may have a lot of impact and

1092
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,230
really it comes down to a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1093
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,240
variables that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just cannot constrain</font>

1094
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,740
very well and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that creates what we</font>

1095
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,750
call an unstable condition within your

1096
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,209
estimation so some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font>

1097
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,580
watch out for again go in eyes wide open

1098
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,110
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get training finding the data</font>

1099
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,240
start digging and start doing the

1100
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,560
modeling yourself put relying on someone

1101
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,089
also tell you what's important to your

1102
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,710
organization start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking what's</font>

1103
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:27,030
actually important to your organization

1104
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:29,820
and then acting on it last major

1105
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:32,190
recommendation here good tools enable

1106
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,050
good practices so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

1107
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,830
process process repeatability is very

1108
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:41,850
important fine only<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes really</font>

1109
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can count</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the onion tools help you</font>

1110
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,839
with that repeatability problem right

1111
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,939
they also help you with gathering<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1112
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,040
and doing analysis on data there are a

1113
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,570
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good free tools available things</font>

1114
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,550
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> are for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example for doing</font>

1115
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:54,930
statistical analysis why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

1116
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,030
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pay thousands of dollars for a</font>

1117
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:00,270
statistical package if you can do it for

1118
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,110
free on a Linux box with all right so

1119
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,310
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

1120
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,650
leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> off of the other thing you can</font>

1121
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:08,250
leverage off of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like GRC now</font>

1122
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:09,750
what I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you is that cultural</font>

1123
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:12,119
fit is very important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually</font>

1124
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">applies to the the IT risk assessment</font>

1125
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,440
frameworks as well so each of the

1126
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:19,110
frameworks tends to have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,109
looking for that cultural fit is very

1136
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:45,299
important for your organization don't go

1137
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:47,069
grab cobit and try to slam it down the

1138
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,590
throat of an educational organization

1139
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,330
it's not going to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> heaven forbid</font>

1140
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,770
of small business right<font color="#CCCCCC"> go at five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1141
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,900
onto a small business you'll crush them

1142
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,970
under the weight of it right on the flip

1143
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,310
side though taking something like risk

1144
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,230
safe and throwing it at your financial

1145
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,279
services organization cap ones in town

1146
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so a little bit of financial</font>

1147
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,359
services in the area probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1148
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,880
best idea a really lightweight check the

1149
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,930
box qualitative assessment probably

1150
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,730
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to make your regular</font>

1151
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,410
regulators very happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you need</font>

1152
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,680
to show a good degree of due diligence

1153
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:18,960
and reflective proactive reasonable

1154
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,569
decision decision making<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes into</font>

1155
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so consider the cultural fit when</font>

1156
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,570
you start building<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and by the way</font>

1157
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that cultural fit also applies to how</font>

1158
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:28,410
you build those processes out to right

1159
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,910
so if everything stays really centric

1160
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:32,160
within your security team or within your

1161
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,420
IT organization and you don't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1162
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,490
involve people from the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1163
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,740
organization you're going to have a hard

1164
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:39,509
time getting them to accept that process

1165
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,459
and buying into that process and so

1166
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:45,000
socialization of techniques come into

1167
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:48,630
play very importantly here to leverage

1168
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,460
platforms wherever possible so what do I

1169
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,500
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a platform well you can go by</font>

1170
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,059
point tools and I'm sure security people

1171
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,730
you probably have purchased point tools

1172
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:58,559
all over the place right we need to get

1173
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">away from that point tool mentality</font>

1174
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this solves this problem this</font>

1175
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,730
very neuro problem we we see this with I

1176
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,380
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifehacker that always talks</font>

1177
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,750
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well right you can go by</font>

1178
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,980
you know a hundred kitchen gadgets and

1179
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,230
fill your kitchen up with all these

1180
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,780
gadgets when<font color="#E5E5E5"> really maybe all you need</font>

1181
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,480
is a knife in a frying pan right maybe a

1182
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,130
spoon so why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy a hundred</font>

1183
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,780
point tools if you can get by with a

1184
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,359
platform that you can extend to meet

1185
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,339
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs and so that's very key GRC</font>

1186
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:28,259
provides an interesting platform into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1187
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:30,089
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for aggregating a lot of</font>

1188
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,650
data doing dashboard reporting doing

1189
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:33,270
normalization if you have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> bowl</font>

1190
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,630
and scanners coming in things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1191
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:39,740
can be very useful again formalized

1192
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:42,270
processes keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple triage</font>

1193
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,109
communicate now that last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font>

1194
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">very important I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1195
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:47,960
mentioned that much at all communication

1196
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">is very very very very very important</font>

1197
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I think that was enough if you get</font>

1198
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,779
the point right communication if you

1199
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,940
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out and speak to people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

1200
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:59,069
don't clearly communicate what the

1201
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,599
expectations are hey why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you here</font>

1202
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:02,220
why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you interrupting my process why</font>

1203
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,990
is this toll gate here then you're going

1204
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,538
to have a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so</font>

1205
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,308
communication is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> key by the way</font>

1206
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:10,529
don't forget about training if you're

1207
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:12,000
going to inject your risk assessment

1208
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:13,710
step into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> procurement process a</font>

1209
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,539
better train people on what that means

1210
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,569
to them why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> important what they</font>

1211
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:19,799
have to do around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it training might mean</font>

1212
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:20,940
classroom training it might mean

1213
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:22,529
hands-on training might mean something

1214
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,059
else altogether so you have to

1215
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:26,609
understand again your audience in your

1216
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:28,200
culture that you have to fit and go in

1217
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:29,970
and fit your training to that and then

1218
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,589
by the way build some<font color="#E5E5E5"> measurements</font>

1219
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,509
around that so you can evaluate the

1220
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:35,730
effectiveness of that training on an

1221
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,230
ongoing basis people aren't adhering to

1222
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,549
the process why is that why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they</font>

1223
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,869
breaking out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process well let's</font>

1224
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:41,549
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's the</font>

1225
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:42,660
breakdown when's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time you did</font>

1226
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:44,160
training<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the feedback on the</font>

1227
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,060
training people understand the training

1228
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,990
do you understand why there

1229
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:51,820
being asked to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something different</font>

1230
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:54,399
very important to do and again lastly

1231
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,890
you are what you eat right garbage in

1232
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,180
garbage out so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just throwing a</font>

1233
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,920
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the wall and hoping</font>

1234
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,419
something sticks that's not a good way

1235
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision not a good way to run</font>

1236
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,080
an organization we want to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1237
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,790
really good data we want to normalize

1238
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,040
things we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parse for false</font>

1239
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,259
positives clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff up before we</font>

1240
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,590
make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ratchet down the</font>

1241
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,880
rhetoric of degree 2 I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just to</font>

1242
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,530
recap there's the five recommendations

1243
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,230
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get the slides to the</font>

1244
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,340
guys here to make them available to

1245
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,690
we're probably almost out of time but we

1246
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,770
can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple questions if anybody</font>

1247
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:27,910
wants to throw them out and I'll be

1248
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:29,890
around for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us the afternoon as well i'll</font>

1249
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,580
post<font color="#E5E5E5"> a recommended reading up there but</font>

1250
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,580
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your time</font>

1251
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:41,670
questions anybody before they<font color="#CCCCCC"> kicked me</font>

1252
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,669
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage</font>
