<font color="#CCCCCC">side dealing with computer security</font>

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,240
issues and computer crime issues that we

40

the attorney general's office is

41
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:05,950
structured is in in Virginia there are

42
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:08,220
very few crimes that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Attorney</font>

43
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">General of Virginia can actually</font>

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,540
investigate and prosecute most of those

45
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,310
crimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prosecution side are left up</font>

46
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,690
to the local Commonwealth's Attorney's

47
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:23,890
your local elected prosecutors however

48
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,870
about 13 14 years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> the General</font>

49
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,209
Assembly and its infinite wisdom said

50
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,010
well now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a special</font>

51
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,020
area where the Attorney General can

52
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,540
investigate and prosecute in that and

53
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,170
one of those areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> among a couple others</font>

54
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,429
are computer crimes so about 14 years

55
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago they created the jurisdiction for us</font>

56
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,630
to travel around<font color="#E5E5E5"> Virginia and</font>

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,970
investigate and prosecute all sorts of

58
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,760
computer crimes and so what my section

59
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,390
the computer crime section in the AG's

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,359
office is comprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our attorneys</font>

61
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:01,600
attorneys / prosecutors and we travel

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,290
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> Virginia and prosecute cases in</font>

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,450
the state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> federal court and the</font>

64
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,320
crimes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have jurisdiction over</font>

65
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,570
are Jake Minj and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them anything</font>

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">under Virginia's Computer Crime Act</font>

67
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,870
which is computer fraud computer

68
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,820
trespass I'll talk a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

69
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these shortly computer trespass</font>

70
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,340
computer invasion and privacy email

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:32,109
crimes like spanning and fishing and

72
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:35,470
that sort of thing identity theft we

73
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,810
prosecute and we also prosecute crimes

74
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,060
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Child Exploitation laws so</font>

75
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,930
child pornography online solicitation

76
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:48,190
and unfortunately we see a lot of those

77
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">crimes come across our desk we work with</font>

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,600
all sorts of law enforcement we work

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,820
with Secret Service FBI we work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

80
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> federal codes for cross designated</font>

81
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,630
as federal prosecutors we work with

82
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,359
State Police we work local law

83
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,519
enforcement and so we're hooked in to

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,650
all sorts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of law enforcement across the</font>

85
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,530
state which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

86
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,840
resource for citizens and businesses who

87
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,160
have been in<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble we work across</font>

88
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,690
lines in our enforcement of the law so

89
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,279
we have jurisdiction<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,430
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> and prosecute those kinds of</font>

91
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,799
things we also have a computer forensic

92
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,740
unit within my section where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font>

93
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">take on digital evidence that seized</font>

94
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,680
from crime scenes and we right now have

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,690
three computer forensic examiners and

96
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,160
you know we bring that back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

97
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,880
forensic lab in the attorney general's

98
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">office where we forensic ly analyze that</font>

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,130
material

100
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,680
for investigations and as a prosecutor

101
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,690
that's you know working a lot of our

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,450
cases if I can have my forensic examiner

103
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">in-house it's very helpful to me because</font>

104
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,849
as you all probably know computer

105
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,309
forensics can be rather complex and

106
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,310
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we exist anyways</font>

107
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,250
because a lot of local law enforcement a

108
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,810
lot of local prosecutors don't

109
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,940
necessarily have the expertise to deal

110
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,980
with computer evidence which is which is

111
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the big hurdle in doing any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

112
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,620
sorts of prosecutions around the state

113
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,240
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

114
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,040
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we got what we're going</font>

115
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,290
to do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do today is I'm</font>

116
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on a couple areas that I</font>

117
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,990
think might impact you guys I'm going to

118
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,210
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the law that's out</font>

119
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,140
there you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

120
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,750
database breach incidents which are now

121
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,719
a very common occurrence and it's

122
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have jurisdiction over</font>

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,520
part of what we do is as many of you

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,820
know they're now database breach

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,710
notification laws in almost every<font color="#CCCCCC"> state</font>

126
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,420
across the country so if you're holding

127
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,390
personal information it gets breached

128
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,950
you have to notify our office and you

129
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,740
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notify the affected</font>

130
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:05,099
consumers in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> circumstances so</font>

131
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,850
I'm going to talk a little bit about

132
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,830
database breach notification what we

133
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,960
look for from an enforcement perspective

134
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,880
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what our view is when we get</font>

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">these notices from from you or your</font>

136
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,630
company's that you've been breached I'm

137
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

138
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:25,350
requirements of this law and I'm also

139
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:28,200
going to pinpoint some other laws that

140
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,610
are related to data breaches and and not

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,719
just data breaches about computer

142
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:37,110
security incidents around Virginia and

143
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,730
show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the remedies they're</font>

144
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,990
available should you or your business

145
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:46,530
ever be hacked or you as a citizen ever

146
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,110
find yourself in trouble I'll show you

147
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:52,859

153
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:10,620
a lot of defendants who let's just say

154
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,729
spend a lot of time at home they don't

155

defendants live in this guy we

<font color="#CCCCCC">making millions and millions of dollars</font>

223
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,430
sending spam now you got to remember

224
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,440
this was this was ten years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so</font>

225
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,670
really in tech world this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ancient</font>

226
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,650
times in and it really was but what this

227
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,640
this was significant because it was the

228
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:46,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">first it was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first prosecution for</font>

spamming in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> united states felony</font>

230
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,250

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,430
people out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousands of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars and</font>

232
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,980
sending out you know pumping AOL tons of

233
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,620
spam through AOL servers as many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

234
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:04,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">might imagine because we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Northern</font>

235
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Virginia and AOL and we used to have MCI</font>

236
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the ISPs that are up there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

237
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,000
actually get a lot of jurisdiction on

238
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,890
the criminal side to prosecute crimes

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,570
because we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff running</font>

240
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,550
through the servers in Northern Virginia

241
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:20,150
and that's how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gain jurisdiction in</font>

242
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,599
this case this guy Jeremy<font color="#E5E5E5"> James was a</font>

glass away<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that's and they would</font>

288
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,959
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> drink out of one glass</font>

289
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,760
get another glass<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout it they</font>

290
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,430
weren't watching their glasses so this

291
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,450
was all laid out when we got in there

292
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,800
this guy made a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

293
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:47,270
actually this is where the guy actually

294
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,479
lived was this house in<font color="#CCCCCC"> raleigh so quite</font>

295
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,550
quite a different scenario than then a

296
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,860
lot of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys this guy was obviously</font>

297
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,740
at that time very sophisticated with

298
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,260
what he was doing and in his house up

299
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,880
there in the corner when we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

300
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Attic he had this he had to t1 lines</font>

301
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,060
coming out of his attic to pump that

302
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,640
spam I mean the attorney general's

303
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,910
office back then add<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 t1 line for</font>

304
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:17,060
hundreds of people this guy was paying

305
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:20,300
some tremendous phone bills was buying

306
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,589
see blocks of IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

307
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,689
them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was the</font>

308
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,839
operation he had coming out of his attic

309
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,360
so pretty interesting stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

310
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,360
interesting in that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know nowadays</font>

311
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,510
when we're prosecuting these crimes it's

312
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,160
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very often where we see</font>

313
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,950
setups like this or methods like this

314
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,750
spammer because technology is

315
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,660
ever-changing and frankly it takes a

316
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,459
long time for the law and and and law

317
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,709
enforcement tries to keep up criminals

318
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:50,510
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> always one step ahead because</font>

319
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:53,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">they don't have to abide by laws they</font>

320
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:57,439
can they can work outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the law and so</font>

321
00:14:53,709 --> 00:15:00,469
we try and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried in Virginia to</font>

322
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,360
pass laws that that keep up with the

323
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,459
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> but inevitably their new</font>

324
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,990
techniques their new types of crimes

325
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,020
with every new technology that's

326
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">invented and and new types of crimes</font>

327
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:15,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are perpetrated by these criminals</font>

328
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,979
so that folks concludes the most

329
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,810
interesting part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my talk this morning</font>

330
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,130
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope everyone doesn't go to sleep</font>

331
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,810
after that but what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

332
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,510
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to focus on database</font>

333
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,029
breaches and and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing on on</font>

334
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">our side on the law enforcement so I'm</font>

335
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,540
going to touch on some identity theft

336
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:37,369
which is closely related to database

337
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,949
breaches and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

338
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,959
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer crimes that</font>

339
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,240
are here in Virginia and some of the

340
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,359
conduct<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's covered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by them and and</font>

341
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,410
what we see so as many of you know I'm

342
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,019
sure you're familiar with

343
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,300
it's every year variety has for the last

344
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:56,050
several years put out a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good data</font>

345
00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:00,439
breach investigation report every year

346
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:02,349
where they you know collect a lot of

347
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">information over the course to analyze</font>

348
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,629
you know where data breaches are

349
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:10,250
occurring what kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> database</font>

350
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:14,449
breaches are occurring and they and they

351
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">draw this from law enforcement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

352
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:18,490
you can see Secret Service Homeland

353
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:22,790
Security all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of law enforcement</font>

354
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,920
investigations contribute to this major

355
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:28,120
computer security companies major

356
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,229
computer security organizations and ISPs

357
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">help to put this information together</font>

358
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:36,259
and frankly it's been a very useful tool

359
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,970
for law enforcement to see lon is

360
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:41,060
certainly law enforcement it's much

361
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,980
bigger than than my office such as FBI

362
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,089
and Secret Service where they can

363
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:50,149
concentrate their efforts in combating

364
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:52,819
data breaches so this was their report

365
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:54,800
that they released this year they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

366
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,949
contributing global organizations and

367
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put this up as a lawsuit of</font>

368
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:02,870
for all of you to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of where the</font>

369
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:07,339
trends are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from regarding</font>

370
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:11,599
database breaches 1367 confirmed data

371
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:14,780
breaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty 3437 security incidents</font>

372
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:20,030
not necessarily data breaches and this

373
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:25,668
was over 95 countries represented and so

374
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:28,789
we can see here on this chart that the

375
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:35,360
most prevalent method for data breaches

376
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:37,970
in 2013 were web app attacks that that

377
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,918
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one that Verizon targeted</font>

378
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:44,600
number two was forms of cyber espionage

379
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,549
you know trying to gain you know whether

380
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's trade secrets or intellectual</font>

381
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:52,010
property that sort of thing and then the

382
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">third as you can see at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top and this</font>

383
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,750
is the I'm looking at the left-hand

384
00:17:54,049 --> 00:18:00,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">column I apologize fun blocking some</font>

385
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,880
folks view the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-biggest were point</font>

386
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,080
of sale

387
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:10,330
intrusions one of the biggest last year

388
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,270
being target was a major data breach

389
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,590
where there was some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sale</font>

390
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:19,220
intrusion and and then it breaks it down

391
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,230
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there these are the top categories</font>

392
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,940
so card skimmers you'll see at nine

393
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,560
percent insider misuse which personally

394
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,050
fray in our office i'm going to show you

395
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:33,169
are some of our stats here in a second

396
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:37,250
but insider misuse seems to be a major

397
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:40,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with database bridges</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it</font>

398
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,490
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a and and maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

399
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,959
more so represented than than here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

400
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,640
global scale that there there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

401
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,310
lost laptops and there are a lot of

402
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,660
crooked folks working inside companies

403
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:58,820
who have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this material and you</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inside who's doing</font>

408
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,540
it you know what are you going to do

409
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,300
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean you can have all the</font>

410
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,180
the security but if someone turns in

your organization and accesses this

412
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,570
personal information sends it out

413
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,000
there's frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know how much</font>

414
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,159
there is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what we see a lot coming across our desk</font>

database breaches that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've received</font>

431
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,610
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are very small</font>

432
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:24,830
companies and the breaches are not very

433
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:28,280
large they they only affect you know one

434
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,740
person one Virginia resident to Virginia

435
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,560
residents something like that not not

436
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,540
the millions or hundreds of thousands

437
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will see in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the news most</font>

438
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,270
prominent<font color="#CCCCCC"> and those are those are</font>

439
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:44,630
serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and that it's all serious</font>

440
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:48,139
but my point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and someone asked me</font>

441
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:50,570
this at a talk I gave a couple weeks ago

442
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,820
on or a panel I was on and database

443
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,439
breaches someone asks you know does it

444
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,659
really matter i mean this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is</font>

445
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,150
happening so much do these notices that

446
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,980
are sent to consumers do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

447
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,940
matter a consumers<font color="#E5E5E5"> really paying</font>

448
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:09,350
attention to them well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

449
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:11,930
they do and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple reasons one I</font>

450
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,570
know firsthand because we get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

451
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:17,270
citizens who receive these notices and

452
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,889
call up<font color="#E5E5E5"> our office freaked out because</font>

453
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,560
they received the database breach knows

454
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:24,470
but secondly a lot of these breaches are

455
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,899
very personal in nature and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

456
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean by that is as I mentioned there are</font>

457
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,540
only one or two people who are affected

458
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,610
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these breaches in it and</font>

459
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,550
it's not the it's not the hundreds of

460
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:40,520
thousands of affected citizens you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

461
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:43,460
getting swept up it's the one person

462
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,960
who's all their financial account

463
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,800
information including their social

464
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">security number was you know on the</font>

465
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:55,310
laptop that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> left in the employees</font>

466
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,990
car that was stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> from their car you</font>

467
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,649
know that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing and if a</font>

468
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:03,290
criminal gets their hands on a laptop

469
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:06,440
and has access to one person's account

470
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:09,590
information that one person is<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font>

471
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,810
greater risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> victim of</font>

472
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:16,070
identity theft or fraud<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the person</font>

473
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:19,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has swept up in 30 million credit</font>

474
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,740
cards or financial account information

475
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,350
that's been swept up and say a target

476
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,970
breach or<font color="#E5E5E5"> LexisNexis bridge or you know</font>

477
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,030
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the major breaches that we've</font>

478
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,810
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the last</font>

479
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:34,020
years so this these database<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaches</font>

480
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:36,480
are very personal to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and</font>

481
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,530
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the notices certainly have</font>

482
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,590
helped but you know in a large scale the

483
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:46,440
smaller breaches have<font color="#E5E5E5"> dominated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

484
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:49,080
landscape that we've seen as I mentioned

485
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,680
we get up we get a broad range of

486
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,169
victims who have become database breach

487
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:58,140
victims and and somewhat one of the

488
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:01,680
messages I want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

489
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,970
group to your group is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

490
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,480
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a business or an organization</font>

491
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:08,970
and you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be breached and and</font>

492
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,240
and frankly each state takes a different

493
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:17,640
approach to this from our perspective

494
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">our goal in the in receiving these</font>

495
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,860
notices and in dealing with database

496
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,260
breaches is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

497
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,060
consumer or the citizen whose

498
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,180
information has been compromised is

499
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:33,720
notified that's that's what we want we

500
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,600
are our goal is not to punish companies

501
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,620
for having database breaches our primary

502
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:44,639
goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in is fast as</font>

503
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:46,770
possible that that the citizen or

504
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,690
resident who's been effective it's

505
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:52,080
notified of the breach so they can take

506
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,750
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps to protect themselves in</font>

507
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,210
their financial information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

508
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,140
talk about here in a second what these

509
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:03,060
requirements are as far as notices go

510
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,280
and when to provide notice and and that

511
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:09,060
sort of thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that that is our</font>

512
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,450
that is our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not automatically</font>

513
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:15,960
take an adversarial posture to database

514
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:20,670
breaches in our office we're there to

515
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,350
work with you and the companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

516
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,780
receive notices from that may be

517
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,240
deficient in some way we call them up

518
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:31,170
and work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to correct it and get</font>

519
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the notice out and and that's that's</font>

520
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:36,990
what our goal is our goal is not to be

521
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:40,139
adversarial and so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever have a</font>

522
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,860
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

523
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,660
should

524
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,790
meta breach or question about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> breach</font>

525
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,179
or an incident you should not hesitate

526
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:49,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us or you know make sure you</font>

527
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,710
talk if you have attorneys who are

528
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,770
working on this work with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> attorney</font>

529
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:58,410
contact our office to make sure that

530
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're complying so a little bit of an</font>

531
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:02,820
overview about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Virginia's database</font>

532
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,130
breach law as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned almost every</font>

533
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,399
state has a database breach law I think

534
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:11,700
they're 47 now they're still apparently

535
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,010
two or three that do not have database

536
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:18,120
breach law but but every every state has

537
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:22,350
one ours was passed in 2008 and it was

538
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,969
passed with a collaboration a working

539
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,250
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> between business and law</font>

540
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:30,120
enforcement and consumer groups and that

541
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:33,929
sort of thing to create a fair law for

542
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:36,090
when you must notify if if you've been

543
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:39,600
breached and and frankly ours is a

544
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:42,059
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard provision there are more</font>

545
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,129
stringent standards across the country

546
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,440
and and they're less stringent ours ours

547
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,660
is fairly average and you know frankly

548
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,590
when we get database breach notices into

549
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,630
our office at this point you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

550
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,090
seven years into this when these notices

551
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,370
that started being required most

552
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:02,309
companies if certainly if it's a larger

553
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:06,270
scale company most companies they follow

554
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:08,790
the most stringent standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

555
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:12,389
notices and so naturally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to</font>

556
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,490
comply with Virginia's standard if

557
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,070
they're following the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most strict but</font>

558
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:20,370
you know when does a database breach

559
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,710
notice apply well that the statute

560
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,600
basically says it applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any legal</font>

561
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,960
entity it's it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very broad</font>

562
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,590
application it's so basically if you're

563
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,830
an organization accompany a<font color="#E5E5E5"> county the I</font>

564
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,830
even government has to do this and we've

565
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,330
had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive government breaches</font>

566
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:42,770
even in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Virginia the Department</font>

567
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,030
of Health was breached several years ago

568
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:48,120
thousands and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousands of their records</font>

569
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,678
and they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send notice but if you</font>

570
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,489
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a legal entity and you're holding</font>

571
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,630
this information and you've experienced

572
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,340
sub-regional

573
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,930
tell you what a breach is here in a

574
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,709
second then you need to provide notice

575
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:05,100
the data we're talking about if it's

unencrypted data<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is accessed or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">acquired acquired but it by an</font>

578
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,930
unauthorized person that's going to

579
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,960
trigger your notice and it must have

580
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:19,220
caused or reasonably<font color="#CCCCCC"> believed will cause</font>

581
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,440
fraud or identity theft to a resident

582
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,290
and then if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case you must</font>

583
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">notify our office the attorney general's</font>

office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the affected residents</font>

585
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:35,010
without unreasonable delay now what is

586
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:37,500
reasonably believed to have caused fraud

587
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:41,760
or identity or may cause fraud or

588
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:47,070
identity theft there is no definition of

589
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:51,270
reasonably believed so in the ultimate

590
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:53,429
sense that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is why really</font>

591
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:56,190
you should talk to our office and also

592
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:58,890
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your attorneys in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimate</font>

sense reasonably<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe is going to be</font>

594
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:05,130
decided if this ever was litigated it's

595
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,919
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by a judge in in the</font>

596
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:11,430
prosecutor as to what it's reasonably

597
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:14,760
you know reasonable as far as head may

598
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:16,860
cause identity theft or fraud it is very

599
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,500
difficult to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and give a</font>

600
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,600
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> different hypothetical fact</font>

601
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,830
situations you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use your common</font>

602
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,919
sense so for example if a laptop is

603
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,830
stolen there is no encryption on

604
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,870
personal information on that I've saw or

605
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,899
if someone hacks into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database and</font>

606
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,879
pulls the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it's</font>

607
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,920
reasonable to think that that

608
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,140
information is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be misused in</font>

609
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,920
some way to commit to commit identity

610
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,920
theft there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of scenarios where</font>

611
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:53,010
it may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonable to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

612
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:55,620
but my point it my point is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

613
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:58,920
assess the fact situation of the breach

614
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:02,010
talk with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> office and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with your</font>

615
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,750
attorney to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

616
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,520
complying with the statute and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

617
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,320
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements triggered now you</font>

618
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,190
have to notify us without unreasonable

619
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,809
delay

620
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:15,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also not define some states have</font>

621
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:18,539
Attorney General's offices attorneys

622
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,779
general offices have have created

623
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:24,360
bright-line rules as to when you have to

624
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:28,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">send out the the notice so for example I</font>

625
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:31,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">think Indiana says you have 30 days okay</font>

626
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,990
you have 30<font color="#CCCCCC"> days after you discover the</font>

627
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,659
breach to send out the notice all right

628
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:39,210
our office doesn't have such a bright

629
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:42,029
line rule what we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for is</font>

630
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,179
when you discover the breach you need to

631
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:47,789
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a good-faith effort to assess</font>

632
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:51,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the situation immediately and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it began</font>

633
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process of notifying the consumers</font>

634
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,658
now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all sorts of ways to</font>

635
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,539
notify I'm going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some more</font>

636
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,120
requirements but the short of it is if

637
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:02,190
find out about the breach you can't sit

638
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,080
on the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

639
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,389
start going and different breaches are

640
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,330
different scales some take more time to

641
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:12,029
assess than others so setting a

642
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:15,210
bright-line rule I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

643
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:19,500
effective necessarily that is there are

644
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:22,379
exceptions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the statute for delay one</font>

645
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,139
of them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest in most</font>

646
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">prominent is law enforcement way so</font>

647
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:31,769
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breach</font>

648
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:33,269
itself investigating what happened and I

649
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend if there has been a breach</font>

650
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:40,259
incident you need to contact law

651
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:42,059
enforcement as soon as you can and a lot

652
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:43,799
of times the law enforcement agency

653
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,658
investigate and that includes our office

654
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,940
if you're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Virginia Company you can</font>

655
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:51,230
contact our office on the breach itself

656
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,789
the actual computer security incident

657
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:57,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times law enforcement</font>

658
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:58,710
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not want the company notifying the</font>

659
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,479
consumers and putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

660
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,299
information as to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened so that</font>

661
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can conduct their investigation in</font>

662
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:07,139
an effective manner and so law

663
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,759
enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> delay is acceptable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

664
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:10,320
can show that you've contacted law

665
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,710
enforcement and working with law

666
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,100
enforcement also their notice is

667
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:19,639
required for encrypted data if you

668
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,990
believe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person has access to the key</font>

669
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:24,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if it's just</font>

670
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">up the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just in its</font>

671
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,469
encrypted and that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you don't</font>

672
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get into it then the</font>

673
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,910
notice requirement doesn't apply but if

674
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:36,750
it is encrypted and you also think they

675
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:40,410
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know decrypt it</font>

676
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:43,679
then you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide notice if</font>

677
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:46,260
they're more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

679
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,640
also not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to notify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our office</font>

680

consumer reporting agencies of the

burden

722
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:41,279
if a million Virginians information was

723
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:44,399
stolen and you had to send out letters

information accessed so specifically

728

what was in the data set that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was taken</font>

729
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,759
the general acts what you're going to do

730
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:01,919
basically to prevent further

731
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,799
unauthorized access to prevent this from

732
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,339
happening again it must provide a

733
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:11,279
telephone number<font color="#CCCCCC"> for affected persons to</font>

734
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:13,288
call and also advise directing people to

735
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:17,579
remain<font color="#E5E5E5"> vigilant of their accounts and</font>

736
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:19,829
monitor free credit reports most most of

737
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:22,319
the companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get they actually</font>

738
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:25,799
provide free credit monitoring for the

739
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:27,418
person affected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not required</font>

740
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:30,509
in Virginia<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some states it is</font>

741
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">required and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are more national</font>

742
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:35,519
companies that actually provide credit

743
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,159
monitoring which i think is good for

744
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:40,768
affected citizens for like a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

745
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,649
that sort of thing so that's generally

746
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:48,328
what is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our database</font>

747
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:51,629
breach notification laws and if you fail

<font color="#E5E5E5">to comply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with these laws our office can</font>

751
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:04,259
breach incident I i will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that since</font>

752
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:08,430
this law has come about we have not

753
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:12,059
filed any suits because<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever we've</font>

been we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate wherever there</font>

755
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:16,349
was a deficiency with a company failing

756
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,200
to provide adequate notice they've

757
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:23,279
corrected it immediately but also

758
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,410
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only does it allow for</font>

759
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:28,049
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> office to bring suit the individual</font>

760
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:32,038
can bring suit so the affected citizen

761
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:35,430
or person whose data was compromised can

762
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:39,240
also bring suit against the company for

763
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:42,299
you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it whatever reason if</font>

764
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:47,879
they were not provide provided adequate

765
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:49,290
notice so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again we we are</font>

766
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,340
looking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

767
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:56,060
you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I can generally say that</font>

768
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:58,740
red flags are going to be raised if a

769
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,150
company finds out about a data breach

770
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,189
doesn't report it to law enforcement

771
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,680
there's no law enforcement exception

772
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,990
sits on the data for six months is

773
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,910
scared to to say something because it's

774
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look bad to them it's going to</font>

775
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">look you know create bad press or</font>

776
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it sits on it for months you</font>

777
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:19,590
know six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> or more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or a year or</font>

778
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,540
more and then you know something happens

779
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,880
where this note this breach was found

780
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,920
out or they decide to notify at a later

781
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,740
time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raise a red</font>

782
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,960
flag waiting months and months and and

783
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,700
for no<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reason as I mentioned there</font>

784
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,070
needs to be a good faith effort to

785
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:39,060
address the problem in remedy the

786
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:41,250
situation so related to data breaches of

787
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,799
course is identity theft and that's

788
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,380
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the big reasons why these</font>

789
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,590
database breaches laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists is because</font>

790
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:56,220
of the resulting identity theft that has

791
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:59,240
occurred for example one day I opened up

792
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,459
my credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card statement and found a</font>

793
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:06,299
charge of<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty five hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars of</font>

794
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:15,800
coach purses on my credit card statement

795
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:17,580
so I called my wife and<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like honey</font>

796
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,220
why are there twenty five hundred

797
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,470
dollars or the coach purses and she of

798
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:26,580
course was like I didn't buy coach

799
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:28,980
purses and thus are we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

800
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,730
this was several years ago or credit

801
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,040
card was compromised in some one in

802
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cleveland</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ohio had bought twenty five</font>

803
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,200
hundred dollars worth of coach purses so

804
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:43,470
it happens to everyone and frankly it's

805
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,960
pretty hard to avoid being<font color="#CCCCCC"> at risk to</font>

806
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,319
identity theft and each<font color="#CCCCCC"> year the federal</font>

807
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade commission but they developed a</font>

808
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,900
program where they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with this</font>

809
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,420
consumer Sentinel network they kind of

810
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,370
develop this network to be a data

811
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,340
clearinghouse for identity theft

812
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,680
information and put out some stats

813
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,750
related to identity theft trends each

814
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,980

where where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trends of identity theft</font>

819
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:20,400
are but you can see on this chart that

820
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,030
since 2001 around the time they started

821
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,280
keeping these numbers the number of

822
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">complaints of identity theft and fraud</font>

823
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,330
this includes both fraud and identity

00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:35,970
theft in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> report as as you can see</font>

825
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:39,480
dramatically increased last year they

826
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:42,540
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million one hundred 1780 reports</font>

827
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,750
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's naturally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a deficiency in</font>

828
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:50,880
this reporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all</font>

829
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:55,530
based on actual reported complaints of

830
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,380
identity theft they estimate I think DOJ

831
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,690
estimates that some somewhere like sixty

832
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,060
percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who have been victims</font>

833
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:08,700
of fraud or identity theft don't report

834
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:10,440
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a huge number and you</font>

835
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,750
could probably see why<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the case</font>

836
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:17,010
maybe they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to bother maybe</font>

837
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:21,180
the losses you know twenty dollars

838
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:24,240
twenty-five dollars also a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of credit</font>

839
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,220
card companies now take most of them

840
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,620
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you report that there's a</font>

841
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:32,250
fraudulent purchase they take it they

842
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:36,900
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> the charge from from your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't report this but this</font>

845
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,960
is based on reports and there's part

846
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,960
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a decent cross section on</font>

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,820
a smaller scale of the bigger picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

848
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,090
identity theft and fraud and you see in

<font color="#E5E5E5">Virginia these arrows here Virginia</font>

the country in an identity theft they

853

were 16 so easily in the top half and in

873
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:10,259

874
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,560
you know sending notices through the

saying hey you owe us money send us

877
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,590
money that sort of thing and then it

goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down from their credit cards</font>

identity theft and fraud the difference

00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:45,150
this and so on the identity theft side

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,100
in Virginia the number one area<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

898
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:13,260
credit card fraud like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mentioned</font>

899
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,210

00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:18,240
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down from there bank fraud loan</font>

901
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:22,310
fraud so this kind of highlights the the

902
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:26,040
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> areas in on the Virginia side</font>

903
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:27,750
over the last year where these types of

904
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,859
crime have occurred now in Virginia

905
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,869
there are identity theft

906

907
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:35,970
unlawful to obtain record or access

908
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,980

just accessing this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

915
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,480
for example the data breach that the guy

theft whether he goes and uses it or not

920
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:08,880

we were the first state in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country</font>

962
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,570
to develop this now almost every state

00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,000
as one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these so what happened several</font>

years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucked there are two</font>

00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:09,300
their information was was stolen and

967
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,560
used by another criminal or a criminal

to you know create to commit financial

969
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:20,370

00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:24,060
victim a victim<font color="#CCCCCC"> a's named victim a was</font>

978
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,279
this identity theft passport whereas if

1131
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:32,850

remedy that any individual wronged by

00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:50,640
mentioned malicious intent that standard

00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,490
doesn't apply on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the civil side so</font>

1139

intent it's not required and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>
