1
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,270
so thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for joining us today I'm going</font>

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,939
to tempt fate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and due to technical demos</font>

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,210
for you today the first one is we're

4
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:28,880
going to pack crack a passcode on an iOS

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,250
device using open-source software and

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,930
then the second is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">releasing a tool after the conference</font>

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,610
for automating the forensic stuff that

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,050
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys about today so</font>

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,030
you'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to automate acquisition</font>

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,489
of all the tasty stuff that we're going

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so let's go ahead and</font>

13
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,089
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started I like to get the pin</font>

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:51,019
cracking demo going first because the

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,879
pin on this is 937 one I've cracked it

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,840
many times and it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about twenty</font>

17
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,890
eight minutes so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead</font>

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy rolling and we'll come</font>

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,390
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it later so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me just go ahead</font>

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and fire it up real quick</font>

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:35,030
yes I could have turned that off before

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:37,068
we get stored so does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,600
iphone data protection toolkit or any of

24
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:41,659
the solutions out there for crack and

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,280
pass codes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right so essentially</font>

26
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,670
what we're going to do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,590
jailbreakable device sits in an iphone 4

28
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,689
the trick to using this tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> kit is it</font>

29
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,319
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full feature set only works</font>

30
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:58,189
on iOS 5 5 11 is what I've got running

31
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,509
on here iOS 6 iOS 7 this stuff doesn't

32
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,279
really work there's some limited

33
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,590
functionality on iOS 6 so you can't

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,420
correct pass codes but once you load the

35
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,640
toolkit on the actual device you can use

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,229
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack the keychain and a few other</font>

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,049
things if you have some intimate

38
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:22,160
knowledge of the device so we're going

39
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kick off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> redsnow it all I'm doing</font>

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,840
here is just loading a custom<font color="#CCCCCC"> ramdisk</font>

41
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:34,900
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain this in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minute I have</font>

42
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">a supplementary slide deck to go with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,760
you

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,640
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit</font>

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than the ones that I've done</font>

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the past normally I like to do the</font>

47
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,830
crack from my actual host machine

48
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,990
because it's got some sexy or output so

49
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,600
you can actually see where you are in

50
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,970
the realm of things what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the status is I</font>

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,010
just loaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new Python environment</font>

52
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this week which completely screwed up my</font>

53
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,630
stuff so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to crack it</font>

54
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,950
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual device so I don't know</font>

55
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,480
what it's going to look like after we

56
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,780
crack because I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the</font>

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,130
device itself but I do have a screenshot

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,020
of what it looks like when you do it

59
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:34,480
that way so what I'm going to do next is

60
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:36,590
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to forward my ports and</font>

61
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,600
then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to open up an ssh</font>

62
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:44,120
connection here default password is

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,739
alpine when you root a device and see

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,630
any point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and changing that for a test</font>

65
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,160
device that nobody has access to so

66
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,730
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go the crack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in progress</font>

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,810
now so it's going to iterate through

68
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,970
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically try every</font>

69
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,230
combination and eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will crack</font>

70
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> passcode</font>

71
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,619
alright so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what we're</font>

72
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,810
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so step one we're going to create</font>

73
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,940
our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> ramdisk and there's this is very</font>

74
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,769
well documented they have a wiki the

75
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,570
iphone data protection toolkit wiki so

76
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:21,320
you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you can still get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

77
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,909
iphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 with iOS 5 off of ebay probably</font>

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,469
craigslist as well so if you guys want

79
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,110
to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these to your lab for this</font>

80
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,720
kind of fun and you still can step to

81
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,729
establish a connection to the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH</font>

82
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,470
over USB<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have the device tethered</font>

83
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,930
up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> late as you probably noticed and</font>

84
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,150
then step<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 brute force the passcode</font>

85
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,380
this is typically done on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac but</font>

86
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">again we're actually going to crack it</font>

87
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,139
on the device itself since my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font>

88
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,369
environment is completely buggered up

89
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,830
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks like when</font>

90
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,020
you crack it on the mac so you can see

91
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,570
the iterations here will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font>

92
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,120
an ETA which isn't very accurate but it

93
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,820
does give you the total amount of time

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to crack and then you can see 937 one we</font>

95
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,110
successfully crack that and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,580
down here we've got the keychain

97
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,430
database so we can use keychain

98
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,190
underscore tool py to obtain the secrets

99
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,330
and now we own this device and all of

100
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:16,450
the data on it the crypto is broken so

101
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">passcode link the moral of the story is</font>

102
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,200
four digits simple pass codes are

103
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,620
ridiculously insecure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might as well</font>

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,930
not have one at all right I mean I've

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,660
known security people that have 1 1 1 1

106
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,729
1 2 3 4 as their pass codes because I've

107
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,539
picked up their phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put it in then</font>

108
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:38,180
I had access so 18 minutes is a pretty

109
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,590
good time to crack for it goes up to 19

110
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,289
days you can see it exponentially

111
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,669
increases and these are you know with

112
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,800
the complexity of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin so obviously</font>

113
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,120
alphanumeric and alphanumeric complex

114
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,500
that's really where you want to be if

115
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,940
you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

116
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,270
the software based encryption that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

117
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,099
on these devices so the iphone data

118
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,389
protection toolkits some info here and

119
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:01,729
by the way both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these decks are</font>

120
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,820
available of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conference guys have it</font>

121
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,200
so it'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so there's</font>

122
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,060
the skinny on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going to</font>

123
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,860
really go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through it there's a number of</font>

124
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,979
zidor skis tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually got</font>

125
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,289
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this stuff around 2000</font>

126
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:17,119
late 2009 early 2010 after I

127
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:20,659
had some of Jonathan's papers in his

128
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:23,599
book on iphone forensics and the reason

129
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:25,998
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I created I'll get to that in a</font>

130
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,409
minute so there is a commercial tool kit

131
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:30,529
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500 bucks</font>

132
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:32,058
for a single user license and it

133
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,149
actually works pretty good it can crack

134
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:37,759
simple pass codes and it's a pretty cool

135
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,399
tool kit we use this for actual

136
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,659
assessments where we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

137
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,669
where we're doing risk assessments again

138
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:47,808
it's devices that are greater than iOS 5

139
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:49,430
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtually everybody and then</font>

140
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:51,709
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> study I snagged</font>

141
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,779
off the internet there was 10,000

00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,080
through 9 blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah so basically</font>

144
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:03,249
these were the top twenty four digit

145
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,159
pass codes that were used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the study</font>

146
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:08,330
pretty interesting stuff now while

147
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,069
that's cracking we're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

148
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,869
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start looking at offensive mobile</font>

149
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:15,020
forensics the reason I created this

150
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:16,699
methodology about four<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

151
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,378
because at the time I was getting into

152
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,110
mobile application security assessments

153
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,550
and I noticed when I started reading the

154
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,569
papers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the books and the other</font>

155
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,860
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were coming out there were</font>

156
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,689
not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile</font>

157
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,279
application assessments for years ago

158
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:30,709
virtually everybody and their brother is

159
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing it now but four years ago they</font>

160
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,769
weren't and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at all the</font>

161
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,909

00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,860
perform an application security

163
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:38,899
assessment they all told you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

165
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:43,789
because you can't examine personal data

166
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:46,069
leakage on a simulator and the

167
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:48,740
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile application</font>

168
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,019
security and web application security is

169
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,519
generally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you potentially have</font>

170
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,199
physical access to the device that

00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're attempting to compromise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

172

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not something that web</font>

173
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:59,689
application developers have to deal with

so the wasp top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 was no longer</font>

management flaws are very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

180
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:20,209
etc so a real quick introduction for me

181
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,558
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing the mobile stuff for</font>

182
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,259
about four years now I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing app</font>

185
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,310
is the reason I created

186
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,750
number one because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

187
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,708
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understood it's important</font>

188
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,479
when you perform a mobile application

189
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,429
security assessment that you must look

190
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,690
at data leakage on the device and we're

191
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,419
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at why we're going to see</font>

192
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">lots of examples we saw a great talk</font>

193
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,088
from Abdullah in Jack yesterday where

194
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,430
they were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outing a bunch of</font>

195
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,779
dating apps that were not treating your

196
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,500
private and sensitive information

197
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:54,200
accordingly and there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps</font>

198
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,420
the devices themselves don't do a

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,620
terrific job of protecting your privacy

200
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,029
either and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at that</font>

201
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,670
too so I've got some findings from

202
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:04,100
mobile apps and findings from native

203
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:08,209
apps on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices themselves and I</font>

204
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,850
will cover both iOS and Android so again

205
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:12,829
I usually can talk for 75 90 minutes on

206
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,690
this i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk really fast and</font>

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to skip a bunch so if you'd</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">like to pick my brain afterward then I</font>

209
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,890
welcome that so Google stats you know

210
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,870
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of pointless now but</font>

211
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,569
originally I'd put this stuff in here to

212
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,700
illustrate that smartphones are not a

213
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,620
trend this is basically where we're

214
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,930
headed now and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all know that so I'm</font>

215
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to insult your intelligence</font>

216
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:40,880
more stats tools anybody do forensics in

217
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,339
here cool so these will look familiar to

218
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,290
you then we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some in case we've</font>

219
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,390
got some cellebrite we have the tableau

220
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,550
write blocker up here that's all chain

221
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,060
of custody stuff I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had many</font>

222
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,010
opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote</font>

223
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,329
legitimate forensics and it's not

224
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,300
interesting to me because chain of

225
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,189
custody is a pain in the ass so if you

226
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,959
came here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools and</font>

227
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,790
how you use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> against mobile devices</font>

228
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,649
you're in the wrong place because we're

229
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to talk about what we are</font>

230
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about our hacker tools and</font>

231
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,680
techniques for performing forensics

232
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,329
against mobile devices generally the

233
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,120
number one threat to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices and</font>

234
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:20,120
to BYOD is loss or theft of the device

235
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,950
so physical access so we've got a lot of

236
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,520
number a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different tools here</font>

237
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,380
obviously jailbreaking tools for iOS you

238
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,089
know after doing hundreds and hundreds

239
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,370
of assessments both of my own and

240
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,720
professionally for clients I really got

241
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,510
tired of the command line stuff I'm a

242
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,209
Linux guy at heart Mac now and i love

243
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,250
the command line but SQL lights you know

244
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:41,869
queries and stuff like that hundreds and

245
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,950
hundreds of times it gets old so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

246
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,250
looked for a smarter

247
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,970
a and i like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use our browser for</font>

248
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,260
acquisition now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've written a tool to</font>

249
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,240
perform the acquisition so I don't

250
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,189
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GUI anymore the</font>

251
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,110
trick is get the stuff off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

252
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,820
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host machine because you</font>

253
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,740
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform analysis much quicker and</font>

254
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,390
you have access to much better tools on

255
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,810
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> host machine than you do on the</font>

256
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:11,240
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> device so our browser is a nice</font>

257
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:14,479
SFTP GUI I like razor SQL and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bass for</font>

258
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,340
sqlite client I like these for a couple

259
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons I've pretty much</font>

260
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,690
gone to just using base now<font color="#CCCCCC"> base didn't</font>

261
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,839
used to have support<font color="#CCCCCC"> for blobs and since</font>

262
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,310
iOS 6 apple has been storing virtually

263
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,470
everything and now the apps they're

264
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,689
written for iOS 6 and above store a lot

265
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,330
of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff as blobs not</font>

266
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily as something a clear text</font>

267
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,010
string that's easy to get to you can

268
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,630
still read the blobs but these clients

269
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,189
did a terrible job with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

270
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,070
wouldn't necessarily be able to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

271
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:45,320
so base actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> has great support for</font>

272
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,670
blobs now and there's various other

273
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,720
tools here this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

274

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,260
dollar tool you can go download that and

277
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,140
plug in your phone and you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

analysis of an application before you

it to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that they're going to</font>

287
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,689
treat your data appropriately so these

288
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some screenshots of some of the</font>

289
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,860
tools that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use on iOS redsnow</font>

290
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,290
obviously we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do jailbreaking</font>

291
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,820
tinyumbrella is useless<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we used to</font>

292
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,000
use that to save our blob so that we

293
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,180
could actually regress or downgrade to

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,740
an older version and you would have to

295
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,239
do this because what happens is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple</font>

296
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">stopped signing the firmware and then</font>

297
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,140
you can no longer load it on your device

298
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,840
this is now completely broken and you

299
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,910
can't downgrade anymore at all with

300
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,370
there are some caveats and exceptions to

301
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:47,300
that but as a general rule you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

302
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:49,130
download downgrade anymore so i hate's

303
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,900
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to retire this</font>

304
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,130
thing a lot earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

305
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,520
well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done with jailbreaking</font>

306
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,610
because 71 never got jailbroken now it's

307
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,130
been jailbroken but they have

308
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,500
release the exploit and if you didn't

309
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,640
see the news yesterday iOS 8 beta is

310
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:09,120
jailbroken untethered<font color="#CCCCCC"> stefan jailbroken</font>

311
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,760
so I'm really excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that 10 cm</font>

312
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate snow actually found a bootrom</font>

313
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,230
exploit so those guys claim that they

314
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,120
can now jailbreak any device for life

315
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,190
but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> refuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share it with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

316
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,010
including the jailbreak community at

317
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,779
large now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocm actually got a job</font>

318
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,470
with apple so he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much done with</font>

319
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:30,120
jailbreaking anyway iphone explore this

320
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,620
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh this was when i was looking for</font>

321
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,790
tools where I could actually perform an

322
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,570
assessment without having to get into

323
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the nitty-gritty it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buggy</font>

324
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,980
it's a piece of shit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

325
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,050
recommend it phone view however is a

326
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,700
great application and it was twenty

327
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">bucks i think it's gone up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like 29 or</font>

328
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,230
30 dollars now and as you can see it's

329
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,240
useful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of other reasons if you</font>

330
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,620
want to archive your messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> and call</font>

331
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,529
logs and various other things off your

<font color="#CCCCCC">video guy do move a lot so i'm glad you</font>

334
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,019
got your snack done this is our browser

335
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,029
right here so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually the host</font>

336
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,160
or this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the target machine that i'm</font>

337
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:11,730
pulling stuff over to here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

338
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,560
machine and this is this is a you know a

339
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,269
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool way to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done this</font>

340
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">for years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I decided you know</font>

341
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,930
it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really cool to automate this so</font>

342
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,399
I've got a tool now for that and I'm

343
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,079
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be writing one for Android as</font>

344
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,019
well but I decided to start with iOS

345
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,640
because it's my favorite playground

346
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,649
tools on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android pretty much the same</font>

347
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,350
stuff we're doing a lot of the same

348
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:33,500
techniques it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same tools</font>

349
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,850
with a few differences obviously so

350
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,440
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what platform you're</font>

351
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,620
working with i used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use samsung</font>

352
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,149
devices exclusively for<font color="#E5E5E5"> android I've got</font>

353
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,160
some knocks research at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

354
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">I now hate Samsung because of notch</font>

355
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">knocks they've made it very difficult</font>

356
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,640
for us to modify our devices

357
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,630
particularly if we have to go to work

358
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then hook it up to presumably a Knox</font>

359
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,630
EMM solution enterprise mobility

360
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,550
management solution because it will

361
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,939
essentially what happens is if you load

362
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,620
anything other than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed firmware</font>

363
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,329
custom rom or something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

364
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,100
you don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if you root it</font>

365
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,410
there's an e fuse in there and when you

366
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,660
trip the EF use that device is dead

367
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,399
as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Knox is concerned so you can</font>

368
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the device for personal use</font>

369
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,699
but in the event that your employer

370
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:20,128
decided to roll knocks out in your

371
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,540
environment you're screwed because your

372
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,540
device can't participate in that

373
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,379
ecosystem so I'm done with Samsung I'm

374
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,839
using HTC now I have the the m8 really

375
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,699
sexy device<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cool stuff so tools on</font>

376
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,740
Android one of the biggest difference

377
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:37,170
about Android is that they make a ton of

378
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,079
diagnostic tools available to us that

379
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:43,229
can absolutely destroy a developer's day

380
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,209
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most Android developers</font>

381
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,490
don't bother to suppress any kind of

382
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:50,040
output and so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see lots of</font>

383
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,290
interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a nifty one</font>

384
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,149
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> dump sis you can pass different</font>

385
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,769
parameters to dump sis and look for

386
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:57,899
various interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are on</font>

387
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,550
the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> I happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass account to</font>

388
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,470
it and I'm looking at the accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

389
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,449
were on device you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at one</font>

390
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,970
time I was hooked up to exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> /</font>

391
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:07,829
active sync and you're going to see when

392
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,889
we look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the forensics stuff</font>

393
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:12,989
that this is only the tip of the iceberg

394
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:16,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">as far as data leakage on Android is</font>

395
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,540
concerned android<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still not ready for</font>

396
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,889
the enterprise as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm concerned</font>

397
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">still way too much data leakage on there</font>

398
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:24,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's not enough there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no MDM</font>

406
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,370
can see there's a ton of cool tools out

407
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,110
there that you can get from XDA that

408
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,250
make routing and managing the roms and

409
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,220
the other things on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> android device</font>

410
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,350
is very very easy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loving</font>

412
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,910
can use adb to gain remote access to our

device we don't have to ssh in like we

414
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,670
do on an iOS device but I've had that

415
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:05,428
come back and bite me a few times where

416
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,408
maybe my cable got corrupt or I had some

417

a really cool tool

426
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,839
the probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that I like most</font>

427
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,220
about it is this right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> screenshot</font>

428
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,850
anybody ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to take a screenshot on</font>

429
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android kind of a pain you've got to use</font>

430
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,469
a couple of different tools in the

431
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">platform tools SDK and it's a real pain</font>

432
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,250
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the butt this simplifies it you</font>

433
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,750
literally just hit the screenshot your

434
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">refresh and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can take as many</font>

435
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,650
screenshots as you like there's also a

436
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,910
tool that just came out I haven't

437
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually played with it yet it's called</font>

438
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:54,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">barbecue you can actually it's kind of</font>

439
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,918
like it's kind of like airplay for iOS

440
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,799
devices where you can beam your screen

441
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,240
to an HDTV presentation device stuff

442
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,580
like that so you can check that out as

443
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,440
well other tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use on android</font>

444
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,399
root checker obviously we need to verify

445
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,500
that we have root this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my HTTP proxy</font>

446
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,620
in the event<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i need a local proxy</font>

447
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,510
usually I use burp like what a doula and

448
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jack we're talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday</font>

449
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,530
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of custom</font>

450
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:23,370
recovery I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team win recovery</font>

451
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:25,080
project now twr p<font color="#CCCCCC"> i used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

452
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,280
clockwork but not anymore and then

453
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,840
you're obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need a file</font>

454
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,350
system tool as well so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move some</font>

455
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,240
stuff around so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some data</font>

456
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,730
I've already done the hard part for you

457
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,309
guys I've since iOS four I've cataloged

458
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,770
all of the physical locations for the

459
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:42,418
interesting data that's on these devices

460
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,400
there's tons and tons of data on here

461
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,760
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting in the</font>

462
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,140
realm of attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to steal an identity</font>

463
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,419
or you know attack a person of interest

464
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I've gone through and actually</font>

465
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,940
tracked all this stuff for you in the

466
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,799
tool I'm using static input files that

467
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,910
have all of this and I've commented the

468
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,970
input files so that you know exactly

469
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,950
what it is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming over but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

470
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is available as well as a visual</font>

471
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">reference when you download the deck so</font>

472
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,280
again this is all of them you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

473
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,270
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> change locations change</font>

474
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">capitalization changes you can see that</font>

475
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are lots of different developers</font>

476
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,910
that are playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff so you</font>

477
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,890
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do a little</font>

478
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,150
diligence based on the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of iOS</font>

479
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,240
that you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking</font>

480
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,700
at my 43 slot up here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't find</font>

481
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and you're looking at a 706</font>

482
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,780
machine well the reason why is because

483
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,350
it's probably moved so you need to go

484
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,660
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at</font>

485
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,969
the newer information all right let's

486
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,580
look at some findings the keyboard<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash</font>

487
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:47,250
otherwise known as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple's native key</font>

488
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,590
logging facility this thing is supposed

489
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,750
to make typing much easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you using</font>

490
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,270
auto correct I'm sure we've all typed

491
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,789
shot or wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to type shit and it typed</font>

492
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,049
shot many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I hate that I don't</font>

493
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,179
know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times I've type shit</font>

494
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:01,559
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand and it still changes</font>

495
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:05,070
it to shot I don't know what's up with

496
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this thing unless you purge it</font>

497
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,780
manually this thing will continue to

498
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,789
build and<font color="#E5E5E5"> build and build so I've been</font>

499
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,830
using this device for just shy of two

500
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:17,730
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never reset my keyboard cash</font>

501
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:21,120
i have approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 19 months of key</font>

502
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,950
logging data on my phone this is

503
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,158
actually my daily driver so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

504
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,390
the time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is some stuff that I</font>

505
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,640
pulled out I was doing a risk assessment

506
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,220
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> client and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that you</font>

507
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,770
can you can put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete</font>

508
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,240
sentences from the keyboard cash so um

509
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,309
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have coordinate that through</font>

510
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,500
help desk just need make sure so imagine

511
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're Anthony Weiner and you know maybe</font>

512
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,650
you're texting with somebody because

513
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,870
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're typing into</font>

514
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,330
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's marked as secure and it's a</font>

515
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,320
mask data field is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get cashed</font>

516
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:54,720
in here some other stuff snapshots so

517
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,149
there's a cool effect when you hit the

518
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">HOME key on an iOS device it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda like</font>

519
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,909
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is it</font>

520
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,789
takes a screenshot of the open

521
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:05,250
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so potentially data</font>

522
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:08,309

533
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,400

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,549
for road warriors people that travel all

any apps that i don't analyze first so

540
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,409
i'll download them do a full analysis

541
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,178
then determine if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually want to</font>

542
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">work with them sometimes i send hate</font>

appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sometimes they don't I</font>

547
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,080
don't really care either way because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to speak with my wallet and I'm</font>

549
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,158
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for that app if it</font>

550
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:07,080
sucks so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one definitely sucks you</font>

551
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,070
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they support multiple api's</font>

552
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,350
here's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> evernote creds in the clear</font>

553
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,360
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my google creds in the clear that</font>

is my actual personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google creds so</font>

555
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,639
that's why it's fully redacted some

other stuff chat and social applications

557
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:26,490
instant messaging applications security

558
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:28,830
absolutely terrible these were two apps

559
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,950
that they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix the issues after</font>

560
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,230
I reported them to them so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:44,159
basically a configuration file we use

565
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,620

clear in the configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> file most</font>

575
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,110
commonly if you're doing mobile

576
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,909
application assessments you'll find

577

pop everything out there's some

590
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,929
sensitive information there so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocked</font>

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,120
delivering a talk similar to this one

594

and a customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up to me afterward</font>

599
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:58,559
I said no it goes well if you do would

603
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,570
was really busy

604
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,679
time but curiosity killed the cat and I

605
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,230
said you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what let me just go get</font>

606
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,480
this thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did these guys actually</font>

607
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:17,110
store all your chats in an SQLite

608
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:20,080
database nice what we have contacts so

609
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,149
all of your contacts yeah they're all

610
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,970
stored in the clear along with images

611
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,650
too so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a separate database for</font>

612
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,140
address book images I don't know if you

613
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,990
guys put pictures of your contacts next

614
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,809
to them so that shows up as well here's

615
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">male on iOS this is not nearly as bad as</font>

616
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:39,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android you're going to shit when you</font>

617
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:43,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the Android findings so I can see</font>

618
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:46,360
all of my exchange mailboxes my gmail

619
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,100
mailboxes and right here I can see

620
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,678
messages so that is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

621
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,370
messages and obviously they just fixed

622
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:57,630
an issue with with email attachments not

623
00:24:54,370 --> 00:25:00,040
being encrypted since apparently iOS 7

624
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,990
which I kind of laughed at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

625
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,750
they're not really encrypted anyway they

626
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,870
never really happen unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put a pin</font>

627
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:11,549
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device so that's pretty</font>

628
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,809
interesting and mo<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail so this is</font>

629
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:15,370
iCloud I started I turned on all the

630
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:17,110
iCloud sinking stuff and some

631
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting things happen to my machine</font>

632
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,100
all of a sudden some new directory

633
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:24,040
showed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile email mobile safari</font>

634
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:27,070
mobile nodes so all my stuff that i'm

635
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:32,620
syncing to iCloud is first cashed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

636
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:35,559
clear on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> device and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see this</font>

637
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:40,299
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is some mail and this is exactly</font>

638
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it's stored on the device so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

639
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:45,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stuff that showed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up if you look</font>

640
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,020
under user library mail all of these so

641
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,970
here's my exchange activesync so this is

642
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,860
all of my synchronization stuff your

643
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:54,100
primary mailbox is going to be envelope

644
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,659
index don't be fooled by protected index

645
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,770
it's not protected you can open it up

646
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> base and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

647
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:02,889
information as well and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

648
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:06,280
the thing that really scared me when I

649
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:08,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">turned on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff I'm like holy cow</font>

650
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,639
so this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens when you use</font>

651
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:15,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google as a corporate email solution so</font>

652
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,480
it's imap and what it's doing is caching

653
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:18,910
all of my folders

654
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,260
the servers and does anybody see

655
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,030
anything that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting in</font>

656
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:27,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's let's say you're a competitor of</font>

657
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:29,410
mine customers that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably be an</font>

658
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,500
interesting one recruiting interesting

659
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,900
research yeah so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

660
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:44,110
shocked and I'm not using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iCloud</font>

661
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:45,940
stuff anymore sqlite<font color="#E5E5E5"> no SQL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lite in the</font>

662
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,350
clear sequel<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher by the way guys</font>

663
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,150
there's no reason to have clear text

664
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:52,570
data in SQL Lite sequel ciphers been

665
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:54,490
around since 2002 it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast it's</font>

666
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,840
really light no footprint hardly at all

667
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,880
because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> created for embedded</font>

668
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,500
systems so there's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no reason</font>

669
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,620
for this particularly there's no reason

670
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,140
for Apple to be doing this or Google to

671
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,580
be storing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crap in the clear okay</font>

672
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,320
so I've got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo here there's</font>

673
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,120
also a voicemail database on here

674
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:35,168
there's two databases dedicated to

675
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:37,178
voicemails yep so that was a trust fund

676
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,500
I was getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trust fund set up and I</font>

677
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:40,600
was cashing some stuff out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one</font>

678
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,419
account into another all the voicemails

679
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,639
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've ever that I've ever received</font>

680
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,750
on this device are still on the device

681
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know when you go in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

682
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,840
hit delete you delete<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you're not</font>

683
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,360
deleting them you're deleting them from

684
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,720
the UI because the UI has a limit

685
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,129
they're actually still on the device and

686
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can recover them and play them with</font>

687
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,030
QuickTime this is iOS still nope

688
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,130
yeah well again I've had mine for over

689
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:13,300
two years I miss a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calls they're</font>

690
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,250
all there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the date and time</font>

691
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,419
stamps from when when they first showed

692
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:21,940
up so here's the voicemail database it

693
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,250
is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful and let you know who the</font>

694
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,780
sender was and who the caller was and

695
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,360
all that good stuff as well and then

696
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their AMR files this is</font>

697
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,929
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> voicemails actually look like</font>

698
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:37,239
network config so this network

699
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:39,010
identification dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> P list this tracks</font>

700
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,130
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network I've ever connected</font>

701
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,320
to with the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is Wi-Fi</font>

702
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,540
this is every single Wi-Fi network I've

703
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,730
ever connected to this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

704
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,129
too bad obviously there's some data

705
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,750

00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:34,219
for coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> out no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm playing</font>

846
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:36,110
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm scared too that's why I</font>

847
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyze all the applications that i use</font>

848
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,400
on these<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices number of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

849
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,699
we can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on who you are if</font>

850
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,889
you're a user then pay attention to the

851
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,839
permissions that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being requested of</font>

852
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,210
you when you install an application go

853
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,250
by phone view and do analysis the

854
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,870
applications yourself and say no to

855
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,480
applications that are not treating your

856
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:59,210
data appropriately inside the enterprise

857
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,800
mobile security policy from a management

858
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,290
perspective from an administration

859
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,500
perspective we've got we have to have a

860
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,090
really good acceptable use policy I hate

861
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,890
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate it hate it when people just</font>

862
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,840
shove security awareness down people's

863
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,549
throats but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> educate them as</font>

864
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,530
to why the policies are what they are

865
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if I have a policy against</font>

866
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,270
jailbroken and rooted devices I have a

867
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:23,570
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the knowledgeable</font>

868
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:26,660
individual to explain to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> why Jill</font>

869
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:29,530
threat to our enterprise obviously we

870
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:33,319
can see why right but for the unknown or

871
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:36,260
the uneducated they don't know so mobile

872
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,150
security education you need some kind of

873
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,530
management whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mobile</font>

874
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,210
application management is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

875
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,130
to go device management I could give a

876
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,990
damn what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with your device if you</font>

877
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">have corporate data on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device then</font>

878
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,620
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect that okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

879
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,200
solutions out there now where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

880
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,990
put pins on specific applications you

881
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,299
can do per application VPN tunnels you

882
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,339
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of really cool stuff so</font>

883
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,530
there's no excuse for us to not<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font>

884
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,870
have some sort of defense for our

885
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,970
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> offense of mobile forensics use</font>

886
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,859
this methodology go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some tools for</font>

887
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,000
your lab and start doing some real risk

888
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,940
assessments on the stuff that you're

889
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,430
doing inside and for God's sake if

890
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,880
you're developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile applications</font>

891
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,500
don't be a dick treat people's

892
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,330
information the way that you want your

893
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,280
information treated it is absolutely

894
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">pathetic some of the applications that</font>

895
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,840
are out there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

896
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:29,810
with our data so Samsung Knox I told you

897
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys that I hate it now I looked at it</font>

898
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:37,450
so this thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still not doing crackin</font>

899
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let me check this out real quick</font>

900
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:47,930
oh it is there we go so passcode 937 one

901
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:50,750
key bag version<font color="#E5E5E5"> three key bag keys</font>

902
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,460
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten keys in here and we have</font>

903
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">some additional tools on board where we</font>

904
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,450
can use these keys and go extract all

905
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,640
the encrypted stuff out of the key bag I

906
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,410
actually completed a moment I'll shoot

907
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,450
mobile application assessment recently

908
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,970
where I was like okay you guys aren't

909
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,100
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain for auth where the</font>

910
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,709
hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff being stored turned</font>

911
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,630
out they were storing their pen the

912
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,520
witch turned out being the encryption

913
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,460
key as well they were they were using

914
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,810
phonegap and in local<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage they were</font>

915
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,940
storing all the parameters for their

916
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,890
crypto library which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SJ</font>

917
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">CL because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just took all the</font>

918
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,029
parameters plugged him into google and

919
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ate SJC l came up along with a demo</font>

920
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,020
page where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could decrypt their stuff I</font>

921
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,720
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey that's awesome all I need</font>

922
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,660
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key so I was started running a</font>

923
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,000
tool called file ma I<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS which real-time</font>

924
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,920
watched file<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO real time on an iOS</font>

925
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,300
device and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were</font>

926
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,080
writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their key to the default key</font>

927
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:47,450
back so in this case I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

928
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">their secrets still because they hadn't</font>

929
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:52,549
limited the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of iOS that the</font>

930
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,310
application could run on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able</font>

931
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,680
to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on my iOS 5 device that as you</font>

932
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,509
have seen I can crack so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was able to</font>

933
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,339
crack their stuff too so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

934
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,530
they mitigated that as I told them you

935
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,310
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to require iOS 6 or above now I</font>

936
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,380
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the key bag get your keys</font>

937
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:12,470
and quit using local storage for crying

938
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:17,020
out loud anyways so that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful</font>

939
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:17,020
now let's look at automating this

940
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:30,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so where is it okay so here's</font>

941
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:32,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">the script now i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume that</font>

942
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys have not changed the password</font>

943
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:39,350
from alpine thank you sir yep we're

944
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing good so this is set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to default</font>

945
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,890
to alpine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up with</font>

946
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,570
parameters command line parameters so if

947
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,810
you've been smart and changed it from

948
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:50,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">alpine to something more secure and that</font>

949
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the entire world doesn't know then you</font>

950
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,090
can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in at the command line</font>

951
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,860
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> also take an IP address</font>

952
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:59,420
of the device as a parameter on the

953
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:03,050
command line as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so for now</font>

954
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,580
we're using a static input file I was

955
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,320
late to the conference today because I

956
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,180
was trying I've been trying all week and

957
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,190
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been busy distractions I wanted to</font>

958
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,379
spend as much time here as I could I've

959
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">been trying to do some dynamic stuff</font>

960
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,700
where I don't use an input file at all I

961
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,310
basically let you go tell me what you

962
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,689
want to get and it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more useful</font>

963
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:22,100
that way from mobile application

964
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,710
assessments because this is really kind

965
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,690
of set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for a full device risk</font>

966
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">assessment at this point because I'm</font>

967
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,490
pulling all of the interesting data off

968
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the device and what I'm doing is I'm</font>

969
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:43,370
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build it I'll show you</font>

970
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:46,160
here so in this directory sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

971
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:48,290
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this directory right here</font>

972
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,270
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an output folder</font>

973
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:53,300
that gets created and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

974
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:57,170
do is as I pull the information off the

975
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,700
ipad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to rebuild the file</font>

976
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,110
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the way it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

977
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,419
iPad so that way when you go back to

978
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:04,310
your Mac and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do your analysis you're</font>

979
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,020
looking at the exact same file system

980
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:10,880
essentially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were looking at on</font>

981
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:18,200
the iPad<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's run it we're one</font>

982
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:20,690
for one fuck you demo gods all right now

983
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:27,439
if this whole thing runs I ran it right

984
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:31,510
before I came over here and oh it would

985
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,510
help if the ipad was actually connected

986
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:38,660
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm connected</font>

987
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,660
ok

988
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,020
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to take quite a while I</font>

989
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it took like 20 or 30 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

990
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,800
actually pull everything down but it'll

991
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:52,870
pull enough stuff down that you can you

992
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:56,680
can see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the result is yeah there we</font>

993
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:57,910
go so I also have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bugs in</font>

994
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,350
here the reason I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> releasing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

995
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,270
today is I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been chasing bugs I</font>

996
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,350
actually release this to my team earlier

997
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,420
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the week and they've been beating the</font>

998
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,910
hell out of it and there's a number of

999
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,160
bugs in here one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my issues is that</font>

1000
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,770
when I write the directory the first

1001
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,779
time I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a satisfactory enough</font>

1002
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,610
check and what's happening is when I

1003
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,050
have multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> files in a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases</font>

1004
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,220
there's going to be multiple files in a

1005
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,440
directory that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull over</font>

1006
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they're all interesting what's</font>

1007
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,280
happening is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program is saying oh</font>

1008
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,569
hey the directory already exists on the

1009
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac so you must have gotten everything</font>

1010
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,040
so it's throwing an exception there so

1011
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,550
i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to fix that so if you guys</font>

1012
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,259
watch my twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's at JD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peloquin i</font>

1013
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:39,700
will tweet next week when I release it

1014
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:43,000
and it'll be available on github so

1015
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:46,450
let's go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of the output so</font>

1016
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,490
you can see bar mobile library so this

1017
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:55,930
is symlink to slash users on an iOS

1018
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:59,319
device and there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's</font>

1019
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,790
accounts and here's the account sqlite

1020
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,180
database we can go have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1021
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,180
if you want

1022
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so</font>

1023
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,700
that's interesting

1024
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,239
should be populated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with data there's</font>

1025
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:49,219
only one account in there by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you</font>

1026
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:49,219
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do almost everything you can do with</font>

1027
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:56,339
with base with strings and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if</font>

1028
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,259
you encounter you will encounter

1029
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:00,359
encrypted databases people that did it

1030
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:02,910
right but anything thank you sir

1031
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:05,219
anything that's been deleted in there is

1032
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,930
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really deleted so you can</font>

1033
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:09,979
recover deleted information out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1034
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,979
database using strings

1035
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,550
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just so you know</font>

1036
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,800
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy back there that does</font>

1037
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:30,050
forensics too so it's the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font>

1038
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,400
you do forensics on a PC you can recover

1039
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">deleted information all day long</font>

1040
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,410
you

1041
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,030
oh damn it

1042
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,730
there we go

1043
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,680
see

1044
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:14,950
hmm interesting I don't know where all

1045
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:23,450
the accounts went look at address book

1046
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:25,660
stuff might be getting corrupted<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1047
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,660
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1048
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,450
so questions

1049
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:59,808
while you're running in the context of

1050
00:45:55,999 --> 00:46:00,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">root so pretty much all bets are off if</font>

1051
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:02,269
you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean there's</font>

1052
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,299
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with jailbreaking as long</font>

1053
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:06,950
as you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it responsibly or you handle</font>

1054
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:08,779
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices responsibly afterward I</font>

1055
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:11,538
strongly recommend a firewall there's a

1056
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:14,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of really good ones on cydia and</font>

1057
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:18,170
you just have to be diligent change your

1058
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:21,710
root password early and<font color="#E5E5E5"> often run a</font>

1059
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:24,859
firewall and and obviously use a very

1060
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:27,799
strong passcode on the device but yeah

1061
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:29,900
you know my<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest beef with</font>

1062
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:31,999
jailbreaking is in is in the realm of

1063
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,039
parental control there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1064
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:36,288
parental control software solutions out

1065
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:38,749
there they all require you to jailbreak

1066
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:40,759
your child's device which is beyond

1067
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:42,799
stupid in my opinion you're attempting

1068
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:44,900
to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> those children from threats</font>

1069
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,400
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply opening them up to a</font>

1070
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,650
whole new realm of threats by

1071
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,450
jailbreaking device so i think that's

1072
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,920
ridiculous well<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys thanks very much</font>

1073
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,180
for coming out i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1074
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,450
hope you enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

1075
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:58,930
something today watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter next week</font>

1076
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,930
