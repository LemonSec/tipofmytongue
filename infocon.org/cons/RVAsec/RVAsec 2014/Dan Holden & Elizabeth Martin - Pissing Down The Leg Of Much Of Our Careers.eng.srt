1
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,520
this presentation is called pissing down

2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,320
the leg of much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> collective</font>

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,950
careers why are you people still buying

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,990
firewalls and IPS technologies or as the

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,919
file itself has been called firewall and

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,860
IPS suckfest want to give just a little

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,470
context into this talk today I've been

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,710
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with security over 20 years 15</font>

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:43,670
of that was as a part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDS IPS</font>

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,530
industry so a lot of my experience had

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,449
to do with of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course building and</font>

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,670
supplying those products with security

13
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:52,370
content six<font color="#E5E5E5"> years of that was</font>

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,780
development in both sea and regular

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,190
expressions you might be asking yourself

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,950
see yes writing parsers state machines

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,530
that sort of thing I was a part of ISS

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:06,259
x-force for 12 years and I ran DV labs

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,070
in zdi and I now and the director<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:13,039
cert at arbor networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Elizabeth</font>

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Martin had been insecurity about 17</font>

22
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:19,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">years so my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first job out of college was</font>

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,500
creating a process<font color="#CCCCCC"> for firewall change</font>

24
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,539
control management so I was all

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,399
knee-deep in firewalls so I would say my

26
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:28,039
first skills are firewalls and

27
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:31,009
networking but truly my first love was

28
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:34,099
IDs picking apart packets at the time

29
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,440
was a the love of my life and that had

30
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:39,800
led me to the rest of my career in

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,869
professional services so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan and I I've</font>

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,869
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in professional services now about</font>

33
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:46,970
I think 13 years so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little background</font>

34
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:49,429
dan<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I used to work together and</font>

35
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,590
while he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually writing signatures</font>

36
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:54,050
I was deploying the products out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,500
field and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the products in a</font>

38
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,670
production environment so Elizabeth

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,380
mentioned we work together we actually

40
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,670
didn't we worked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same company and</font>

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,530
actually didn't know each other at all

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,500
we've only been friends now for<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

43
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,360
years the reason why we're doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,200
because we'd like to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all</font>

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,510
with not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bash fest we all know we</font>

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,280
can do that certainly when we've you

47
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,470
know worked with the technology it's

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,760
easy to pick on it but what we do want

49
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is give you two different views</font>

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,129
and our experiences along this fairly

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,769
long career in this industry and and

52
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,560
with these particular technologies want

53
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:33,260
to give a few disclaimers

54
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,350
we we do have quite a few friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry we're not trying to well</font>

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,269
well a good portion of this is bashing

57
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,769
the technology it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome and to again</font>

58
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,830
provide you experiences and get you

59
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,810
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right if you leave this and</font>

60
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,120
think oh you know I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear a</font>

61
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,140
response from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my vendor you shouldn't do</font>

62
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're watching this on youtube</font>

63
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,179
don't bother your vendors already know

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,790
these issues there is no original

65
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,010
research presented in this anything that

66
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,310
we show you in terms of evasions is

67
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,720
easily Google you can look up<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

68
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,709
this stuff yourself so there's there's

69
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,450
nothing new<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're going to</font>

70
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">give some ideas to wear things of course</font>

71
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,280
don't work and do work each one of these

72
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,660
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can tell you we're built</font>

73
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,450
from the ground up completely

74
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,040
differently one of the common

75
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,739
misconceptions especially with say ids

76
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,450
IPS is you might know snort therefore

77
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,740
you think well they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same none</font>

78
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are the same whether you're</font>

79
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,209
talking open source of commercial not

80
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,000
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are snort they are quite</font>

81
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,010
different if you asked me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a particular</font>

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,510
vendor or even open source<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would tell</font>

83
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,980
you you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at this it's not</font>

84
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,120
so good at this they all have their

85
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,950
strengths and and weak so there's good

86
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,440
the bad and the ugly with each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

87
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,089
the technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and products right so</font>

88
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,370
certain products work well at certain

89
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,760
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other products competing</font>

90
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,519
products work better at other things but

91
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,530
one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to sort of make is</font>

92
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,690
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of claims out there right</font>

93
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,989
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many vendors make veni claim any</font>

94
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:09,200
claims many resellers make money claims

95
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,450
integrators etc some of those claims are

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,170
true and some of them are not

97
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:19,988
necessarily so and what I see most<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

98
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:22,250
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> field and my line of work is</font>

99
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,409
integrators our resellers that don't

100
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,140
truly have an understanding of security

101
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,180
and sort of maybe over selling these

102
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,000
technologies which i think is a large

103
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,680
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's creating you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know an</font>

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,330
environment where people don't truly

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,910
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the products</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

106
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,180
technologies should be doing so that's

107
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,260
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good and bad and ugly so why</font>

108
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,970
might you all by these security

109
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,740
products and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a small list</font>

110
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,660
in our experience you could probably add

111
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,750
more to it but there's of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,650
feature set is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GUI pretty how's the</font>

113
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,390
UX management one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most important</font>

114
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,219
things can the product produce pretty

115
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:04,560
reports that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> management that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

116
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,250
unfortunately a gigantic 1 i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,560
know the rfp response is that come back

118
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,480
what you hear from analysts perhaps what

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,450
you've used before in the past and of

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,520
course a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it comes down to price</font>

121
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,770
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in regards to features there's</font>

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,570
each one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my clients I talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

123
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,539
wide variety of clients on a weekly

124
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,969
basis and with each and<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual</font>

125
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,250
product and technology everybody wants

126
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,010
something different and honestly what I

127
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,490
see most often is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually</font>

128
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,890
want a technology or a product<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

129
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,570
compensate for a failure they've seen in

130
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,740
a previous product so they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

131
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,090
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a tunnel vision when they're</font>

132
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,280
picking their product<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just want to</font>

133
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,280
make sure it does this one thing that

134
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,590
the last product didn't do so in regards

135
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,099
to analysts this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

136
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,359
vendors have to deal with they generally

137
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,670
have to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these analyst</font>

138
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,280
relationships you might have different

139
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,080
stock in these analysts but buying

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,210
decisions are absolutely made based on

141
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,500
analyst you know opinion and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

142
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,239
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to realize with analysts is</font>

143
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,010
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their analysis is not</font>

144
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,770
based on the product or the technology

145
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,770
at all but based on the business where

146
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the vendor is in the market what is</font>

147
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,880
their vision these sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things it's</font>

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,830
not necessarily does the technology work

149
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,040
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not or what the feature set is or</font>

150
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,210
does it actually you know do anything so

151
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take that with a grain of</font>

152
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,229
salt and of course you do have companies

153
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,180
out there that attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

154
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,230
consumer reports of the industry and SS

155
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:40,710
labs<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICS a SC magazine you know does</font>

156
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,350
these sort of reviews right so there are

157
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know none of these are perfect but</font>

158
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:50,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you you have to look at a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

159
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:52,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">different criteria so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a large</font>

160
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,150
predominantly a large portion of

161
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,520
purchasing decisions are made<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

162
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,120
relationships right so there's a lot of

163
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,659
different

164
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,000
relationships I myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> I pick our</font>

165
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,100
products to partner with honestly at

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,160
this point maybe I'm little jaded but I

167
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,139
focus more on business and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
they run their sales organizations and

169
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:17,150
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the professionalism</font>

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we see a lot every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day we see a</font>

171
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,190
CISOs or directors of security or CIOs

172
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,050
picking products because favorite

173
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,469
relationship with this reseller and

174
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,690
that's the only product that that

175
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,419
particular reseller partners with<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

176
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,250
that technology or maybe you have

177
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">friends and buddies maybe you have a</font>

178
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,560
go-to guy and say hey what are you using

179
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,449
for blah and you know if your buddy

180
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,039
likes it and thinks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you kind</font>

181
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,039
of go with it so I think that

182
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,050
relationships actually have a

183
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:51,780
significant influence possibly more

184
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,880
significant than the technology one

185
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,070
thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention on testing you know I</font>

186
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,199
would certainly recommend that you

187
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,510
always do a proof of concept if you can

188
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,099
/ taking a third party I know everyone

189
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,560
likes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a third party opinion you</font>

190
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to take you know what a</font>

191
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,490
vendor saying on their data sheet you

192
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,780
know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fact but your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proof of</font>

193
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,340
concept is certainly going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

194
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,989
valuable than a third party<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

195
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,060
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at third party make sure you</font>

196
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,190
actually take into account what they're

197
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,080
testing criteria is right everything is

198
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,599
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> judgment based on a certain criteria</font>

199
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,370
if you only look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> judgment and not</font>

200
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,639
how they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the test its kind</font>

201
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move and be wary of the false sense</font>

202
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,020
of security so if you have a reseller or

203
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,579
integrator that tells you this is all

204
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,559
you need then I would question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

205
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,440
how do most organizations pick these

206
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,020
products on an average week i would say

207
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,990
i talked to somewhere about<font color="#CCCCCC"> five to ten</font>

208
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,920
different clients within a week ranging

209
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,050
from 500 employees to the fortune 500 so

210
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,180
what I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> most often I see scenario</font>

211
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,099
number one clients that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

212
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking for talking to you for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two years</font>

213
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,770
that have done nothing in security and

214
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,900
they call us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they say all right this</font>

215
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,780
year we're doing security for reals I

216
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,329
swear I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> $50,000 what should I buy</font>

217
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,610
and so we kind of go through the process

218
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:15,430
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> help them figure out what to buy</font>

219
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,490
second scenario is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cio marches into</font>

220
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,579
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSO's office and says these audits</font>

221
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,320
are killing me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy an IDs and this T</font>

222
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:25,420
so says well but we don't have any

223
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,300
people to manage it I don't care go buy

224
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,670
it we need the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FFIEC off our back well</font>

225
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,430
but we don't have a skills in house just

226
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,099
go do it so that's a second scenario and

227
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,260
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third scenario is they don't</font>

228
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">really know that they're buying IDs or</font>

229
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,180
some type of monitoring technology they

230
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,670
just call us and say why do i keep

231
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,160
getting infected I have this firewall

232
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,290
and why are all the attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,670
through and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of leads us</font>

234
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,980
down that path of increasing monitoring

235
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,260
so how do i pick products if for my

236
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,450
clients when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm helping them what's</font>

237
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work so essentially i need to</font>

238
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,230
look at the threats and the pain points

239
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,610
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what will actually be</font>

240
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,170
the most effective so you're wanting of

241
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,269
course to stop the threats you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

242
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,490
first ask yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright not what</font>

243
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,019
technology should I be buying but what

244
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm up problems of course am I trying to

245
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve and this is where we segue into</font>

246
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,860
picking on fire walls because I a couple

247
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago at a mobile conference in New</font>

248
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,190
York made the statement that i didn't

249
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,839
think firewalls were security<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

250
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,570
because I look at security as being

251
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,390
threat centric now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

252
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,680
moaned and hissed and booed and many of

253
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,870
you might disagree as well but let me

254
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,729
tell you what I'm thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so</font>

255
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,000
the security industry has always use

256
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,440
these ridiculous house analogies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

257
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,500
if we're going to do that I look at the

258
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,829
firewall as the front door right you can

259
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">open it and it allows access this might</font>

260
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,010
look familiar this is 10 Downing in

261
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,018
london england one of the most famous

262
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,819
addresses in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and i can assure</font>

263
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:00,399
you there's a whole lot more protecting

264
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,829
10 Downing than just the front door<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

265
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I look at firewalls more like a</font>

266
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:08,560
saloon door right we know there's tons

267
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,410
of access people walk in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all the</font>

268
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,760
time so I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better analogy</font>

269
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,319
now of course we<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here every year</font>

270
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,660
from Skylar town that this is real

271
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,160
security locks or security doors I

272
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,870
question that all right but you can add

273
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,089
more than just your locks of course you

274
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,009
can add you can add dogs which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

275
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:29,139
fantastic one of the greatest things

276
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:30,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I ever happen to mankind dogs</font>

277
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:32,769
are pretty neat because of course you

278
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,959
can use them to let you know if perhaps

279
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:38,139
exchangers at the door similar to your

280
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,589
IDs you can also train them to sniff

281
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:44,620
your bags like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Airport dogs right let's</font>

282
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,240
liken that to maybe content security and

283
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,509
you can of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> also unleash them on</font>

284
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,990
the perpetrator and so that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

285
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:56,050
very nice way to help mitigate so pretty

286
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:59,040
useful security then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

287
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:02,378
you've got the original and hack back

288
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,269
the gun which of course was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

289
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Chicago so she doesn't get to have</font>

290
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:10,420
this but in Texas this is used quite

291
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,009
effectively as a hack back technique so

292
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,649
perhaps a better analogy is not the

293
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:18,009
house but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the various ways that you</font>

294
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">would seriously defend a compound with</font>

295
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:22,480
all the various a Kuchar month that you

296
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">can have insecurities not just simple</font>

297
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,749
doors and windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

298
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,040
continuing to pick on firewalls I we

299
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,199
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel like we put ourselves in</font>

300
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,230
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this position right we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all said</font>

301
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,969
well we have these 65,000 fantastic

302
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,769
ports back in the day when we could look

303
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,689
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Etsy services and know what</font>

304
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,370
applications were running and then we

305
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:44,319
said well you need to cut all those off

306
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,850
right if you if you diminish the attack

307
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:47,699
surface because you have few reports

308
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,829
well then surely will all be more secure

309
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:53,889
well not so much right now we operate

310
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:57,309
over mainly three ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> 84 for 353 that</font>

311
00:12:53,889 --> 00:13:00,639
sort of thing and we're worse than ever

312
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:03,459
so thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charles doing nice job for all</font>

313
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,019
of us what 15 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago when we were</font>

314
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:08,529
all saying everything had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go over 80</font>

315
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,179
and 443 we got it we're there great so

316
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,399
now all the attacks are coming over 80

317
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:14,050
and 443 so the answer you hear from the

318
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,179
firewall vendors of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course is buy more</font>

319
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,639
firewalls now they're just called next

320
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:20,439
generation or as many people call them

321
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,389
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation so now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all</font>

322
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:24,279
running over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same ports now of</font>

323
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,870
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do deep</font>

324
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,269
packet inspection to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull all</font>

325
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,929
the applications out of those ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

326
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:34,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess that's the answer that</font>

327
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:38,100
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the problem that we created still</font>

328
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,100
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that that makes so much sense</font>

329
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,230
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some of the problems</font>

330
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,850
that firewalls actually introduced

331
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,860
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course the idea is you by</font>

332
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,630
security technology and it should be

333
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">solving problems not creating problems</font>

334
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,120
but it does we of course have the CIA<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

335
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,569
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> steve war be called it earlier the</font>

336
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,699
AIC and firewalls actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce</font>

337
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,990
issues well they might help with

338
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,479
confidential your integrity they

339
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,970
actually can cause availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

340
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,589
right actually I want to jump in and say

341
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,160
that i've decided that i'm taking the a

342
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:11,769
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CIA so I don't really care</font>

343
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,930
about availability anymore I've got 99

344
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:16,600
problems and availability one of them

345
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,130
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not my problem but but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

346
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,649
tends to care a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

347
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability so I'll let him go ahead</font>

348
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:25,630
and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but just this time</font>

349
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,189
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue I mean we</font>

350
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,230
are so wrapped up with confidentiality

351
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,120
and integrity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we oftentimes forget</font>

352
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,160
about the availability and what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

353
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,120
C&I matter if course you're not even

354
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,100
online or the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the asset</font>

355
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,009
isn't even available right so this is a

356
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,870
very common<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue in the industry and I</font>

357
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,180
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think these only</font>

358
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:50,170
you know become intersected and closer

359
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,599
as time progresses even some of the

360
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks against availability are now</font>

361
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,430
intertwined with other types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks</font>

362
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,800
many times application level so let's

363
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">look just real quick what is of course</font>

364
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,569
stateful mean well I'll staple means is

365
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,449
that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking a connection for</font>

366
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:10,959
validity and that you are tracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

367
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:13,420
it is an active connection right so

368
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,518
stateful was a great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you of</font>

369
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,149
course had botnets now that you have

370
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,610
botnets of course state can then create

371
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,730
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because every single device on</font>

372
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:30,370
your network leading<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to your business</font>

373
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:33,339
critical asset is a potential bottleneck

374
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,500
for an availability issue right that's

375
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,880
how DDoS works right so there's many

376
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">other ways that you can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this of</font>

377
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,610
course ACLs work great you can put these

378
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your routers switches you might say</font>

379
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,120
oh well then you know I have management

380
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues know there's in modern routers</font>

381
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,510
and switches there are certainly ways

382
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,370
you can do the management

383
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,750
so there's ways around this firewall is

384
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,240
certainly not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own answer you might</font>

385
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,860
be saying oh well that's of course all

386
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,900
fine and dandy but I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

387
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an issue well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Arbor actually does</font>

388
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,130
a a report each year called the

389
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,770
worldwide infrastructure security report

390
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,360
where we ask all of our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

391
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,640
know what was their experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> we D das</font>

392
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,230
and as you can see over half of them had

393
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,630
issues with their firewalls and IPS

394
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,970
falling down before the application

395
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,510
server or the application itself fell

396
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:24,350
down right so these certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

397
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,730
introduce availability issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

398
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,860
now that we picked on firewall let's

399
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,850
move on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS which is actually</font>

400
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,310
even more fun IPS has the problem even

401
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,520
worse way worse because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

402
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,599
serious deep packet inspection with IPS

403
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,730
you're having to do all your TCP

404
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,220
reordering you've got multiple packets

405
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,290
that are out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> order you've got serious</font>

406
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,850
deep parsing of the big protocols of

407
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,060
course that we all work over things like

408
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,530
HTTP regardless of whether you're using

409
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,869
a regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> expression is your signature</font>

410
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,560
the parsing for that regular expression

411
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,180
of work is you require are seeing to get

412
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,969
to that point think of all the encoding

413
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,520
you have to deal with around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

414
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,740
utf-8 utf-16 there's tons of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

415
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,240
an IPS has to worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

416
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,859
the point where they can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> match</font>

417
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,500
your signature right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

418
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,780
point of evasion testing against<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs and</font>

419
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,940
IPS and there's a tons of it you know

420
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can go back a dozen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years with the</font>

421
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,579
whisker tool it's been around for a very

422
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:26,000
long time and is only getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse so a</font>

423
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,440
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> review here Gartner likes to say</font>

424
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,270
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threat landscape changes</font>

425
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,390
every five six seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I would tend</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to agree back in the late</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 90s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font>

427
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,940
2000s right we had nice very clean

428
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,520
network issues this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say when</font>

429
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,060
firewalls and IPS actually worked

430
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,700
slammer IPS worked great at stopping all

431
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the worms could be effectively mitigated</font>

432
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,290
quite well actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is the</font>

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">last worm any of us saw was in november</font>

two thousand eight with<font color="#E5E5E5"> conficker and</font>

435
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,490
that was a pretty late comer right so

436
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,850
the issue is and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really what I</font>

437
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,800
think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs IPS died and firewalls</font>

438
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,428
essentially with it is when everything

439
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,918
moved

440
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,409
you had botnets were extremely

441
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,600
distributed all right a signature can't

442
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:13,549
track anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's distributed and</font>

443
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,110
everything moved to the application

444
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:16,580
level right everything we access is

445
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:21,019
through our web browser it's even more

446
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,869
so now that the cloud is here Java Docs

447
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:26,090
cell right all the various issues that

448
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:29,149
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with of course anything</font>

449
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">Adobe and now of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have all</font>

450
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,809
sorts of various aspects that now come

451
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:35,629
along with the multitude of these

452
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:37,700
threats with various motivations which

453
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:39,379
of course signatures have no context or

454
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,090
ability to match right they don't know

455
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:44,928
whether you're from Russia or China or

456
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,428
what matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> or when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or why which is</font>

457
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,980
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point right that's why they</font>

458
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:50,840
increasingly match against things that

459
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,610
don't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you have high false</font>

460
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,199
positives or you have high false

461
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,840
negatives and to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you you</font>

462
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,360
probably have high both and it's very

463
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,590
difficult to measure we would say

464
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,289
probably the most difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

465
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact that no one is measuring it so I'm</font>

466
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,049
embarrassed to use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture because</font>

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know everybody's used it since the</font>

468
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,519
dawn of time but it is a pretty good

469
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,200
analogy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what attackers do right they</font>

470
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,759
understand you have firewalls they

471
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,340
understand you have IEPs I understand

472
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,249
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a V right you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

473
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,189
in your compliance they can read PCI

474
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:23,629
standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like you can so they know</font>

475
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they have to work around and that's</font>

476
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:28,789
exactly what they do so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a</font>

477
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,470
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples here javascript this was</font>

480
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,980
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy and simple example you can</font>

481
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,629
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a simple function hear</font>

482
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,639
the alert function in JavaScript is how

483
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:42,860
you pop up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little box right so</font>

484
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:45,408
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see a box here and you can</font>

485
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,408
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're simply converting a numeric</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript it actually turns it into all</font>

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,210
the characters you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> below if you look</font>

a lot of characters for a very short

program now what happens of course when

498
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,550
you get realistic because this

499
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,010
is what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript really looks</font>

500
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:24,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I actually tried copying and</font>

501
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,660
pasting this exact JavaScript into this

502

504
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,370
try writing a signature for this it

505
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">becomes very very difficult i can tell</font>

all it's extremely difficult because the

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,760
includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript so you have multiple</font>

you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch this right so</font>

581
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,649
what is your problem in 2014 is it still

582
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,230
slammer funny enough still around in

583
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:29,178
some parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world or is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PDFs</font>

585
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,840
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is clicking on so ask yourself</font>

586
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,789
why are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still using a technology</font>

587
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,658
that was built for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem in the</font>

588
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:41,299
early 2000s<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right to further</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

589
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:42,529
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right early in the industry we</font>

590
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,299
all talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we write</font>

591
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:47,210
signatures for the vulnerability not the

592
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,649
exploit this had to do with well if you

593
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,539
write one signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's good for the</font>

594
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:52,129
vulnerability all the various ways an

595
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:54,649
attacker can craft the x-point one

596
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,270
matter well that worked again great when

597
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:58,100
you were you know going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after things</font>

598
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,480
that were warm based because you could

599
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,668
actually see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerability being</font>

600
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,190
triggered in the network traffic again

601
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:06,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment you move to content can't do</font>

602
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,929
it parsing those things again is very

603
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult and very slow I mean the</font>

604
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:14,240
performance goes down the crapper quick

605
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:15,529
so what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors did was the</font>

606
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,390
only thing they could do while they

607
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,370
start looked looking at more heuristic

608
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,380
behavioral type signatures let's start

609
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at the exploit it actually</font>

610
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,159
reversed some of your most effective

611
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:27,320
signatures right now are not

612
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,720
vulnerability based they are not going

613
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,090
to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CV associated with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them it's</font>

614
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,460
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem with IPS is that it</font>

615
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,529
was meant for these vulnerabilities and

616
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,570
now of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course compliance is asking you</font>

617
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:42,399
or your boss is asking you I read<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

618
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,399
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know heartbleed vulnerability</font>

619
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,340
so I can feel better we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can check the</font>

620
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,770
box you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a signature for it</font>

621
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,120
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get owned and you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

622
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say why did the signature not</font>

623
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,709
trigger that's the wrong question right

624
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,149
your vendor will give you an answer and

625
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,680
it won't matter what you should be

626
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:04,840
asking is did that signature ever

627
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:08,360
trigger ever at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like ever</font>

628
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,459
maybe in the world right you have

629
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,770
signatures that flat out don't work they

630
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,050
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you feel better I mean if you</font>

631
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,120
get owned look it up check out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE</font>

632
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,940
look and see whether that signature ever

633
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,250
ever fired if there's a user group or a

634
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">community that you can ask whether it's</font>

635
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,130
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of commercial IPS ask a</font>

636
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,720
question anybody ever seen the signature

637
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:31,490
fire tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them have never fired</font>

638
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,320
guaranteed half the signatures you get

639
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,790
every month from for Microsoft Super

640
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,560
Tuesday I guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll never see</font>

641
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,500
fire regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether you're</font>

642
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,350
getting targeted by those attacks or not

643
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,940
promise you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so signatures</font>

644
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,620
don't matter it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how many</font>

645
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">signatures you have it's not about how</font>

646
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,189
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> signatures you have turned on what</font>

647
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be looking at is do they ever</font>

648
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,530
actually fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right moving into</font>

649
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,179
application detection right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

650
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,710
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new thing well I PS isn't</font>

651
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,300
standalone market anymore we don't buy

652
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,190
that stand alone anymore now we've

653
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,899
shoved IPS and firewall together right

654
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,050
you take two crappy things and you put

655
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,040
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes it better</font>

656
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,540
you're still using the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

657
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,280
technology right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

658
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,320
application detection deep packet

659
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,330
inspection a lot of signatures a lot of

660
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,159
deep parsing it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing a</font>

661
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,899
matter of fact I PS was doing

662
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,670
application detection before next-gen

663
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,110
firewalls were right you just had to go

664
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually find the signatures and turn</font>

665
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,040
them on they weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> there by default</font>

666
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,390
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't wrapped into a fancy policy</font>

667
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,350
where you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage them based on</font>

668
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:32,300
application right so the issue is this

669
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,980
actually opens up a new field because

670
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,540
you are now whitelisting applications

671
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,310
potentially right the whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font>

672
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,440
don't black list or whitelist you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font>

673
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,210
list what is the policy that we're going

674
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to allow well if you whitelist an</font>

675
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,110
application most of those

676
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,430
next-generation firewalls led all of

677
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,199
that through well what if there's a

678
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,830
vulnerability in that application you

679
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,450
just let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> through so it's kind of moot</font>

680
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,820
you've basically whitelisted the whole

681
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,270
thing you're now no longer looking for

682
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,270
those attacks

683
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,010
of course you can make fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all the</font>

684
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,200
naming criteria here but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

685
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:07,030
question for Elizabeth and I and so many

686
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,370
has been is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this really a security issue</font>

687
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:12,220
right when she's doing pen test is she

688
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,560
using facebook for those not generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

689
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,690
would guess so that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

690
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,149
question about the ng firewalls what is

691
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,460
an ng firewall right what does it by you

692
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,270
so when we're talking to people and you

693
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,980
know they're talking about their

694
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,680
security plan for the next 12 months

695
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,260
they I think they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

696
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,260
ng firewall will protect all layer 7

697
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:34,330
threats and and minimize you know

698
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,070
infections and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

699
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">like actually I think what it does is</font>

700
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,120
all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I really couldn't</font>

701
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,100
care less about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care if people</font>

702
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,129
are out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on facebook to me all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

703
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,750
applications are really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an HR</font>

704
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,490
productivity issue I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care I</font>

705
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,680
care about the threats that are coming

706
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">through those applications absolutely</font>

707
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,730
and do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think ng</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> firewalls the best</font>

708
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,940
technology to protect against those

709
00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:02,110
threats yeah maybe not maybe not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

710
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:04,030
so it's it's sort of a this whole

711
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept with the ng firewall that it's</font>

712
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,720
buying you better security and I don't

713
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,080
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is I think it's buying you</font>

714
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,870
better control over your employees so

715
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,939
the other thing about IDs is what which

716
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:19,540
I'm seeing which i think is a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

717
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:22,180

seeing predominantly and I'll just pick

724
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,680
on maybe the uTM's and some of the

725
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,469
managed service or cloud-based services

726
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:44,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no visibility into the product</font>

727
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,480
right so I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management and</font>

728
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,600
the policy setting in the reporting has

729
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,570
severely degraded over the past 15 years

730
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,580
I there's so many products out there

731
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,580
that have sort of turned into the set it

732
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,409
and forget it so my big joke is well if

733
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,909
an ideas triggers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the woods and</font>

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,690
doesn't tell anyone does it make a sound

735
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:06,190
I mean I see so many you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know products</font>

736
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,590
out there that it'll trigger an event

737
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,570
and it tells you security event you

738
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,409
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what it is you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

739
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,810
what poor

740
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,850
of the packet triggered the event you

741
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,639
don't know if it was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know part of a</font>

742
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:22,240
content filtering event or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids event</font>

743
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,360
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that that's part of for</font>

744
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:30,250
myself at least when I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

745
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,949
IDS's the you know the challenge is if I

746
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,600
can't see what it's doing how do I know

747
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,520
it's working and maybe I'm a control

748
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,120
freak but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I need</font>

749
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,490
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> visibility in addition a</font>

750
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,070
significant portion for me of the value

751
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,740
in an IDs or<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS is being able to create</font>

752
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,720
custom signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

753
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,240
able to do is if I see some anomalous

754
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,940
DNS traffic I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a signature</font>

755
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,680
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> choose to</font>

756
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,320
specific eye peas and things like that

757
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,480
well guess what a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> products</font>

758
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,060
you can't adjust the policy you can't

759
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,790
creates custom signatures these are very

760
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:10,030
scaled-down versions of the technologies

761
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:12,159
and I feel it's just degraded the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

762
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,830
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> products and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually saw</font>

763
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,120
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> market right in ids because</font>

764
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,460
you weren't in line you could afford to

765
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,350
do deep packet and meaning deeper packet

766
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,970
and you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually provide context</font>

767
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,320
behind the event right you would have

768
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,780
tons of little data as to why it

769
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,360
triggered where of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you went</font>

770
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IPS world you were blocking so</font>

771
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,120
who cared well the problem was of course

772
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,740
then you didn't know why you were

773
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,179
blocking right because you couldn't go

774
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,430
as deep as you wanted to write you

775
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,260
triggered you blocked you moved on just

776
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,480
because you're generating events of

777
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,610
course as we all know now doesn't make

778
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,020
them exactly valuable and actually

779
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,540
there's a quote of the day which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love</font>

780
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,980
p kappa<font color="#E5E5E5"> door it didn't happen so if i</font>

781
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get a packet capture the data</font>

782
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,700
portion of the packet or some portion

783
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,590
whatever triggered it to me it didn't

784
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:57,220
happen and it means nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

785
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:59,169
couldn't agree more so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a walk</font>

786
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,640
down memory lane I like this part

787
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,520
because I get to pick on Dan a little

788
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,320
bit so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15-20 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just</font>

789
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">say when I start in the industry may be</font>

790
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:12,090
about 17 years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked at a 160,000</font>

791
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,700
employee company and we were evaluating

792
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:18,129
IDS's at the time the market was not

793
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,480
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined so we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> semantics coming</font>

794
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,300
in and selling us vulnerability

795
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,400
assessment programs as IDS's this is

796
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,360
back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day symantec had bought like</font>

797
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,030
layer 7

798
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,600
which is a technology or company that

799
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:32,920
has long since gone away but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

800
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,350
out in the field<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually</font>

801
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing assessments and doing pen testing</font>

802
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,939
those signatures that Dan was writing

803
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,700
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work they didn't stop me</font>

804
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,429
there was not a single and because we

805
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,429
were an IDs vendor our clients you know

806
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:51,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">very often had our products running and</font>

808
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">do the testing on a quarterly basis or</font>

809
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,559
something like that they had a pretty

810
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,600
good security program and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had</font>

811
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">some really good visibility well</font>

812
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,699
everything that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did to own their</font>

813
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:05,620
network they could not detect it or stop

814
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,809
it we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have cat-and-mouse games</font>

815
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,010
where at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day what they</font>

816
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way that they could actually</font>

817
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,110
detect us is to put pork control on the

818
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,700
switches right so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they saw us</font>

819
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,879
plug in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see a little bit of activity</font>

820
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,280
they would physically come and find us

821
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,980
so why didn't they work that well if we

822
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,320
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous few slides</font>

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,450
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well for the conficker for</font>

production environment when I'm breaking

832
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,710
into an environment I can't run exploits

833
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,040
against the domain controller are you

834
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,110
crazy I mean the exploits did not you

835
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:59,230
know necessarily they were but they

836
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't in a production manner meaning</font>

you run you ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> the really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chance</font>

838
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,959
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran an exploit against a domain</font>

839

840
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,919
the domain controller so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

841
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:12,580
creative and find different ways to

842
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,440
break in and in doing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we had</font>

843
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,960
to sort of find the needles in the

844
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,480
haystack and pug her out you know plug

845
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,510
away well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs we just look like</font>

846
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">normal users there's no amount of</font>

848
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:30,010
on an internal network so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

849
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:33,669
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big misconception that IDs and</font>

850
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:36,340
IPS worked great you know at its

851
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:39,340
inception 15 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> but guess what it</font>

852
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:41,020
never worked that great nothing has

853
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,620
changed it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the threat</font>

854
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:49,000
landscape was smaller and it did detect

855
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,679
those more prevail in attacks now we're

856
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,560
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different world right so we've got</font>

857
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,380
you know much more attack many many more

858
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,540
attack vectors many more infections and

859
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,440
botnets obfuscation and things like that

860
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:04,120
that are hindering the detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

861
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so if any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rob's talk</font>

862
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,290
yesterday he didn't have issues with

863
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,179
these kinds of threat based or

864
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,550
networking based technology stopping him

865
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,350
it was sneaky auditors that were busting

866
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,240
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right which it's the other</font>

867
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,850
technology and the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

868
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,339
is the ids and IPS as they absolutely

869
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,520
give you visibility there's value in

870
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,960
them in those technologies and I don't

871
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,219
care what technology it is any

872
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,350
technology that gives you visibility

873
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,060
into the the activity on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

874
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,819
that has value right we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have</font>

875
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,650
eyes and ears but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ids IPS</font>

876
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,590
specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would ask you how much</font>

877
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">value so this brings us to the</font>

878
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">fundamental issue of course you can't</font>

879
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,940
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> your vendor can only trust</font>

880
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,279
yourself as ice cube told us on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

881
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:52,450
album predator who do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i trust me that's</font>

882
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:56,260
who so so what I'm seeing in the field

883
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:57,910
so it again forgive me maybe I'm a

884
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,860
little bit jaded but I talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

885
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,589
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different clients and there's a lot</font>

886
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:05,170
of lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of knowledge out there so these</font>

887
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:07,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">are just a few examples of what I've</font>

888
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,000
seen in the field an example is a small

889
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care clinic they have about it's</font>

890
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,470
a non-profit great organization

891
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,020
something around 15 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 clinics around</font>

892
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,270
the city and they have a managed service

893
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:21,900
that runs their firewall which they

894
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">always thought oh this managed provider</font>

895
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:28,150
you know they take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of all of the</font>

896
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">security and so they had an incident it</font>

897
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:34,180
was a an attentional malicious breach

898
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:35,770
and the IT dude called up the managed

899
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,319
service provider because his account was

900
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:42,009
locked out and the service provider said

901
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,560
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's those mine me too I mean</font>

902
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">come on huge misconception they had no</font>

903
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,700
eyes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ears and you know in the</font>

904
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:51,940
network we really could not<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

905
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,140
what was what had occurred there was no

906
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,339
logging

907
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,240
you know none of those things were

908
00:35:54,339 --> 00:36:01,058
defined and part of that sure shame on

909
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,558
the client but come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a managed</font>

910
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,299
service provider do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean to tell me</font>

911
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:08,500
that you don't even talk about saving

912
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:11,859
logs so that was one example the other

913
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,960
situation can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back one the other</font>

914
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:17,740
situation was a small 500 employee

915
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,230
company in the financial industry they

916
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,930
were sold uTM's by an integrator and

917
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,430
literally told the CIO that this is

918
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:28,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need right because it's</font>

919
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:31,089
not all in one that definition means

920
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:34,808
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need so they're like why</font>

921
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:36,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell do i keep getting infected they</font>

922
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:37,960
didn't have any workstation hardening

923
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:40,630
they didn't have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other solutions in</font>

924
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,680
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UTM was going to cure</font>

925
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:46,750
all for them but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see of course</font>

926
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,169
you know the larger companies say a

927
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:52,869
10,000 person company and in this

928
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation they had a serious mail where</font>

929
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems so they they had something like</font>

930
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,829
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say tenri images a day so as a</font>

931
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:04,539
big problem they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did they</font>

932
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:07,480
recognize those failures and they sort

933
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:09,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cleaned it up they did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deploy IDs and</font>

934
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,250
IPS i don't i think one is running in

935
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:15,308
true IPS mode and one is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

936
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:17,109
promiscuous but they truly do get the

937
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:18,700
value out of it they use it for

938
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,670
investigations they use it for

939
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:24,129
visibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't say exactly what</font>

940
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,799
portion of their security budget they

941
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,299
spent on it but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a lot and they</font>

942
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:29,950
do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and they're</font>

943
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:32,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually using it properly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was a</font>

944
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:35,890
good purchase and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> working well then</font>

945
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:41,400
I have like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortune 1000 client that</font>

946
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:44,650
just spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 figures on ids and IPS and</font>

947
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,809
basically are doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in you know</font>

948
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,819
a heavily audited or governed

949
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,920
environment they bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

950
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:53,259
auditors and that just kind of makes me

951
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,140
sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my stomach I don't know they</font>

952
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:58,210
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the team to manage it seven</font>

953
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,920
figures<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much can we do with that</font>

954
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">much money and for a security program</font>

955
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,789
right but they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it because the</font>

956
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:07,050
auditors said so so that was definitely

957
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:10,210
a compliance check box

958
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:13,450
alright so some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we would</font>

959
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:16,450
do so of course as you hear many times

960
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,129
do pay attention to HD Moore's law it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

961
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,779
a pretty good indicator for of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

962
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,500
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is out there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available two</font>

963
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,570
attackers the IPS vendors do that right

964
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,550
the third-party testers all do that not

965
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:30,570
only they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soyuz of</font>

966
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:33,010
course things like canvas core impact

967
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,950
there's a company that actually supplies

968
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:38,470
all these companies with both malware

969
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,089
vulnerability and even signatures so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

970
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,669
the industry is getting so commoditized

971
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,890
things are so you know now rolled into

972
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,900
one you have price pressure the

973
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,120
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> a of course is now actually</font>

974
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,100
getting worse because things are now

975
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,310
being even outsourced at your vendor

976
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:56,380
level right so this isn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

977
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,549
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> said i wouldn't go now question or go</font>

978
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,350
beat<font color="#CCCCCC"> up your vendor they know all this</font>

979
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:01,300
stuff it's a fundamental technology

980
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,680
issue and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

981
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,500
day the way these things are deployed

982
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,759
and used so again you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

983
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you're protecting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what might</font>

984
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,630
best protect it Steve were<font color="#E5E5E5"> be I think</font>

985
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,900
earlier today had some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

986
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,860
examples as to how to do that

987
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,570
outsourcing is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those potential</font>

988
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,040
things I've certainly seen outsourcing

989
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,720
that was a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of course</font>

990
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,130
you didn't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

991
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,100
have the expertise you didn't have the

992
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">money sometimes that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

993
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,540
your only reason for outsourcing is

994
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,280
saving money probably a bad idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

995
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so i would certainly avoid the you</font>

996
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,730
know your mess for less because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

997
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,670
you're just going to get a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of logs</font>

998
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,980
and a bunch of logs doesn't really get

999
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,870
you out of anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these two bolded</font>

1000
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,810
items up here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Badger success over</font>

1001
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:46,270
time a measure failure constantly those

1002
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:49,000
are two key messages I try to really

1003
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,130
drive home with my clients you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1004
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,490
and again maybe I'm old and jaded but

1005
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:56,710
we're not looking for utopia and<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of</font>

1006
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,629
the organization's i'm working with

1007
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,040
they're building a security program

1008
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,460
right so they're a little bit less

1009
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,970
mature so my advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them is to just</font>

1010
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:09,790
constantly improve right look to make

1011
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:12,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">improvements or over a period of time if</font>

1012
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,529
you go into it trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have utopia</font>

1013
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,200
utopian environment you will fail and

1014
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,710
then in terms of measuring that first of

1015
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,750
all measure whatever you can write is

1016
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,210
whatever statistics data you can gather

1017
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,339
and collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and report on that's great</font>

1018
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:30,270
and as you implement different

1019
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:32,460
technologies monitoring etc I would

1020
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,890
expect that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting in your data</font>

1021
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,589
would increase right so if you deploy

1022
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:40,890
more tools and more controls you should

1023
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:43,470
see an increase in the incidence or

1024
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,529
events and and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a bell curve</font>

1025
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:47,700
right as you become more mature you know

1026
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,740
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a period</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

1027
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,319
where you ramp up and you increase

1028
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,479
visibility and you should see a lot of

1029
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,099
events and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good thing and your</font>

1030
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,790
success should be measured by<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

1031
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,830
uz where success is an increase and then

1032
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">over time as you you know implement more</font>

1033
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,790
controls and get more mature the number

1034
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of incidents and events you see should</font>

1035
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:11,099
go down but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a period</font>

1036
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of time really you've got whether you've</font>

1037
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:14,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">got an act of deployment of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ids IPS</font>

1038
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,990
or whether you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at purchasing</font>

1039
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,280
and again this doesn't matter if its

1040
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,529
standalone or not right it doesn't

1041
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,550
matter over if to you TM or next-gen

1042
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,980
firewall right they're all doing the

1043
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,750
same thing measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the events you're</font>

1044
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,130
getting right look into those and see

1045
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,380
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are false positives or not</font>

1046
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,570
look at your proof of concept you know

1047
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,830
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fire a</font>

1048
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,780
couple things at it with metasploit

1049
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,670
you're not testing the capability of

1050
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,230
that technology at all you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font>

1051
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,510
it in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-world environment and</font>

1052
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,550
measure that if you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to screw</font>

1053
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,530
with the IPS vendor and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit</font>

1054
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:46,170
it's hilarious<font color="#CCCCCC"> and awesome all you have</font>

1055
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,880
to do is change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exploit guaranteed</font>

1056
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you will bypass them it's not an issue</font>

1057
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,170
they are writing exploit signatures

1058
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,509
today it's all they can do don't blame

1059
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,339
them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to see a bypass</font>

1060
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,320
just go mess with the exploit a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

1061
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,299
bit throw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little JavaScript ovulation</font>

1062
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,960
in there you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> scoot past them every</font>

1063
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">single time all right you want my</font>

1064
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,140
opinion I think you heard it earlier

1065
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:10,439
today from others knock it off of this

1066
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,940
defense in depth crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generally hear</font>

1067
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,410
that right from vendors with very broad

1068
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,859
portfolios that want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to buy more</font>

1069
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,879
product that's what it sounds like to me

1070
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:20,130
stop you know asking what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1071
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,109
competition is doing these ice axe are

1072
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,510
very very useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have helped with</font>

1073
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:26,609
that level of ability right but you know

1074
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:29,130
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> target really care what TJ maxx had</font>

1075
00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:30,839
done years ago I mean it it doesn't

1076
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,509
matter right so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these attacks</font>

1077
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,919
are targeted at you right being in

1078
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,699
line with where the rest of the industry

1079
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:39,868
is it doesn't really help anything

1080
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:41,579
industry standards as I mentioned

1081
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:43,739
they're published everybody knows them

1082
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:45,929
including the attackers we all know

1083
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:49,799
compliance has now been proven to be

1084
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:51,149
near useless and at the issue you know

1085
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:53,849
at the end of day I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if either one</font>

1086
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:55,979
of us received<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know your your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

1087
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:58,339
time is a ticking clock you know the

1088
00:42:55,979 --> 00:43:00,899
first person<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get fired is to see so</font>

1089
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:02,880
you know that happens all the time right

1090
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:04,769
whether the company's stock price is

1091
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,380
affected their brand reputation is

1092
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:09,839
affected your job is affected right so

1093
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,219
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying especially from these large</font>

1094
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,619
companies where you that used to be the

1095
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:15,809
safe move right that's no longer buying

1096
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:18,029
job security that's going to produce

1097
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:19,829
what's called a resume generating event

1098
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:24,809
and your IDs does not have a signature

1099
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:28,409
for that so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell Dan</font>

1100
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:30,749
just shut up it all still works so what

1101
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:32,669
frustrates me<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite often let's just</font>

1102
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:34,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">refer back to my previous case study</font>

1103
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:38,249
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client that just cannot stop</font>

1104
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:40,559
getting infected don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me why your</font>

1105
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:43,709
firewall doesn't block an autorun

1106
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:46,259
infection go disable auto run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1107
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:48,808
workstations I mean come on defense in

1108
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:51,269
depth works muaks is talked yesterday

1109
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:53,729
about talking talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> using proxy</font>

1110
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:57,058
servers and and canary accounts there's

1111
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:59,519
all types of creative ways that you can

1112
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:02,939
implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls at different layers</font>

1113
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,948
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense-in-depth still works don't</font>

1114
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:07,859
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense-in-depth means firewall IP</font>

1115
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:09,739
sav anymore no no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right which is</font>

1116
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:12,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what people continue to buy</font>

1117
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:14,069
uTM's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what they are</font>

1118
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:15,449
next-gen firewall at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

1119
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,759
really all that is is an

1120
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:19,589
enterprise-grade UTM<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right you're</font>

1121
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:22,109
shoving a bunch of technology into one

1122
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:23,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing and when you do that things suffer</font>

1123
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:25,769
you're no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> good any one thing</font>

1124
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:29,819
you're mediocre at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and</font>

1125
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:31,618
performance is hugely affected SSL is a

1126
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:33,899
great example oh you want ssl on your

1127
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:35,699
security device good luck when you

1128
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:38,189
actually turn it on you might gain a

1129
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:40,619
little bit more visibility I'd measure

1130
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:46,730
that but your performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

1131
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">suffer incredibly so the good vendors I</font>

1132
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:53,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talked to all of them it's exhausting</font>

1133
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good vendors that sell technologies</font>

1134
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:58,160
that do multiple things they will be

1135
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:00,109
honest with you and and tell you maybe

1136
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,220
it's me because I'm a partner and you

1137
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:03,230
know they feel like they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1138
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,580
honest<font color="#CCCCCC"> than they are with the clients</font>

1139
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,310
but a good vendor will tell you

1140
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:10,580
precisely what the box is designed to do

1141
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:13,220
the resellers or maybe certain sales

1142
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,799
people or you know certain characters in

1143
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,439
the in the mix they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not understand</font>

1144
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they may be over selling these</font>

1145
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,910
technologies so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to be</font>

1146
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,160
careful about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and always ask the</font>

1147
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:26,390
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep program probing if you</font>

1148
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,460
don't feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've gotten a good</font>

1149
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer not saying people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are being</font>

1150
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:35,240
dishonest I'm just saying they may not

1151
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:38,240
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge I know if you hear ya</font>

1152
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,270
should we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it together if you hear</font>

1153
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:45,649
the words this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all you need run</font>

1154
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">shikata and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so really what</font>

1155
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:51,550
would we do again<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your technology</font>

1156
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:54,680
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have a signature for when</font>

1157
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:57,260
security fails right so I'm with

1158
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,060
Elizabeth if you can packet capture

1159
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,310
everything man there's there's a lot of

1160
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:03,500
technologies and just human power that

1161
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:05,900
of course can really dig into things

1162
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:09,830
deeper there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more you can</font>

1163
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:11,420
do so you know really you know PCI<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

1164
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:13,700
you compensating controls for all these

1165
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,440
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that they think might be</font>

1166
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,359
solved with these legacy legacy

1167
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,430
technologies what you really want is a

1168
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,520
competent control for all those stupid

1169
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:24,618
compensating controls you have to deploy

1170
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,710
so most of what I see the most effective

1171
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:29,359
security programs are those that

1172
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:31,070
implement controls and technologies to

1173
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,590
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the other technologies and</font>

1174
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,840
controls to fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so my content</font>

1175
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,570
filtering will catch what my<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS</font>

1176
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't my IDs and IPS will catch what</font>

1177
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:45,580
my firewall doesn't my endpoint will

1178
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:48,770
catch you know what well not much but

1179
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:51,619
something right macro viruses maybe so

1180
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:54,290
but in short these solutions each one of

1181
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:57,740
them all have value how much is

1182
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,779
questionable but plan for and implement

1183
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,529
your controls for all the other controls

1184
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,280
to fail

1185
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:06,530
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know- lifestyle the live</font>

1186
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,380
it's just kind of smart planning and

1187
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,520
designing I think so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

1188
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,170
I don't think we have any time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1189
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,660
questions but will be around for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

1190
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,340
more minutes here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you can</font>

1191
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:20,109
always abuse us on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter that's what</font>

1192
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,110
it's for thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>
