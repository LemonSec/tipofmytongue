00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,229
million endpoints globally since the

team was<font color="#CCCCCC"> founded in 2007 its approach to</font>

43
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,908
incident response was that based on the

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,679
concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Defense's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fail so you want to</font>

45
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,530
get really really good at detection and

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,110
instant response and the early GE cert

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,510
team did exactly that even with limited

48
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,310
resources the early GE cert built the

49
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,590
original team and systems to be

50
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful that approach in philosophy</font>

51
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,250
worked very well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> still serves us</font>

52
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,930
well today what today's GE cert is doing

53
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,060
is building on that great foundation

54
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,680
we're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best from the past and</font>

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,780
making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even better</font>

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,670
the purpose of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk is to share a</font>

57
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,069
series of lessons<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned from attacks</font>

58
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,958
that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked over the years we hope</font>

59
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,548
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take any ideas from this</font>

60
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,739
presentation back to your own

61
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:45,689
organizations so let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> started this</font>

62
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,430
graphic roughly shows our process and

63
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,608
it's very much like what every cert is

64
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,349
doing in some form or another we work in

65
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,389
the response area and we're directly

66
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:55,888
affected in one way or<font color="#CCCCCC"> another by</font>

67
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens in this entire</font>

68
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,790
process so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be the</font>

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">roadmap that we use for the talk</font>

70
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,328
stopping along the way to point out

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,090
items that we think are particular

72
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:07,859
interests we know not everybody in this

73
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,840
room works for incident response so

74
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,220
we've selected items from every stage of

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,549
the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we would have</font>

76
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,590
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in value for everyone just a</font>

77
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,349
quick overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process at a high</font>

78
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,359
level it's as simple as it looks the

79
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,340
step mark prepare represents our steady

80
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,889
state that's where we operate normally

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're documenting training and</font>

82
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,409
continuously improving our processes

concern arising from detection<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs</font>

86
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,979
through our response processes and

87
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,319
learnings from response are then fed

88
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,849
into prevention and once the dust

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,500
settles down from an incident we then

90
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,988
cycle back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our steady state of</font>

91
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,430
readiness and preparation and at the

<font color="#E5E5E5">great people so how are we doing all of</font>

94
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,948
this well it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be true that even the</font>

95
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,139
best defenses will sometimes fail we're

here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you today that for certain</font>

97
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:08,489

99
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,669
sense our goal in GE search should be

100
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,798
eventually to put ourselves out of

101
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,280
business however the reality is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

102
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,358
might never fully get there a

significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> portion of the economies of</font>

some countries depend on economic

105
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,229
espionage or cyber crime so there's no

106
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,049
shortage of malicious activity right

107
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,460
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> outright they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there right</font>

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a few trends we'd observe</font>

of sixty-three percent of our workload

for the sixty-three percent portion that

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,200
refers to mostly straight hacking of

152
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,430

a much bigger net compared to classic

someone has to process all those alerts

337

and you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flood people with</font>

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,870
sometimes your detection systems can't

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:50,699
keep up the very best indicators and our

346

alert which is better and never talking

certainly raise the bar for attackers a
