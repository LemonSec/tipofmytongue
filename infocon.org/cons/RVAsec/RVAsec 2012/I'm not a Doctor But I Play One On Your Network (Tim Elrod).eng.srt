<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so a little bit about us I'm Tim</font>

2
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,449
elro I'm a penetration tester for

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,369
fishnet security before that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,410
penetration testing healthcare networks

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,490
for over seven years finding

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,609
vulnerabilities vulnerability research

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,149
binary analysis that kind of thing

8
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:37,129
apparently I can wield an axe I guess

9
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:40,649
that's travail and I'm Stephon Morris

<font color="#E5E5E5">pentester healthcare healthcare is one</font>

11
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:48,750
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> assessor filled all those</font>

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,190
kinds of roles so so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start out with</font>

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,809
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little bit about why</font>

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,789
an attacker would care about a

15
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,099
healthcare network<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so so what</font>

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,750
data is there that somebody malicious

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,430
would actually want well you know

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,320
obviously healthcare systems are going

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,430
to have lots of personal identifiable

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,899
information right they're gonna have

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,180
your social security number there have

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,500
all that data they take credit cards

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,610
they're going to have credit card

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,409
industry they're going to have your

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,729
health data you know what what disease

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,700
is what medication you have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

27
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like you</font>

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,509
know political and social ramifications

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,680
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> John McCain in 2008 when</font>

30
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,200
people were worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he might die</font>

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,320
like any day now so that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of health</font>

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,060
stuff embarrassing things like mental

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,270
health diseases sexually transmitted

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,430
diseases things like that these networks

35
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,100
surprisingly when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,360
stuff we realized how important on these

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,809
networks are two places<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,970
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do keep people alive and then</font>

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,500
also you know with with health care in

40
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,600
general we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about some</font>

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,829
government regulations and how honestly

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,770
most of the time they hurt more than

43
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,899
they help you know Adam was talking

44
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,950
earlier about<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTI and how pc i was you</font>

45
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,439
know you kind of hated it and stuff like

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,060
that and we kind of agree but it's way

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,429
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has so</font>

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,110
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wish we could get to pci for</font>

49
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare and we're not even that far</font>

50
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet so that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be amazing all right</font>

51
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,440
so our talk we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a suite</font>

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,649
that's

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,690
yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

54
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:20,180
common health care protocols and systems

55
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:22,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see hl7 dicom the</font>

56
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,990
history of them how they became

57
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,340
standards and the problems with them but

58
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically some things permeate</font>

59
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,560
throughout these things most of them are

60
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,530
non-standard standards created by

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,980
committees in garages sometime in the

62
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,940
70s or 80s and doctors all insist on

63
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,980
doing things very differently so there's

64
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">no real standardization and every system</font>

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,280
is you know customized to the nines and

66
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,279
they're pretty pretty special systems

67
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,130
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> by like legacy vertical IT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font>

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,320
standpoints yeah so the main vendors in

69
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">health care these days if you see a huge</font>

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare vendor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guaranteed that that</font>

71
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,960
product started in some guys garage

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,700
usually in the 80s<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

73
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,230
where that thing came from and good

74
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,350
things have come from those places<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

75
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,880
just grew<font color="#E5E5E5"> up these haven't yet so we</font>

76
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,109
looked at we looked at two protocols

77
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,910
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stefan was saying we looked at</font>

78
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,430
dicom which we'll talk about later and

79
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,459
we looked at hl7 hl7 was kind of the

80
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,100
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I did this is just basically</font>

81
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,500
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a glue glue</font>

82
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,030
technology so the purpose of it being is

83
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,160
it's a protocol to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass data between</font>

84
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,550
disparate systems in a hospital system

85
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,470
so when you go check into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hospital and</font>

86
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get admitted they put you into the</font>

87
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,780
admittance system right to take out your

88
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,640
information they'll MIT you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,200
hospital so you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,540
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out over and over and over</font>

91
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">again they'll send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hl7</font>

92
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,650
routers across the network so that you

93
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,480
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that system in like a drug</font>

94
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,810
dispensing system maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a radiology</font>

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,000
system you know things like bedside EMR

96
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,860
systems billing systems all that stuff

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,940
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data gets transmitted</font>

98
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,500
throughout the hospital through these

99
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,700
disparate systems that talk different

100
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,590
languages all through hl7 so hl7<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind</font>

101
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,010
of this glue protocol that holds

102
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,340
hospitals together it's a clear text

103
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,810
protocol like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90</font>

104
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,180
nine point nine percent of the things in

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">health care we tend to don't believe in</font>

106
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,329
encryption this is simple text based

107
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol segments are the women de</font>

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,810
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those are further defined by</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">carets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you get subfields in there and</font>

114
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,850
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about what hl7</font>

115
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,960
message looks like so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very</font>

116
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">very basic hl7 message it's an msh</font>

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,710
message so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with an m</font>

118
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,570
sh header this is just basically a

119
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,830
check-in message so somebody checked

120
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,750
into a hospital this is the type of

121
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,880
message we would see so you get the

122
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,500
patient<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifiers right John Doe</font>

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,389
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the next of kin</font>

124
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,729
field where it talks about their next to

125
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,729
pin information<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payment information</font>

126
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:08,430
things like that this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

127
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">one you'll have you know hundreds of</font>

128
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,020
thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different combinations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

129
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">these in the hl7 standard and these are</font>

130
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,830
flying across the network at thousands

131
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,750
of times a second right so you can

132
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine like how trying to write parsers</font>

133
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,580
for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very difficult</font>

134
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,870
for a developer all right because

135
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,639
everybody Under the Sun wants every type

136
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,320
of message fields they can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

137
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,849
they have to write parsers for this

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,020
stuff these parsers have to go extremely

139
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,940
fast because they said at the core of

140
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,469
these hospitals and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data is very</font>

141
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,690
important so they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually written in</font>

142
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,340
things like see that's getting better

143
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,200
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> some stuff in different</font>

144
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,760
different languages lately but a lot of

145
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,800
them were written and see a lot of them

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">sit on big huge systems at the core</font>

147
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,000
these hospitals and they just run and

148
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,870
parse this data so parsing text and see

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,310
is never a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea but so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

150
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,330
we've we've found some vulnerabilities

151
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,950
around that things like that with these

152
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,169
hl7 routers like I've been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

153
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,700
these are usually huge servers that are

154
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,500
critical to hospitals they'll sit in the

155
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,120
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hospital network these are</font>

156
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,610
what takes the data in from all the

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,229
systems massages the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and changes it</font>

158
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,669
to the to the way that the system that's

159
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:13,400
retrieving it will understand and then

160
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">ship to back out through hl7 channels</font>

161
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,080
you'll see these on a network they're

162
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,550
usually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

163
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,490
they'll have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand different</font>

164
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,650
ports open<font color="#E5E5E5"> high port ranges because</font>

165
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,379
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> application will have its own hl7</font>

166
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,210
port to send to and to receive from so

167
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:29,979
you think every system in a hospital

168
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,409
every application in a hospital the tops

169
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,270
hl7 talks to this box over their own

170
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:36,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific port all right so you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

171
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,969
to have you know 5,000 ports open it's

172
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:42,280
crazy all these come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> text-based clear</font>

173
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:45,430
text really fast across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network talk</font>

174
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,039
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other this is you know kind of</font>

175
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,419
the basis around<font color="#E5E5E5"> where like electronic</font>

176
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,490
medical record systems and things like

177
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,490
that started so they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

178
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,080
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> an apport scan is one of the yeah</font>

179
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,060
all those yeah you can definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

180
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,289
what a what a hl7 router is or it'll be

181
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,360
called something like an interface

182
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,680
engine right you'll see like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hostname</font>

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,090
like interfaces or something like that

184
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,580
hospitals tend to not call them hl7

185
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,750
routers to call them interface engines

186
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,310
so they'll say you know our interface

187
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:16,509
engine is this or whatever facts and I

188
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">com alright so packs what is it it's a</font>

189
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:21,430
obviously the picture archiving and

190
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,650
communication system it's a you know a

191
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,830
combination between medical records

192
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:30,219
pictures and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FTP</font>

193
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:32,710
essentially when you break<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down these</font>

194
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:35,050
are for<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-ray CTS MRIs any kind of</font>

195
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:40,690
medical imaging you're going to see you

196
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,520
know pack systems running dicom so dicom

197
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,400
can be broken down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different</font>

198
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,830
things there's the network protocol and

199
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,330
then there's the file format and both of

200
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:55,508
them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of crazy so the network</font>

201
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,568
protocol itself can be found running on

202
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:02,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP and UDP typically clear text on port</font>

203
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:05,680
104 you'll also see it on on 11 12 there

204
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:08,349
are off and encrypted versions and they

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,029
have their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> set ups and you pretty</font>

206
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:12,250
much never see them but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do see</font>

207
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:17,199
something sitting around on it 10 761 or

208
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:22,419
2762 that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very likely a unicorn of a</font>

209
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,830
dicom system so you know Parrish it some

210
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the terminology here you know it's</font>

211
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty easy but it's a little different</font>

212
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,770
service class users are just clients

213
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,349
right and served<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Klaus providers are</font>

214
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,490
just

215
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:36,789
you need to connect course with the IP

216
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,950
port and an AE title which is often the

217
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,760
name of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system or some other</font>

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sau is require depending on how</font>

220
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,550
they're set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the AE title of the</font>

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,460
client to be correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> Norton connect and</font>

222
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,560
often the IP address as well but not

223
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,810
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you can just connect if</font>

224
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,910
you know the AAA title and you can start

225
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:06,520
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and putting in etc messages and</font>

226
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know images and so you can see some</font>

227
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the commands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are there like see</font>

228
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,670
store so you get see<font color="#CCCCCC"> movie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etc and so</font>

229
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,439
forth it's very ftp ish and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really</font>

230
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,319
makes a lot of sense when you start

231
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,310
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in writing your own</font>

232
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">little applications for so easy to</font>

233
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,520
understand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of it not</font>

234
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">just in hospitals but all over the</font>

235
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,370
internet too so if you go just scanning

236
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,110
for these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sure some of these</font>

237
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,660
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't but I confirmed a</font>

238
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,150
number of them by hand that yeah you

239
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,620
leave in map running 24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

240
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,780
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a whole bunch opened I</font>

241
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,300
comport on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet they're out</font>

242
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,880
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can root them just like</font>

243
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could internally for a network test</font>

244
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,430
and they're they're really kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

245
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,510
special they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so</font>

246
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,839
these systems are going to hold things

247
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,540
like CT scans right full body scans

248
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,860
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hold radiation images</font>

249
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,130
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hold things like</font>

250
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,630
cat-scans things like that yeah that's

251
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,730
on the inner<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet those</font>

252
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:13,270
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> live on the Internet that was a scan</font>

253
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,770
835 room from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so yeah I</font>

254
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,420
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are out there and you</font>

255
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,180
can you can go look at people's x-rays

256
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's you know CTS and head scans</font>

257
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,599
and things like that those things are

258
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,420
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there anything replace them you can</font>

259
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">upload them you can change things right</font>

260
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,270
and they're not just images they are a

261
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,700
whole medical record stuffed inside what

262
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,860
appears to be an image so you'll see

263
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,990
that a little bit and just how they

264
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,379
accomplish it so when you break the the

265
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">file format down</font>

266
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:45,649
or one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these images it makes a lot of</font>

267
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,478
sense it's like a typical tlv<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup you</font>

268
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,299
know you have your type made up of the

269
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:54,199
tags the group number<font color="#CCCCCC"> l pin number and</font>

270
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:56,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VR of the length and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the value of</font>

271
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,998
that thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so far so good pretty</font>

272
00:10:56,869 --> 00:11:01,609
easy format for anyone who's dealt this

273
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:05,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff but then you start getting</font>

274
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:07,220
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> dicom territory so here's an</font>

275
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:10,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of data element with an</font>

276
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:14,389
implicitly are defined as a sequence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

277
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:16,909
items of undefined length containing two

278
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,739
items where one item is a explicit

279
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:21,379
length and the other item is of

280
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:25,759
undefined length does that make any

281
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:27,829
sense to you doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me I mean I</font>

282
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,869
gotta find a developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can write a</font>

283
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,508
parser for that that doesn't break yeah

284
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:34,549
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the stuff of the undefined</font>

285
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:40,759
lengths coming in and all that and then

286
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:42,829
some other fun bits about it as it also

287
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:47,059
contains embedded image data so your

288
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:49,849
multiple images either pixel data as and

289
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:53,988
you then coat it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> or le jpg JPEG LS or</font>

290
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:56,149
JPEG 2000 let's see what else we've got

291
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:57,669
yes data elements can be required

292
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,589
conditional optional fixed length

293
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:02,329
undefined nested so you can mess the

294
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,609
whole thing's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire thing can be</font>

295
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:07,519
big Indian or little Indian so the bite

296
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:09,859
orders not necessarily even known until

297
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,239
you start trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it retired</font>

298
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:14,479
private<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myriad of other confusing</font>

299
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:16,129
options but the real kicker is for those

300
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:18,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">VRS there's at least a thousand</font>

301
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:20,929
registered in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard itself and</font>

302
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,879
there are many many more unregistered

303
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:25,100
and then private ones which are never

304
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,449
intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> registered because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

305
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:32,689
system is kind of its own special

306
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:34,998
creature so so yeah so what we decided

307
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:37,098
to do right obviously kind of from from

308
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,479
our background doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of like</font>

309
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,769
binary exploitation and things like that

310
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,809
we thought hey you know why don't we

311
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:43,879
fuzz these things see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

312
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:45,379
anything in them because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

313
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,389
at the data itself in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

314
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:48,600
standard you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you think if somebody</font>

315
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:50,730
tried to write a parser for

316
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,750
there's no way right in no way

317
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,269
somebody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write a part that</font>

318
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not going to fall apart so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

319
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought you know we can write some</font>

320
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,220
puzzlers for this or we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use peach so</font>

321
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,979
we decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use speech because it's a</font>

322
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,220
lot better than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would have done</font>

323
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:08,490
so we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> two two protocols we wrote</font>

324
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,009
buzzers for hl7 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dicom the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dicom file</font>

325
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,240
format and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dicom network one the</font>

326
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">dicom network one was really easy</font>

327
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of took an ftp one and</font>

328
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:18,180
put see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of all the ftp commands</font>

329
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,420
and they all seemed work so we were good

330
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,430
left we're kind of taking some other

331
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,319
ones as people have suggestions and

332
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,229
things you know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of going back a</font>

333
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:29,550
little bit to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dicom stuff you know</font>

334
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,410
we start talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's these</font>

335
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,319
thousand registered<font color="#E5E5E5"> v ours and then the</font>

336
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,910
unregistered<font color="#CCCCCC"> vrs so the unregistered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vr</font>

337
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:38,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the reason those are there is as</font>

338
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,009
doctors want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be their own special</font>

339
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,380
snowflake like more so than even like

340
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:45,149
security researchers which is if you

341
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">know he researches right everybody wants</font>

342
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:49,740
to be kind of their own special thing

343
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,709
and and doctors are way worse than<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

344
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,810
us so what you'll find is that you'll

345
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:58,800
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these dicom systems that have</font>

346
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,630
special dicom viewers the images taken

347
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,758
out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dicom system can only be</font>

348
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:07,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">viewed in their particular application</font>

349
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i'll kind of give you guys a</font>

350
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:10,740
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a preview of kind of</font>

351
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,750
what's coming a little bit later but

352
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,939
think about if you have this image

353
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,220
format and it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be viewed in your</font>

354
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:20,370
viewer and you have to give those images

355
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,550
to patients that then have to take those

356
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">images to other doctors and things start</font>

357
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,639
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like working that through in</font>

358
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:28,439
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> head and think about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad that</font>

359
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,649
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

360
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:34,019
that here in a little bit um so back to

361
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:35,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fuzzies um you know as we as we find</font>

362
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,199
some stuff there's some other medical

363
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,399
protocols that we we kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

364
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,829
look at in the future there's a billing

365
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,449
protocol that specifically for health

366
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,739
care that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of want to take a look</font>

367
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">at cuz I think it's kind of cool but I</font>

368
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:50,550
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really had time yet and a couple</font>

369
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:52,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other things but we'll talk a little</font>

370
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,599
bit about about your medical records

371
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,000
you're going to take this sure

372
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,279
so let's talk about electronic health

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,800
records or medical record systems so

374
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,649
you'll see EHR and EMR fused relatively

375
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,149
interchangeably not quite the same

376
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on who you're talking to but</font>

377
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:13,029
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much they're both central</font>

378
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,850
repositories for inputting doing and

379
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,540
storing your health<font color="#E5E5E5"> information or</font>

380
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,889
health records from a variety of systems

381
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,189
they include you know billing pack

382
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:25,779
systems practice management systems

383
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,310
prescription<font color="#E5E5E5"> drug systems vital</font>

384
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,689
monitoring system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the things</font>

385
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,689
you're actually hooked up to in a

386
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:35,130
hospital business<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner systems which</font>

387
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:37,329
is interesting and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font>

388
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,850
the number of records in these systems

389
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:43,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is astounding they are extremely juicy</font>

390
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:48,790
targets because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just get so much</font>

391
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:52,899
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that leads us to</font>

392
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:55,000
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the next step right so in in the</font>

393
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,130
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stimulus act right they just</font>

394
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,069
came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while back that was part of</font>

395
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,720
it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care called the HITECH Act</font>

396
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:04,089
what the HITECH Act did was it would

397
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,949
offer stimulus money to hospital systems

398
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:09,220
if they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> show what's called</font>

399
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:12,639
meaningful use meaningful use basically

400
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:16,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">breaks down to your HIPAA compliant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

401
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,899
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means you have an EMR</font>

402
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:22,209
system and you participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an hie or</font>

403
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,649
a health information exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

404
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:25,660
so not only did they give stimulus money

405
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,790
for that but starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in October of 2015</font>

406
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,100
there are penalties if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't do that</font>

407
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,750
namely they take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Medicare</font>

408
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,189
reimbursement<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so for a</font>

409
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,600
hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> not getting Medicare</font>

410
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:37,240
reimbursement will shut you down in

411
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,620
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two days yeah so there are real</font>

412
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,079
penalties for these people to not do

413
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,490
that so they're being forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

414
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,000
government regulation to adopt this

415
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,410
technology they don't have a choice

416
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,899
health<font color="#E5E5E5"> information exchanges are</font>

417
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,480
companies they're usually regional

418
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,370
sometimes nationwide that will take data

419
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,160
feeds in from hospitals usually through

420
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,769
hl7 parse those and then send those back

421
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,509
out to other hospitals in the region the

422
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,339
theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind this is it stops fraud</font>

423
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:06,620
right I can't go to EMR one

424
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">gr1 get a prescription for oxy cotton</font>

425
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,279
and then go to ER to and say my back

426
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,990
hurts and get another prescription for

427
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,699
oxy cotton<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then go sell it</font>

428
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,329
on the street or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever that's what</font>

429
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:20,949
they're designed to do what they

430
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:23,918
actually do is they take in data and

431
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,720
then they propagate it to other host

432
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,390
right so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take in any type of data</font>

433
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,620
and they send it out to everybody so

434
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,289
they can send it out to everybody in a

435
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,850
region maybe everybody nationally sounds

436
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a really good virus propagation to</font>

437
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:41,178
me so I'll tell just a couple of stories

438
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,850
about some of these hie s after we gave

439
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:45,890
this talk at Def Con there was a large

440
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,428
hie that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us and approached us</font>

441
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,200
and wanted us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to a test for them</font>

442
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,789
because we talked about hl7 and they'd

443
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,860
been looking for somebody that could

444
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:56,000
understand hl7 and test it and

445
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,439
apparently they hadn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to find</font>

446
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,830
anybody we talked about it they got

447
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,350
really excited came to us and so they

448
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,970
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to come to a test great they</font>

449
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,559
saw our talk they saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck-up talk</font>

450
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,330
about buzzers and how we were fuzzing

451
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,100
hl7 for memory corruption bugs and all

452
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,090
that stuff I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their place I</font>

453
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,918
look at the code it's all written in

454
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:17,928
Java so so I spent a week out there and

455
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,899
sometimes you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we found</font>

456
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,309
bugs in in in these hl7 systems that

457
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,918
really buffer overflows and stuff but

458
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,658
sometimes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really that hard with</font>

459
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,539
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular system you know it was</font>

460
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:31,970
it was written in Java they had a type

461
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,529
of client authentication certificate

462
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,659
that they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using client certificate</font>

463
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,860
in a web service to authenticate and I

464
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,270
thought hey let's let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what we can</font>

465
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,408
do if we pulled that search get out of

466
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,730
the application and put it in the

467
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,490
browser and went to the web service and

468
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,860
I did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like Tomcat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ward employer</font>

469
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,179
came up so if anybody is a pen tester

470
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,840
they know that like that is that's

471
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:52,100
instant you know gratification there so

472
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,760
sometimes those bugs like that kind of

473
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,350
are there too so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um a war file</font>

474
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,379
yeah deploy war file got shell off these

475
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,459
boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like that but these are</font>

476
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,860
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are systems that are</font>

477
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:09,070
controlling medical records for people

478
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:11,059
across like the entire country<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so</font>

479
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,500
you know we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we talked</font>

480
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how it's bad right I can I can do</font>

481
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad things if I can inject a message</font>

482
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,229
right so if I could send something

483
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,639
could send a malicious message or

484
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,560
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that it might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

485
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">get through your EMR that might then</font>

486
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,679
propagate through the hie system to

487
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,930
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people's emrs and things like that</font>

488
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">but you know I'd have to be on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

489
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,890
network to do that things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

490
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,270
how would i do that if i wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

491
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,810
know how could<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do that from say the</font>

492
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet well personal health records</font>

493
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:41,450
that's a fun way of getting your message

494
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,720
into an hie or if well more directly a

495
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,760
hospital or some sort of provider first

496
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,930
there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a couple of big ones</font>

497
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health bolt is the only one</font>

498
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,520
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> still around there are</font>

499
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:55,790
some yep Google retired there's thank

500
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you google and they helped their users</font>

501
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,700
migrated to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft so that was kind</font>

502
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:04,340
of them there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some others that are</font>

503
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,500
bundled often with<font color="#CCCCCC"> emrs and EHRs that</font>

504
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:10,129
are rather proprietary and just they're

505
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,060
not seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much but they exist and all</font>

506
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,800
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're</font>

507
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,500
patient facing web<font color="#E5E5E5"> portal so you can log</font>

508
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">in to them you can have your medical</font>

509
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,790
records push to them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your in a</font>

510
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,170
doctor's office or the hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

511
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,040
visit you can put in your own

512
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:27,500
information all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you can</font>

513
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,240
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of preventative kind of</font>

514
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,980
measures and that sort of thing that

515
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,330
people like to populate these records

516
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,730
with and some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should be said</font>

517
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,010
is that yeah they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> bi-directional as</font>

518
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,470
far as which way the data can flow from

519
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:48,080
them so doctors will pull in information

520
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:50,210
directly from your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pH are helpful is</font>

521
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,860
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice actually like when you're</font>

522
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,110
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it from a development</font>

523
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,750
standpoint great<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doc's you know nice</font>

524
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:59,209
sandbox environment good<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDK like easy</font>

525
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:03,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to write for and third parties create</font>

526
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:06,080
all kinds of content for various

527
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:08,110
applications web apps and other pieces

528
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">of software that connect to it for like</font>

529
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">like nikes got some devices and things</font>

530
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:17,810
like that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as home health devices</font>

531
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,149
so the data storage for it can be

532
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,250
entirely in health bulk or it can reside

533
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,040
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the applications local database or</font>

534
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,230
other storage locations and users must

535
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,428
grant access to each individual

536
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,649
application that connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

537
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,570
elbow through the main health<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault site</font>

538
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:34,879
so once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> establish that link in that</font>

539
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:39,379
trust they can start pushing and pulling

540
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:41,080
information around Microsoft has fixed a

541
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:43,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we had talked to them</font>

542
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,678
however at the time how fault didn't do

543
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:48,679
much in the way of input validation and

544
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,549
there are still problems but it was

545
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:55,100
really really poorly done to start with

546
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:57,860
how faults main site was fine but they

547
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,840
have these branded portals that you can

548
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,939
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hospital that</font>

549
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">used the hell fault SDK that get linked</font>

550
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,450
to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you go to one of those</font>

551
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:10,309
sites right so you know XYZ<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital you</font>

552
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,019
log into it connect that to your main

553
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,399
health fault and then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know no</font>

554
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,480
one put validation was done on this side

555
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's written</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by someone who</font>

556
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,759
doesn't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about security and that</font>

557
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,799
would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> get transferred to you know</font>

558
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,289
your health<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul proper and which point</font>

559
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,940
the bugs would start showing up so it

560
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:29,029
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place to put in lots of</font>

561
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,399
stored cross-site scripting and you know

562
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:33,499
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that entails which basically means</font>

563
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:35,809
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to every bit of information in</font>

564
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:38,269
the vault for that particular account

565
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:40,059
and being able to stuff in malware or

566
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,249
any number of other changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the page</font>

567
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:46,070
so this brings us to we you know we

568
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:48,590
decided that that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care</font>

569
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,090
needed was another acronym so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

570
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">really like acronyms oh he likes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

571
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,689
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll give another one this leads us</font>

572
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,169
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> malicious health record or the</font>

573
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,960
mhr so various ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get these</font>

574
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:01,340
inputted into systems you know one of

575
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,529
the ways that we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

576
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,178
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at was I go create a</font>

577
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:06,860
malicious health record in my personal

578
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,169
health record my PHR was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft</font>

579
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,209
health fault I then go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I register my</font>

580
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:12,710
health fault with your hospital your

581
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,600
hospital then sucks down that record

582
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,940
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> its you know Aaron to its hl7</font>

583
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,248
network it may do bad things there it

584
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,259
then passes that record from its hl7

585
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:22,460
network into an hie which then passes it

586
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,559
to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hospitals around the</font>

587
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,950
region all from my personal helpful

588
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,450
right so you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a slew of data</font>

589
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,009
elements for whatever if you have

590
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,019
allergies to everything under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun</font>

591
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,990
and these free form template or fields

592
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:37,940
and you know shoving all your attack

593
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,470
vectors and see what comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back I'm</font>

594
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,020
allergic<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

595
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,659
thousand days that's that happens that's

596
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,658
that's that's what my allergy yeah I'm

597
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:49,220
allergic<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this but you know this isn't</font>

598
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,360
just you know kind of these problems

599
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,100
right health care in general the

600
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,500
healthcare software in general is it

601
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,120
tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fairly behind the times</font>

602
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,380
we've seen I mean we're talking like 10

603
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,879
years old bugs are rampant you know how

604
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,320
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever done like what</font>

605
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,330
you're doing like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to train on</font>

606
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,010
how to do like web application hacking

607
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,960
and you go download like web go right

608
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,908
from OAuth if you don't want to download

609
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,860
web go download open EMR it's an open

610
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:15,880
source EMR system it's just as bad but

611
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,709
it's a real app with but it's real yep

612
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,159
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sisters tested how many your</font>

613
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:26,210
cops vs homegrown how many are

614
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,070
off-the-shelf stuff versus homegrown you

615
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,640
know most of the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see in</font>

616
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:34,970
hospitals is it's what i would call both

617
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,440
right so think and a homegrown

618
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,909
application that somebody just goes out

619
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,320
and sells the hospital so it's just as

620
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,850
bad as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a homegrown application and they</font>

621
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,139
only sell it to hospitals and since

622
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,510
hospitals don't have developers they'll

623
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,370
buy it like crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right so most of</font>

624
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,289
them are off the shelf<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they kind of</font>

625
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,209
have all of the same problems and they

626
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:51,350
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> support and even the vendors</font>

627
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,940
that are selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they don't have</font>

628
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,980
the guy that wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on staff anymore</font>

629
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,360
so they can't fix things I mean you get

630
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the same problems you do with with</font>

631
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,010
homegrown applications but they're all

632
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,830
off the show up and you buy them there

633
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,840
are some real vendors too but yeah for

634
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,820
plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them they are that bad there's</font>

635
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,289
like I'll jump in right here one

636
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,110
question I thought I could go back on

637
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:14,030
was you talking about this being on the

638
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,290
action internet whether you were seeing

639
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,660
these protocols they don't

640
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:22,200
for y'all to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an assignment network</font>

641
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:26,610
oh they do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cool seeing on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

642
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay look for a very large medical</font>

643
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,110
agency and over we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into the</font>

644
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Beltway to discuss this next week so it</font>

645
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,280
oh yeah I mean yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital hospitals</font>

646
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,840
are mandated not to do that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

647
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,160
you can't send unencrypted stuff across

648
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,840
the internet you can't see a patient

649
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,180
health records are crossing it ya know

650
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,560
that mean that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day I just</font>

651
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,260
thought it was interesting because I

652
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,120
know that it was a direct protocol which

653
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,610
is would sure I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like</font>

654
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,679
you'll have things like you have

655
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,719
clearing houses right this is idea of a

656
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,550
clearing house in medical systems where

657
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,350
you send your billing stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like</font>

658
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,810
Medicare up to them and then they send

659
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,010
it they process all like the stuff with

660
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care or with the health</font>

661
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,290
insurance stuff and all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

662
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,959
you're clear house will do that's for

663
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,820
you right like so you know you're not

664
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send that data unencrypted</font>

665
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's people's health data all this kind</font>

666
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,740
of stuff I've seen clearing houses on

667
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,600
networks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

668
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,010
as a script that goes out ftp is it from

669
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,780
an ftp server sitting on the internet

670
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,129
yeah actually not right like I mean it's

671
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,570
a script<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes every day and they drop</font>

672
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,950
all these files on an ftp server on the

673
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,620
internet and that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> just flies</font>

674
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,630
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet clear text that's</font>

675
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,659
that's calling Ramona no same problem

676
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,250
yeah yeah so other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emaar which</font>

677
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,980
there are vulnerabilities published and

678
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">herb appears next to none any of the</font>

679
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,260
seven software with the primary

680
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,660
that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> taught the main problem that I</font>

681
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:47,070
see is the fact that health care in

682
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:48,929
general has<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero method for discussing</font>

683
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:53,570
vulnerabilities or reporting these right

684
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:55,799
I yes and there are some other ones but

685
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:59,340
namely the responsible disclosure isn't

686
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:02,309
there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care that's my opinion I</font>

687
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,659
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know I I personally some</font>

688
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:05,220
of the bugs that we found would have

689
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,410
trouble like just dropping those on the

690
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,000
net because they can cause you know

691
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,679
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-dose radiation machines</font>

692
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,150
to overdose patients and things like

693
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,890
that I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily want to</font>

694
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,450
be you know that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conscience</font>

695
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,679
and things but those vendors I can't

696
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to them they have no method for me</font>

697
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk to those guys and you know being</font>

698
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:23,879
that it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a small niche thing I</font>

699
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,740
don't have the luxury of things like you

700
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,760
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I defenses are those guys those</font>

701
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,470
guys don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about health care</font>

702
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,000
bugs because they can't give they don't

703
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,470
have a customer market for them so I

704
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,090
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody that I can just pass</font>

705
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,610
that off to and deal with the vendors

706
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,659
all that is up to so ends of this kind

707
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:42,120
of Sedna got a series of Malta Kano they

708
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,130
advisories are better than nothing start

709
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,510
to shame the healthcare vendors by

710
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,830
saying look your remote code execution

711
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:51,510
there's patient<font color="#CCCCCC"> harm def whatever start</font>

712
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,730
leasing these advisories can see if you

713
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,900
can motivate

714
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,060
actually I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a that's a great</font>

715
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,440
idea we actually talked about doing back

716
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,899
when it was everybody's kind of doing it

717
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,030
doing a month of healthcare bugs and we

718
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,100
talked to we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually talked some people</font>

719
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,350
over at the eff and they told us not to

720
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,840
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I don't know necessarily</font>

721
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,699
what I mean I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lawyer by any</font>

722
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,120
means but they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it might not be</font>

723
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,970
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to do yes yeah how can hold</font>

724
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,770
you it's all you buddy you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

725
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:25,650
the heat I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will funnel them</font>

726
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:27,750
through Jericho<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so uh yeah I was</font>

727
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">just you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a follow up</font>

728
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:33,120
to something other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

729
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,950
malicious health records yeah I got mad

730
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,560
alert boxes yellow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really was</font>

731
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,660
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy like you it wasn't filtering</font>

732
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,429
for anything when it came to XS s so

733
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,670
sure browsers had some protection but

734
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:47,490
you can bypass that easy enough given

735
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:50,670
the free ability to kind of put in

736
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,930
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted so some ridiculous</font>

737
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">screenshots basically just put your</font>

738
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,500
prescription as alert you know one and

739
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,270
then you go register this stuff and

740
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,810
polar boxes to come up you have a

741
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">question open yes so I know some health</font>

742
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,610
care equipment providers are moving more

743
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,160
towards like a software-as-a-service

744
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,750
solution to get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that in-house</font>

745
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,630
curious as to you know how that's

746
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,390
impacting you guys are you seeing you

747
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,460
know less issues how will the healthcare

748
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,770
land

749
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:24,260
to evolve moving forward from from your

750
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,930
perspective that's so yeah so we have

751
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,100
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a few of those applications</font>

752
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,810
things that are like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know will give</font>

753
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,610
your EMR basically you're gonna have an

754
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,020
EMR it's going to be hosted all your

755
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:36,500
data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go here things like</font>

756
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,760
that those services have all the same

757
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,790
problems that your EMR is going to have

758
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway from what we from the ones that</font>

759
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,360
I've looked at they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't segment people</font>

760
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,860
very well so your data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

761
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,060
people's data are all kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

762
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,000
Adam was talking about right there kind

763
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,649
of co-mingled very long you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they</font>

764
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,400
have all the same problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

765
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:57,590
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I part that they'll do things</font>

766
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,730
like they'll tell you you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

767
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,110
want to integrate with single sign-on

768
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,730
right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk about that later</font>

769
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,229
about how how important that is to

770
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,100
doctors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are things fast if</font>

771
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,630
you want to integrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with single</font>

772
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,129
sign-on you have to give us an Active

773
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:10,550
Directory server in our database for

774
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:12,590
your domain right yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

775
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">host one of my dcs in your in your data</font>

776
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,340
center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's right that's the kind</font>

777
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,250
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you're talking about so pretty</font>

778
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,889
standard yeah in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that area yeah so it</font>

779
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,380
kind of gets bad and then you know like

780
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,790
we were talking about sometimes problems

781
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,800
are a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more obvious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we</font>

782
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,570
were doing research for this and we were

783
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,430
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for health vault applications to</font>

784
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,139
play with we were just clicking on them

785
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,550
in the health fault directory right and

786
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,870
we come across this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was a site that</font>

787
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,940
was owned by somebody called team

788
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,879
injector they already own the site

789
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,680
before we got there they did it through

790
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,730
what we look like was probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drupal</font>

791
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,960
bug<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a PHR like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

792
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was in the health fault directory</font>

793
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,960
they were compromised what tends<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

794
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,690
happen if this happens right you know

795
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,710
did they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do breach notification for</font>

796
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,630
instance right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would have been</font>

797
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,430
trivial for an attacker to get basically

798
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,620
any record ID that came to that site

799
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,080
after they compromised it more than

800
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,280
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on the the way the app was</font>

801
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,689
architected they could have got any

802
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,690
record that had ever been in that app

803
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,410
probably just got restored without any

804
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,840
consequences we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a lot of</font>

805
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,690
breach notification and hospitals yeah

806
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,750
and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's pointing</font>

807
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,610
out with the help felt the system at the

808
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,260
time once you link an application back

809
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:30,479
to your health<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulk you need a person</font>

810
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,510
in a record i need to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know pull down</font>

811
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,340
your record and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes to it and</font>

812
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,230
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> often end up in flat files or</font>

813
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,590
sometimes in databases to but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've seen</font>

814
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,000
tons of little flat files hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

815
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,370
for those so they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

816
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,110
snatch<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font>

817
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,209
even on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that box at the time because</font>

818
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,979
typically it's not restricted by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> p</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

819
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,320
you can just from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> system at that</font>

820
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,840
point start you know updating people's

821
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,450
medical records they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just</font>

822
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,520
to quit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it corresponds to a person's</font>

823
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,110
medical record so you can then take

824
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,460
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> through you know either cross-site</font>

825
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,020
scripting or however else you got into

826
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,430
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can have access</font>

827
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,010
to anybody's medical record that it ever

828
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:12,300
attached to that system so not great

829
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:14,220
architecture so hardware talk a little

830
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,629
bit about medical hardware you guys were

831
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,250
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that this is kind of fun</font>

832
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,880
for us we have a good time with this

833
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:25,290
stuff the thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare is</font>

834
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">health care has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very large population</font>

835
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,230
of embedded devices more so than most

836
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,370
verticals right so most verticals will

837
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,110
have some of these problems that they

838
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,969
have medical devices or embedded devices

839
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,350
things like POS systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> well well</font>

840
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes have some of these issues as</font>

841
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,850
well but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare it's very</font>

842
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,189
there's very high population of these of

843
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,649
these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you have vital</font>

844
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,710
monitoring systems you have IV infusion

845
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,770
pumps that sit on on IV poles and inject

846
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,060
morphine every so often into your IV

847
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:54,800
that also connect wirelessly to a

848
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:57,090
wireless network that's probably wet

849
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,399
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often yeah I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

850
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,199
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all i can do you have drug</font>

851
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,970
dispensing cabinets that sit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

us or the two big ones we looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Omni</font>

854
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,890
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about here in a minute but</font>

855
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,540
these systems will sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> floor</font>

856
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,800
these are what the nurse goes up to you

857
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,000
once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your prescription she puts</font>

big cabinet full of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mint full of</font>

862
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:22,290
pharmaceuticals and then things like

863
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:26,190
radiology modalities things of that

864
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:27,870
nature do so modality essentially a

865
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,900
medical world by the way of just you

866
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:34,169
know typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of system for</font>

867
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,970
ya radiation of some sort so should just

868
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:39,390
be called a workstation but they like to

869
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modalities on the cell was fun uh</font>

870
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,690
it was as

871
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,880
pointed out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prescription drug cabinet</font>

872
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:47,400
that we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at there were numerous</font>

873
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,710
numerous problems with it our favorite

874
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,470
one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we featured it was actually</font>

875
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:55,530
kind of already reported because of its

876
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,870
some off-the-shelf software and we

877
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered it separately if you can see</font>

878
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,610
in that picture you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

879
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:05,370
forcefully browse to a portion of a

880
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,979
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sake of</font>

881
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:09,960
admitting it and you start editing

882
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,530
config files for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application itself</font>

883
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,840
you can put basically you know an update

884
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">exe day and that can be on an SMB share</font>

885
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,670
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fired up a share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with your</font>

886
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,040
shell on it and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that path in the</font>

887
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:25,350
file save it down and hit restart after

888
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,230
forcibly browsing to it so you can go

889
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:30,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">from zero to shell on one of these</font>

890
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,810
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick and then if you</font>

891
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,120
share out the application visually

892
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:39,860
that's running the thing you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

893
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,210
dispensing drugs which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

894
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:46,830
the name the stopper was<font color="#CCCCCC"> westwind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

895
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect this we tried to report this one</font>

896
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,420
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> AMA cell or ever I'd on sat on this</font>

897
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,889
about a year and a half we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

898
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reported in westwood web</font>

899
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect and just trying to contact on me</font>

900
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:58,350
so before we talked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con on this I</font>

901
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we had this for probably about a</font>

902
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:02,790
year and a half and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

903
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,230
it's sort of a key example of the kinds

904
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we run into this one's not</font>

905
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,350
going to kill anyone it's probably

906
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,680
unless they just you know oh do you not

907
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,900
really loaded yeah but but we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

908
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,250
stuff all the time so yeah that's that's

909
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:19,470
what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go go to that website</font>

910
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:21,450
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know point exe update that file you</font>

911
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,040
can have shell so from there I mean you

912
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">get gooey access the application you can</font>

913
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,600
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things there it's also that</font>

914
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,900
application running in memory it's just

915
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,240
a basic bitmap and memory that when you

916
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,880
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just basically set what drawer and</font>

917
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,589
what cabinet like what row and what what

918
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,260
drawer you want to pop open call a

919
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,700
function you know you can inject code

920
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,590
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python or something into that</font>

921
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,220
process call that function it spits out

922
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:49,320
drugs so pretty amusing we thought and a

923
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,730
good bug to share kind of you know talk

924
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,820
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this um so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

925
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,220
yeah so inevitably when we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

926
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff and Michael Eddington kind of</font>

927
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,339
coined this phrase when we were at

928
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">DEFCON a couple years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago about death</font>

929
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,670
packets and he says you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

930
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,130
death packets with peach i love it i

931
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the death packets the thing</font>

932
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,520
about about these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> called death</font>

933
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,790
packets right so somebody asks can you

934
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,770
really kill somebody with a packet the

935
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:19,640
answer as far as we saw it was yet

936
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,840
probably absolutely the thing is they

937
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,210
you already know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these things</font>

938
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">right these systems are the thing about</font>

939
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">health care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems rightness and we</font>

940
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,339
kind of talked about it earlier about

941
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">how government regulations will tend to</font>

942
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,530
hinder one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those is FDA certification</font>

943
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,660
so if i make a health care product

944
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,250
healthcare piece of hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I have</font>

945
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take this and get this certified by</font>

946
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,730
the Food and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Drug Administration very</font>

947
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:43,100
expensive process to go through when

948
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,790
they certify it they say okay you're

949
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:50,420
certified you cannot change<font color="#E5E5E5"> this system</font>

950
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:51,620
right so now the FDA if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

951
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,030
look on their site you dig on it they'll

952
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,339
see you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see there where you can do</font>

953
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,630
things like install security patches you

954
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,860
can't change like can't upgrade with

955
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,960
service pack for change eos which you

956
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,310
can install security packages vendors on

957
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,230
the other hand will tell you you cannot

958
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:05,779
patch these things right you cannot

959
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:08,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">change them at all so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

960
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,680
proton accelerator and this this was

961
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,720
actually conversation i had with the

962
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,549
company a proton accelerator that

963
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">injects high-dose radiation into cancer</font>

964
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,910
patients<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and they told me I</font>

965
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,200
couldn't scan this box for

966
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,000
vulnerabilities I couldn't run our bone

967
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,000
scanners on it I couldn't patch it

968
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,190
because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that system goes down it</font>

969
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,270
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote Chernobyl someone I</font>

970
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">swear to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> God there was ongoing</font>

971
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,470
litigation at the time I I look at the

972
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,060
third at the system this system that

973
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:41,060
does this was windows XP service pack

974
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:43,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero with no patches sitting live on the</font>

975
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,570
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like okay I won't shut it</font>

976
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,210
down but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourteen-year-old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kid from</font>

977
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,830
China that's already on it might and

978
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,930
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

979
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,520
problem they have right they you get all

980
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,509
these systems that come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> from medical</font>

981
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,610
vendors and they tell you you can't

982
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,750
patch any of these right you can't patch

983
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,750
any of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems and they're all</font>

984
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,430
ancient versions of windows that are

985
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,190
bedded in these devices that sit there

986
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:05,140
and run I've seen you know kiosk systems

987
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,370
that have come in that where we walk you

988
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,799
walk into a hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you find a</font>

989
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,150
doctor right and they're these big

990
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,110
kiosks that are in hospitals and you

991
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,750
plug them in and they've already got

992
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,800
malware on them I mean as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as you</font>

993
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,540
plug them in its connecting out to a

994
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:23,620
botnet in China certified pre-owned so

995
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:25,420
skull back thanks so you know so you

996
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,730
know these systems were very fragile

997
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if you're doing scans and stuff</font>

998
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this you could do resource</font>

999
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,130
exhausting very easy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if these</font>

1000
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,780
systems go down you they don't fail open

1001
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,130
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have they could come up in a</font>

1002
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,110
state that's halfway monitored or

1003
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,320
unmonitored and could be detrimental to

1004

patient health you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know hvac systems</font>

00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,990
that are usually on hospital networks

1006
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,280
you'll go in you'll do look at a

1007
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,439
hospital you'll scan it you'll find a

1008
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,790
system running PHP and you connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

1009
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,810
and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any authen it</font>

1010
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,120
controls the heating and air in the

1011
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,220
entire hospital yeah and that I

1012
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,890
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> deadly to people who are sick</font>

1013
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,359
or elderly when the temperature starts

1014
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,279
changing in a hospital I've seen it

1015
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,930
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just start evacuating they</font>

1016
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,550
take all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patients and they</font>

1017
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">give them to a different Hospital like</font>

1018
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,010
quick because they don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how long</font>

1019
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,190
it's going to take to put back together

1020
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,660
and yeah yeah so you know there are all

1021
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,910
these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are obviously you know</font>

1022
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,460
simple and things like that there's also

1023
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,200
you know the fancy targeted attacks you

1024
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,940
know we've heard of heard of issues

1025
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,460
we're like you know infusion pumps you

1026
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,630
can you can make them you know maybe

1027
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,250
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and down or something like that</font>

1028
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,890
it'll ject air bubbles into an IV line

1029
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,890
from a network things like that so there

1030
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,810
are those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well like we said</font>

1031
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,370
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the disclosing things you know I</font>

1032
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,960
have loved<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones in a hospital you guys</font>

1033
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,240
may end up in a hospital sometime I

1034
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,830
don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bugs I</font>

1035
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,540
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know say</font>

1036
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,830
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet here's how you kill someone</font>

1037
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,390
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact is though</font>

1038
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,890
probably people already know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1039
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine right i mean if i can</font>

1040
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,629
find this stuff I'm I'm you know not

1041
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:53,500
anything real special if I can find<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1042
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:55,750
stuff somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else can't do so so</font>

1043
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,760
that's bad but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now what who wants to go</font>

1044
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,269
to the doctor they<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the</font>

1045
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto pounds anyone</font>

1046
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:06,198
nothing kills me oh right so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1047
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:08,839
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about miscellaneous pen tets</font>

1048
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,249
notes again yeah we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> went over you</font>

1049
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,399
know embedded devices that these<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

1050
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:16,279
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are they tend to just walk</font>

1051
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:18,529
up crash have problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with routine</font>

1052
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:20,959
things from a vulnerability assessment

1053
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:22,899
standpoint like port scans sometimes

1054
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:25,189
you'll just kill one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these systems</font>

1055
00:40:22,899 --> 00:40:28,098
and they can directly affect patient

1056
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:30,469
care so if you're testing hospitals be

1057
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:32,899
exceedingly careful ask them for the

1058
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:34,759
ranges of all the stuff that they have

1059
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:36,469
these networks used to be air-gapped and

1060
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,729
they're not anymore yeah they're having

1061
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:38,869
to get this data to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font>

1062
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,968
people through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Chinese and things like</font>

1063
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:44,029
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> those air-gapped biomed networks</font>

1064
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:47,269
are no longer air gaps in hospitals yep

1065
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:48,949
definitely other fun things doctors are

1066
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:51,348
very very serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the time it</font>

1067
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:53,509
takes to log into anything they'll sit

1068
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:55,369
there with<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop watches and basically</font>

1069
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:59,329
record how long it takes to get from

1070
00:40:55,369 --> 00:41:01,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">login to app because every second counts</font>

1071
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:02,929
to them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it see more patients</font>

1072
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,819
right we had a doctor that literally

1073
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:06,889
would sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a stopwatch and</font>

1074
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:09,199
tell me it was two seconds slower today

1075
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:10,999
than it was yesterday and that's wasting

1076
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,019
his time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to fix this and I</font>

1077
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:13,549
said well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you waste</font>

1078
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:16,519
timing it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to me about</font>

1079
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:19,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and I don't think he thought that was</font>

1080
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,169
that funny but yeah they're kind of like

1081
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:22,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right i mean these are the types of</font>

1082
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:24,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that you have going on in these</font>

1083
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:26,779
hospitals doctors are run hospitals

1084
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,929
they're these very highly specialized

1085
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:32,869
poorly implemented SSO solutions that

1086
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:34,880
you'll see pop up in hospitals to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

1087
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,429
to skirt this but they often just make

1088
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,529
it exceedingly easy to to log into the

1089
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:43,880
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're really</font>

1090
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:46,209
poorly made most the time also<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you</font>

1091
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,009
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> their common common remote access</font>

1092
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:52,519
technologies that most of these

1093
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:55,309
organizations use so<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank Citrix and</font>

1094
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:56,689
anything else of that nature because

1095
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:58,399
I've got all these win32 apps that

1096
00:41:56,689 --> 00:42:00,649
people really need to have access to

1097
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:02,549
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only run on you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know certain old</font>

1098
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:05,609
systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> serves</font>

1099
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:08,130
durations yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows NT or you</font>

1100
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,900
know unpatched XP boxes with one

1101
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:13,020
incredibly old outdated version of Java

1102
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,370
on it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cetera and so forth and they</font>

1103
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">were paying to keep up so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

1104
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,680
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of stuff and yeah we were</font>

1105
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:21,360
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about FDA approval so you</font>

1106
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,549
basically get to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the old</font>

1107
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite bugs and promote exploits come</font>

1108
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,590
back from the past whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do one</font>

1109
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:33,359
of these tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Circuit 2005</font>

1110
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:34,980
yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fake so also wireless is going</font>

1111
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,840
to be everywhere for wireless handheld

1112
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,180
stuff it's usually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the least</font>

1113
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,980
common denominator for wireless security

1114
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,960
most of these old handhelds and things

1115
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,580
like that this people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get our ancient</font>

1116
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,650
ancient<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux kernels on them that can't</font>

1117
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,690
handle certain things so at best you may

1118
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,970
see leap more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than likely you're going</font>

1119
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,650
to see WEP or wide open there's

1120
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:56,430
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be any certain</font>

1121
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,900
freeradius WP all day long yeah you can

1122
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,580
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are public places right</font>

1123
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,160
hospitals are public places you can walk

1124
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,990
around with antennas hanging off your

1125
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,540
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody really looks at you too</font>

1126
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,580
funny you know I we walked around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1127
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,290
hospital with a marine battery powering

1128
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,640
a lap top of it and every was like hey

1129
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:15,360
look at the weird guy and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kept</font>

1130
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,190
talking um you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find</font>

1131
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,140
unlocked computers everywhere unlocked

1132
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,670
ports you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go book public meeting</font>

1133
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,339
rooms for an event and just come and

1134
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,350
hack the host hospital that day so I

1135
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:28,260
kind of alluded to this earlier with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1136
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:29,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">dicom right so everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has these dicom</font>

1137
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,560
viewers and doctors have to view these

1138
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,290
when patients come in so what happens is

1139
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I go get a CT they give me a CD the CD</font>

1140
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:39,000
has my images and it has an exe on it

1141
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,520
that's the dicom viewer that exe has to

1142
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,980
be installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the computer with admin</font>

1143
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,440
privileges to work this is common for

1144
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,520
doctors to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDs from patients put</font>

1145
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,920
them into the computer run that

1146
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,240
application view that image right I take

1147
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,980
that CD home<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor it with some</font>

1148
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,629
interpreter stuff take it to you you put

1149
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,120
it in congratulations you got a shell<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1150
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,290
a network it's that easy like that's the

1151
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,029
kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean social engineering</font>

1152
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:02,509
and things like that it's a playground

1153
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,510
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care</font>

1154
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,570
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some things up you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1155
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:11,180
health care is exceedingly exceedingly

1156
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:13,250
difficult to secure mostly due to its

1157
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,410
public nature and just being about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

1158
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,280
years if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not more behind the time when</font>

1159
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:21,020
it comes to all the stuff they provide

1160
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,610
it's not obviously just<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care that</font>

1161
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:26,600
has these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems particularly with the</font>

1162
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:28,580
embedded stuff you know any industry

1163
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,319
that has to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of that kind</font>

1164
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,150
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware is going to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

1165
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,670
problems health care<font color="#E5E5E5"> just has a high</font>

1166
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,290
population of these critical embedded

1167
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:39,710
systems that directly impact people's

1168
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:42,440
lives in a way that is is just personal

1169
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,820
on a different level and so I think

1170
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one of the reasons why it's very</font>

1171
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,250
important both there we said they're

1172
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,340
both you know physically accessible in

1173
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:54,320
public but virtually<font color="#E5E5E5"> too they try to be</font>

1174
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,660
very hospitable and provide lots of

1175
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,640
services over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net these days all</font>

1176
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,040
kinds of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ways that people can</font>

1177
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,080
get involved with local health

1178
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,580
organizations and you know stay fit and

1179
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,990
that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1180
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,450
community outreach<font color="#E5E5E5"> which means a lot of</font>

1181
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,069
web apps and a lot of a lot of

1182
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:11,390
interesting portals and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that sort of</font>

1183
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,750
thing just hanging out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

1184
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:16,730
and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else going wrong you</font>

1185
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,260
can get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that they don't</font>

1186
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:20,960
typically do the best segmentation

1187
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,850
internally as well so more often<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1188
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,680
not you're saying public servers that

1189
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:28,400
are you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of the rest</font>

1190
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:31,759
of the server blocks so that's a real

1191
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,000
problem and yeah the whole thing about

1192
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,870
regulation the adoption of<font color="#CCCCCC"> EMR S&H IES</font>

1193
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,270
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maturity is kind of</font>

1194
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:43,040
a huge issue and it's pushing people in

1195
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:46,070
a really dangerous direction without

1196
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,420
having a chance for for the vendors to

1197
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,090
catch up and you know figure out this

1198
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,680
whole security<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff as well as the FDA</font>

1199
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:57,290
certification devices that we talked

1200
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">about earlier so kind of you know we</font>

1201
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,009
talked about Arthur you know how can we

1202
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,750
fix these problems right I mean this is

1203
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,980
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least try to put</font>

1204
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,390
something out there right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean a lot</font>

1205
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these are really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our problems to kind</font>

1206
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:11,259
of fix namely because honestly doctors

1207
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:13,069
are doctors and doctors run hospitals

1208
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,930
administration's don't run hospitals

1209
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,600
right the hospital administrators don't

1210
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,680
run the hospital

1211
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,710
the doctors that work they run the

1212
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,540
hospital I can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have a security</font>

1213
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution and I can say hey this is going</font>

1214
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to fix ninety percent of our stuff I'm</font>

1215
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,310
going to put it in and all this kind of

1216
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,020
stuff is good and then a doctor says no

1217
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,759
and the administration comes back to me

1218
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> says but he's a transplant doc and</font>

1219
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,340
he brings millions here and sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1220
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:37,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health care think</font>

1221
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 years ago right i mean like 10 years</font>

1222
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago what were our security problems</font>

1223
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,200
right ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago people were</font>

1224
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,730
struggling still with okay we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1225
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,930
password expiration and password

1226
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,390
complexity and things like that right

1227
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what hospitals do today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1228
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go to a hospital they're not gonna</font>

1229
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">have password complexity they're not</font>

1230
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,530
have password expiration they're

1231
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely not a two-factor all right</font>

1232
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,710
permissions things like that those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1233
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that hospitals are still</font>

1234
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:05,010
having to to battle today so patients we

1235
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,890
think patients shouldn't volunteer their

1236
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:09,570
data and opt-in services so helpful

1237
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,850
seriously you probably don't need it

1238
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,710
yeah anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that nature it's</font>

1239
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,970
considering how bad these things are at

1240
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:17,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point there's no reason that</font>

1241
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,779
consumers<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that level should trust</font>

1242
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,520
anyone with this information which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1243
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,340
you know questionable<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway to begin</font>

1244
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,560
with but having seen it it's a it's

1245
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,850
truly questionable we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare</font>

1246
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,170
professionals should should leverage

1247
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,220
some of their buying power right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1248
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,930
the ones they're spending money on this

1249
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,669
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop accepting from a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare</font>

1250
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:35,279
vendor that it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not patch their</font>

1251
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,650
windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> XP service pack zero box that's</font>

1252
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,950
not okay I say I'm we're not gonna buy

1253
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:43,890
them hospitals have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> force the</font>

1254
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:45,120
purchase of IT things through IT they

1255
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">often don't do that right there often</font>

1256
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,660
separate groups inside this hospital

1257
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,770
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have a cardiology group</font>

1258
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,180
and things like that that will go and

1259
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,590
buy technology systems that need to be

1260
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,029
on the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new be on the</font>

1261
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,250
network and then won't tell anybody

1262
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,570
there by them right and then one<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

1263
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,650
you'll randomly you know your IT

1264
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,820
department we sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll</font>

1265
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,410
get a call and say hey we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

1266
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,330
this on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network what is it what does</font>

1267
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">it do as add a risk assessment no we</font>

1268
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:08,130
just bought it from our vendor we need

1269
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:10,200
it for you know fixing hearts right and

1270
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,330
so doctors in general a lot of the times

1271
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,359
to we've seen or at least that I noticed

1272
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,799
you know they have obviously we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1273
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,690
agree doctors have a very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs</font>

1274
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys save lives is awesome they tend to</font>

1275
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">use that to force you into doing things</font>

1276
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,270
that that then it isn't as important as

1277
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,470
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be right you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

1278
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:28,080
this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network or somebody's going</font>

1279
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:31,919
to die today no they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that's not</font>

1280
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:35,400
happen there are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulations</font>

1281
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,140
that hospitals have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to abide by that say</font>

1282
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,340
basically if their technology goes down

1283
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,868
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to still be able to provide</font>

1284
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,100
patient care and take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of patients</font>

1285
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the whole purpose behind those</font>

1286
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:46,560
regulations and so you know that there

1287
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,910
nobody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to diaphus is there</font>

1288
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,119
nobody supposed to die of a system goes

1289
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:52,379
down it's that true you know there's

1290
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,680
there's things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be say to you the way</font>

1291
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,150
of that air gap networks you know go

1292
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,310
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the segment segment segment</font>

1293
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,600
segment if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't make something</font>

1294
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,310
compliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment it off your network</font>

1295
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:06,270
tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> only what can get to it that's</font>

1296
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:08,430
about the best you can do again people

1297
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:12,450
should should do best practices right so

1298
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:14,580
for instance a lot of technology and

1299
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">health care a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it comes tends to</font>

1300
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:19,230
kind of really boil down to file

1301
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:21,180
transfer right they're transferring flat

1302
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,650
files between one system or another stop

1303
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,310
getting like proprietary stuff that's

1304
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:27,900
not securable when you can just do SSH

1305
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:29,520
you know things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then</font>

1306
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,730
healthcare manufacturers make it easier

1307
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to report bugs although or you know</font>

1308
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,670
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to Jericho</font>

1309
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and charcoal do it so right right give</font>

1310
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:40,710
me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slash security or something because</font>

1311
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:42,570
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly possible to record</font>

1312
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,180
of anyone at those places and when you

1313
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:47,609
do it's usually hostile another<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom</font>

1314
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">hat i needi deposition is human</font>

1315
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">categorize medical under</font>

1316
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:58,500
data know if you push for that and you

1317
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,230
get metal classified as it then our

1318
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,970
government under ics-cert<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then take</font>

1319
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,069
all of your vulnerability reports and

1320
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,629
even for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I agree yeah and in right</font>

1321
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:08,339
now skate uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthier is that were</font>

1322
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,559
under skid that's a great idea actually

1323
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,420
like yeah that's that's that's another

1324
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,410
thing right like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked in I said</font>

1325
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,450
I've worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care for seven</font>

1326
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,649
years i never saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single thing that</font>

1327
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:19,859
mention skating anywhere on a healthcare

1328
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:22,980
network ever fun isn't one advisory cool

1329
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:27,828
under some kind of medical devices see

1330
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:30,960
how they handle yeah be good idea yeah

1331
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:32,640
yeah that'd be awesome I think that's

1332
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,500
like I said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1333
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,020
I think there needs to be something that

1334
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,480
has to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because the fact is</font>

1335
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,950
it's not getting any better they're

1387
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,820
vehicles and it's just an IP network on

1388
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,320
that range but yes throughout the whole

1389
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,270
city there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always wanted to get on</font>

00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">it cuz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm like hey free Wi-Fi ton</font>

1391
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:56,630
of stuff there's also a 1.7 bandagi to

1392
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:58,250
for medical devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are a</font>

1393
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,960
number of like environmental<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring</font>

1394
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,760
systems that are used frequently on

1395
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:05,030
those and some other really interesting

1396
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,650
stuff so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's worth checking out</font>

1397
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,359
absolutely and some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks pretty</font>

1398
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">horrid from just the brief glances i've</font>

1399
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:14,330
had over some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the documents to get</font>

1400
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:17,180
real quick i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind carry out on both</font>

1401
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,950
things on that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is federal government</font>

1402
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's they're running in the same</font>

1403
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:23,118
problems I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean as in the regular</font>

1404
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,210
commercial health care we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting</font>

1405
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:29,390
the issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately people above us</font>

1406
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:32,450
are also fighting us back Yahoo raining

1407
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:34,069
so we are we are voicing this out and

1408
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:36,649
you mentioned the status system we

1409
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:38,270
brought that up numerous times and we've

1410
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,430
been beat down on that too because we're

1411
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:42,230
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the same problems where</font>

1412
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:44,450
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more regulations on us</font>

1413
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:46,940
compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like regular health care</font>

1414
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">turn out the wireless thing gets there</font>

1415
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,740
is definitely central managers we pick

1416
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,460
up all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we have a spectrum</font>

1417
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,069
analyzer

1418
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:57,290
you see we monitor tech though we always

1419
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to joke that when new people come</font>

1420
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,500
into healthcare we would set a calendar

1421
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,000

ones that I've done right so I've done

1434
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,230
massive health care systems that are

1435
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:35,359
nationwide health care systems that have

1436
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:39,770
hospitals in most states I've done on

1437
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:42,619

1439
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:47,630
care systems for<font color="#CCCCCC"> States all the way down</font>

1440
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:50,450

things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right there any sway in</font>

1444
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:59,900
either direction as to which ones are in

1445
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">a worse state um the biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difference</font>

1446
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I saw was the smaller ones tend to use</font>

1447
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,310
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud based things but tend to be</font>

1448
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:12,349
worse on on basic stuff right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1449
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,759
their basic networks tend to be worse

1450
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:15,380
because they don't have dedicated

1451
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,270
security people some<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably don't have</font>

1452
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,040
dedicated networks yeah they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1453
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,869
dedicated I tivo right so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1456
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,799
right like passwords or you know like my

1457

1458
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,820
expires and all that kind of stuff but

1459
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,080
for their medical<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff they tend to all</font>

1460
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,130
use like cloud service based stuff

1461
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,089
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can't afford any of it</font>
