1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,980
for the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want to say</font>

2
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,990
is I want necessarily a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PHP expert but</font>

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,550
I'm a I'm a security person that is

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,419
trying to learn it as much as I can

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,250
about PHP for for two reasons that I'm

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,490
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about as we go into the</font>

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,059
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did want to give up just</font>

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">a few points about me so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apt</font>

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,328
are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter this is where I live i</font>

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,730
started my security career probably

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,200
about a decade ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was doing cool</font>

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,419
ass doing web stack I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,870
thing is at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I don't even think</font>

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,410
sequel in the injection was invented yet

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,959
so but was doing cool stuff but for

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,440
various career reasons i went from doing

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,159
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to do move on started giving</font>

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,158
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this which went into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that which</font>

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,030
really you know let into this was even

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">worse i created</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tons of this but guess</font>

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,100
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all this cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff was going</font>

22
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,970
on you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was creating this I'm</font>

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,250
like what how am i doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:28,350
to do this so you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of it I</font>

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,630
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> prob about a year and a half ago</font>

26
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,429
now i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a position where i'm doing</font>

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,339
trade study type stuff so it's really

28
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,280
not you not super technical and so on

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,140
but at least I'm getting to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,310
lot of these security products that are

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,880
out there so create some of this I drink

32
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">good versions of this now I spend my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,229
time trying to learn some of the hands

34
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,780
on it stuff which I try to showcase on

35
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,759
my website<font color="#E5E5E5"> which now we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did a</font>

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,259
name change so so I'm a little bit more

37
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,729
happier and i think that's it alright so

38
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,860
for those that can't be that business

39
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,690
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to give</font>

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,729
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> overview of what i will tell you over</font>

41
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:14,270
and over again during the entire

42
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,790
presentation so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my version of</font>

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the overview so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to first just</font>

44
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,840
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little bit of history of PHP</font>

45
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,760
security then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into</font>

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,190
detecting a tax and how it at least the

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,000
strategy that I've taken on my website

48
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,310
and then get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to handle PHP in</font>

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,370
your environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key thing there</font>

50
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,360
is it's in your environment I've sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:45,170
a while ago started drinking the risk

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,930
management kool-aid and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it</font>

53
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:51,049
the types of things that are the types

54
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,470
of controls that you implement or more

55
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,660
days on the threats in the

56
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,430
vulnerabilities that your particular

57
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,150
environment has and then we'll just

58
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">close with some general thoughts so so</font>

59
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:10,160
PHP overview so PHP was created by rocks

60
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,950
must alert off<font color="#CCCCCC"> 19 1995 excellent answer</font>

61
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for personal homepage now I</font>

62
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know about you but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sound too secure so the background just</font>

64
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit about PHP that it don't</font>

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,100
know is it's a general-purpose

66
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:28,670
server-side scripting language obviously

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,150
used a lot at least in initially in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

68
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,970
web develop in all wena to trade dynamic

69
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,489
websites there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people that I</font>

70
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,130
know now that use it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do a</font>

71
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:43,459
lot of their scripting and stuff is just

72
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,790
for back in for purposes too so the

73
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:50,570
language has grown some<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's interpreted</font>

74
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's free open source so that's good now</font>

75
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:57,230
they came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a better name for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

76
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,290
da chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> or its HP / tux prequel or</font>

77
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:03,859
food processor and it's run by the PHP

78
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,390
group so it's come a long way so the

79
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,100
reason why I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn as much</font>

80
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,989
about this as i could is

81
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,260
I run this website and I wanted you to

82
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what in the website is based on PHP</font>

83
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,279
and I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what I could do to</font>

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,590
protect the website from getting hacked

85
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,529
the other reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

86
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,419
hand side of the slide there is the fur

87
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,200
the past I'd say three four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years I've</font>

88
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,820
been going around in this security

89
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,130
community and we're in this echo chamber

90
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,900
and you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all saying yeah we</font>

91
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,810
should do these things and it's like

92
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,000
yeah right on man you know but so what i

93
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,980
want to do what I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is learn</font>

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,100
something that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could then use that</font>

95
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,190
knowledge and reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and she can</font>

96
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,840
contribute back to the developers in

97
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:54,800
this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> within the key in the PHP</font>

98
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:58,580
application development environment so

99
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,670
history history I mean HP it started off

100
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,150
from you be bad and I think up to this

101
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:10,190
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's fairly secure if you use</font>

102
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:12,890
it right but there's this a buddy but

103
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:17,270
has a people still think of it in terms

104
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:20,390
of its<font color="#E5E5E5"> its history and the problems that</font>

105
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,990
it's had in<font color="#CCCCCC"> d possibly not even the day</font>

106
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:27,289
they had read that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were insecure</font>

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:32,180
default configurations as they example

108
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:35,840
register global it wasn't disabled by

109
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,790
default it doesn't force type definition

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,210
so that's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,700
like define them and whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> their what</font>

112
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,940
type of values are going to be that

113
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,700
variable but you know it on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

114
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,140
they don't necessarily have to be

115
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,570
initialized to so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that made it easy on</font>

116
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,710
the programmer but it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from</font>

117
00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:00,680
a security perspective it it you know it

118
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:04,520
didn't too well there and then also it

119
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,680
has if it's it has a very easy initial

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,270
learning curve and so that means anybody

121
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,280
you know some kid<font color="#CCCCCC"> in high school that</font>

122
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,030
really hasn't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,349
have a good understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe fro</font>

124
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,869
programming theory so they could come in

125
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,389
and just pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up tha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know start</font>

126
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,360
throwing web apps out there with and

127
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:27,590
they're creating these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> without a</font>

128
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,050
formal understanding of you know coding

129
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,469
in a quality way they built<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of</font>

130
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,990
that you also have the security issues

131
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:39,410
and it's also widely deployed so

132
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,930
obviously it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good target sort of the</font>

133
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:47,750
same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Microsoft has had over</font>

134
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,940
at least had back in the day so to the

135
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,970
next two sections are some best

136
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,400
practices that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came across in these</font>

137
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,280
are and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't</font>

138
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,349
think they're there they're best I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

139
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,440
these are things in shawls be doing and

140
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,950
so I just call them standard practices

141
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:11,000
so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is this 25 PHP security</font>

142
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:14,390
best practices in in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,240
initial research I reach out to some

144
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,669
vanilla hackers community and several

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,430
folks there we have several local

146
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:25,700
package outer spaces such as are they

147
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,640
allocated<font color="#CCCCCC"> novalogic reverse space so I</font>

148
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,380
reached out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as a as a starting</font>

149
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,260
point of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I could find</font>

150
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,080
some good practices for what we should

151
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,690
be doing and so he gave is huge so so

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,330
they've recommended this particular art

153
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,700
article and it's huge list of 25 things

154
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you should do and it isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just eh</font>

155
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,430
piece is specific but it's also like it

156
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,800
deals with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> cope with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole with</font>

157
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,740
the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> sack you mean so you're dealing</font>

158
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,010
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the OS stuff PHP and then the</font>

159
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:01,039
apps are run on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that in and then</font>

160
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,440
even out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's you know one of</font>

161
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,300
the big things now is monitoring which

162
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,840
is or 24 odd addresses so and then as a

163
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:15,020
bonus he he sort of throws in two tools

164
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,219
there's PHP I 80s which which I have a

165
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,948
section about

166
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">later and there's HP set info which I</font>

167
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:28,729
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next slide so I</font>

168
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:31,789
guess number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 here is this other good</font>

169
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:34,679
soup<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hassan I'm probably totally</font>

170
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:39,689
screwing up the pronunciation but they

171
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:45,050
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this advanced protection system 4</font>

172
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:49,079
p-8 PHP so what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it has to mod</font>

173
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:52,140
modules the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a is a patch to</font>

174
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:54,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PhD for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that soft some basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

175
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,870
or helps mitigate some basic things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

176
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,760
buffer overflows and for format string

177
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,190
vulnerabilities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's a</font>

178
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,550
second module that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have to add</font>

179
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,110
on as an extension and it has a

180
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,349
approximately 50 features but it takes

181
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,230
care of some of the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like</font>

182
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">runtime and some protection as well as</font>

183
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">filtering and different logging features</font>

184
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:24,050
the next thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the HP sec info</font>

185
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:27,720
so who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Catesby info does</font>

186
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:31,769
nobody one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so what PHP</font>

187
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,899
info does is blow that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's HP file and</font>

188
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:37,079
you look that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on your web server and</font>

189
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:39,300
and then navigate to it and then if you

190
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:43,019
don't it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like if you're using</font>

191
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,719
a shared hosting provider it'll so what

192
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,959
this page will display is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all your</font>

193
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,260
kin what all your PHP configurations are

194
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,949
so this basically does the same thing

195
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:58,380
except instead of looking at all the

196
00:09:55,949 --> 00:10:00,689
different configuration parameters it

197
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,360
only looks at the ones that are security

198
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,579
relevant and it actually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> built in</font>

199
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,230
saying all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as you can see</font>

200
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,750
there there's part about 30 things that

201
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,990
it looks out and so it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in and</font>

202
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,329
say oh like it will give a

203
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,579
recommendation of what that setting

204
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,510
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and then it gives you as you</font>

205
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:21,810
can see here

206
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:25,260
a green if you're doing good or yellow

207
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:28,709
or warning and they also have a red for

208
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,080
you you need to really change this so

209
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,080
that's a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way of going in and</font>

210
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,720
getting a feel for from a configuration

211
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,100
perspective how lock down your

212
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,490
environment is as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that are</font>

213
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with having PHP security stuff</font>

214
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,840
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it deals with some of the sudden like</font>

215
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,110
common things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we always hear all</font>

216
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:54,930
about such as magic quotes register

217
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:58,680
globals<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a group and user I gate um</font>

218
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,349
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next standard practice that that</font>

219
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,949
I found that I found very useful was the

220
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Loas PHP top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five and instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of just</font>

221
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:10,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">having this long list of 25</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eggs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

222
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,170
know what the configuration should be

223
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,990
they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote it broke it down by</font>

224
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,459
other tack type so you have remote code

225
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,520
execution and cross site scripting

226
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,450
sequel induction general configuration

227
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,699
things and then also file system of

228
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:30,030
attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice thing about this is</font>

229
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,830
they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> break it out into these</font>

230
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:36,810
are in order to stop attacks which they

231
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,120
cross site scripting these are the

232
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:42,420
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer needs to do</font>

233
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,730
and then they also set back and say oh

234
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,579
well for the cyst admin that's one of

235
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:51,330
your hoes this is what they should do

236
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:54,330
too so that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice reference so</font>

237
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:58,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next section I wanted it in this is</font>

238
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:00,660
about detecting attacks against your

239
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,720
site so there's a lot of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

240
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,150
could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through my web logs look at my</font>

241
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,760
PHP logs and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you</font>

242
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,970
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm lazy so i just wanted something</font>

243
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,390
that would tell me what's going on so

244
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:18,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the definition of what the</font>

245
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:22,050
author so it's a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> late layer for</font>

246
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,000
your PHP they<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweat up for every attack</font>

247
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,500
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,320
numerical impact rating based on what

249
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,270
that number is you can program in what

250
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,330
type of action you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to take so</font>

251
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:39,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can either say oh I just want it to</font>

252
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:42,470
log<font color="#E5E5E5"> email you a warning message or or</font>

253
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,050
maybe end that process now the last part

254
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,570
is it is is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what caught my</font>

255
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,370
attention knowing that that I was lazy

256
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,610
and I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to troll through my</font>

257
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:56,690
blog so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it enables you to see who's</font>

258
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,930
attacking grip site<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and or with</font>

259
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:05,200
without tedious trawling of log files so

260
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:08,329
as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on you I was in so</font>

261
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,690
just some detection mechanisms that it

262
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:15,950
uses so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is a have some</font>

263
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:18,260
anti evasion norm normalization

264
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,800
capabilities and into that are written

265
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">into as converter PHP file and they also</font>

266
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:28,490
and part of it is signature pace so they

267
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,980
in the particular product for that is

268
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,320
default filter and they also have a

269
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:37,760
mathematical function which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> center</font>

270
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,130
huge and so it does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the as it says</font>

271
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,750
there it will look at any strings that

272
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,350
are being passed in that are greater

273
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:48,110
than 25 characters it does a ratio of

274
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:51,710
you know the word characters clover lawn

275
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">where characters and then the lower that</font>

276
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,990
ratio is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the greater the probability of</font>

277
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,449
attack now I don't understand all the

278
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">paths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the guy that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with this</font>

279
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,060
problem road like a thesis so I don't

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,120
understand it but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of going</font>

281
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:12,109
with what what he has there so the

282
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,560
normal ratio is about 7.5 and they found

283
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,480
that usually if it's below a 3.5 that's

284
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,000
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a that's where you start</font>

285
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,310
having a higher probability<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it being</font>

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top so with any IDs system you</font>

287
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,099
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

288
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,839
you're going to get tons of false pause

289
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,730
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just one example where you I</font>

290
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,940
like I've loaded this thing up and I was

291
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,450
in just millions of attack attack attack

292
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,920
attack it turned out it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was because of</font>

293
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:46,100
theirs false positives or google

294
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:50,870
analytics cookies so and as you can see

295
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:53,690
there that underscore UTM MD is where

296
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,600
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> derive that from in so you you</font>

297
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,149
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to change the configuration</font>

298
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,980
file that I circle there and if you look

299
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,339
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the bottom there's an</font>

300
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,149
exception line that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you throw in and so</font>

301
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:10,580
you just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as with any IDs this</font>

302
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:13,640
system you have to tune it and this is

303
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,700
the way they do it their signature up

304
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,920
aids are pretty simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just the two</font>

305
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,170
files the converter and the default

306
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,260
filter file you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff it up you just</font>

307
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,719
go get the new ones and over over right

308
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,410
those they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it converter file</font>

309
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,630
isn't updated too often and I'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

310
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,270
default filter what they try to do is

311
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,420
when is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when for the signatures they</font>

312
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,490
they try to write them very generically

313
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,310
so you don't have to update them that

314
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,230
off and but I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of worried because</font>

315
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,380
I usually don't see updates with that

316
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,980
you know you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually between 30 to</font>

317
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,570
60 days so I do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of worried but and</font>

318
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,589
then also whenever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade</font>

319
00:15:53,570 --> 00:16:01,459
the page<font color="#E5E5E5"> P IDs software if it's pretty</font>

320
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:05,839
easy I'll just unzip like I'll have HP

321
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:08,660
is 0.7 so in that same directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

322
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:13,339
just do like the point 8 version and

323
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:16,400
then I change the PHP or the PHP IPS or

324
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:19,070
HP file stays the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I just go</font>

325
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,650
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that file and then just just point</font>

326
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,750
it to the new directory in that way if

327
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:27,550
the thing barfs then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can just quickly</font>

328
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,550
switch it back to the old version

329
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,279
another nice thing you can do with it is

330
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,910
modifying that PHP dot I guess file so

331
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:41,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do sort of a threshold</font>

332
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:46,839
it's 18<font color="#E5E5E5"> between 10 and 20 for rights to</font>

333
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,940
a log file 2549 logs do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> database and</font>

334
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,510
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stop of the email alert</font>

335
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,040
and a terminating page which would just

336
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,480
be stopped the process so there's

337
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,860
article things you can do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

338
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,610
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that I did want to</font>

339
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,130
mention on this for those this people

340
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,550
have written plug-ins<font color="#E5E5E5"> for popular</font>

341
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,290
content management system so you instead

342
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">of doing this manually you can actually</font>

343
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:17,109
just get a plug-in that maybe somebody

344
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,240
wrote and and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a quick way to</font>

345
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,119
do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've actually been doing that</font>

346
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,069
for I'd say about three months now and I

347
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know I'm just I'm a hands-on guy</font>

348
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">and pinning and I don't trust it I would</font>

349
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,430
rather see the code and control it

350
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,679
myself but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider so</font>

351
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,190
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is kind of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> final part</font>

352
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,790
here is getting into how to handle PHP

353
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,690
in your environment so like I said them

354
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:50,470
are about risk management so my thing is

355
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:54,160
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I translate risk management into</font>

356
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,860
you know secure the definition of secure

357
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,220
is in the eye of the beholder<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

358
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:04,659
obviously we based on that because

359
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:07,120
everybody sees being sick or<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

360
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,030
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain amount of risk that</font>

361
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,429
they're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take so you have all</font>

362
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:15,430
your different<font color="#CCCCCC"> unionist you know I'm up</font>

363
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,320
in DC so we do a lot of the government

364
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:20,170
based stuff but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this has a risk</font>

365
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">management frame framework there's fair</font>

366
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,970
there's octave there's a lot of them

367
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,730
that are out there I mean in the big

368
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,500
thing here is you can look at the data

369
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,230
or the system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to</font>

370
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,350
protect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's you know if it's not</font>

371
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:38,920
that sensitive or it's not that critical

372
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:42,850
then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you it do you loose</font>

373
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,400
security you can still sue<font color="#E5E5E5"> sokurah but</font>

374
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:48,370
you don't have to like

375
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,520
have you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you based on the</font>

376
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,709
value of the data it's worth it not

377
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,440
spending that much money or resources

378
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,390
trying to do that on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand if</font>

379
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,650
you're like working directly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

380
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,650
government and you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

381
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:05,190
offensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> warfare stuff you know maybe</font>

382
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:10,660
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> high security so you would take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

383
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:13,000
lot of you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely invest more</font>

384
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,470
resources in protecting that sort of

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,110
information so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next few slides I</font>

386
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,390
just there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff like you a</font>

387
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,360
few through some of those HP best

388
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,960
practices that I thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> painters</font>

389
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,429
tons of stuff and it's like very

390
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,110
overwhelming of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should and what</font>

391
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,450
you shouldn't do so what I try to do is

392
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,090
if you're that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you maybe pull out you</font>

393
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:41,440
know like five things like these are

394
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:44,169
hopefully the easy things you can do so

395
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,490
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first recommendation for number five</font>

396
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:50,200
is to use some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hardened</font>

397
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,050
environment so that too awesome tool

398
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:57,900
that I'm edge and and you can also look

399
00:19:53,050 --> 00:20:00,120
at PHP suck info for configuration

400
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameters that you may want to modify</font>

401
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:06,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and honest or source code so the issue</font>

402
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:09,040
here is PHP is very easy to learn it's

403
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,200
very easy to write so you have a lot of

404
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">people just write in code but it's just</font>

405
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,730
written horribly and

406
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,300
and camilo not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> low quality but</font>

407
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:23,460
probably also limited security built

408
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:27,760
into so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

409
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:31,600
kind of find it there's the big guys for

410
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,640
reviewing source code stuff which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

411
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,030
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention here but you know the year</font>

412
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,309
if I was looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in terms of you</font>

413
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,160
know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's just running a</font>

414
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:44,260
website I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like this it's like</font>

415
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,809
100 thousand dollar budget for doing

416
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,820
oddity stuff so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just looking for</font>

417
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:52,690
quick stuff that I like in cheap stuff

418
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:56,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could do so one tool that a lot</font>

419
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,929
of people seem to like was NASA and that

420
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,240
can actually do source code analysis on

421
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:03,850
a number of different languages they

422
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,990
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have plug in to reach language the</font>

423
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:11,020
24 h ere PHP<font color="#E5E5E5"> lynn and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pitt and pixie now</font>

424
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:14,380
this is free and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its kind of old</font>

425
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:16,210
but it's better than you know you're

426
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,520
hoping that you can run through it and

427
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,710
it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least at a minimum it's some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

428
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the low-hanging fruit now one</font>

429
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,210
interesting tool that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found which is a</font>

430
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,410
commercial tool but they have a

431
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:32,429
community edition is code secure and for

432
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:35,679
the free version you're limited up to

433
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:37,780
10,000 lines of code so for someone like

434
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,750
myself you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm probably not going</font>

435
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,020
to have that many lines of code so so

436
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,860
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could probably run this</font>

437
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:49,780
so several times and find the sum of the

438
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,790
low-hanging fruit and because it's

439
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,600
supported on to the back in by a

440
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:57,490
commercial vendor your quality is

441
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,490
products into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the supported product the</font>

442
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,130
blog the quality may be higher they're

443
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,290
also assignments and cat a once again

444
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:09,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a full commercial tool but they</font>

445
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:12,940
also have a mini analysis program that

446
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,580
you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try out so number three</font>

447
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,990
is sanitize everything

448
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:21,299
in and out so back in a day there were

449
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:24,600
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have some methods and other</font>

450
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,450
sort of filtering mechanisms to protect

451
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,830
against things like cross-site scripting

452
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:34,140
and sequel in detection on but there's

453
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,779
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of pre-built</font>

454
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,669
filters that are out there so that you

455
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:42,409
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to verify email</font>

456
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:46,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">as an email or or if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to filter</font>

457
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:48,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain types of things out of code so</font>

458
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:51,269
one there's an extension called filter

459
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,870
and so you just do your<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing but</font>

460
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:56,370
you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the if statement in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

461
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,100
instead of putting your variable there

462
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:02,279
that the user in what you just put this

463
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,309
filter thing up all around it and then

464
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:08,789
it you know checks it and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

465
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:11,820
makes it tries to filter out anything

466
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:15,149
volition so what I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to there are</font>

467
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,428
also method in HB that have been all

468
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:19,590
around I've listed some of them there

469
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:22,110
there are also other methods which are

470
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:25,879
more focused on doing system calls I

471
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:29,158
mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should never really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

472
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">look in your page echoed you know call</font>

473
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:36,269
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a system call because that's a</font>

474
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:38,519
yeah definitely not it's a security best

475
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:41,490
practice however there are some methods

476
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:45,169
here that can help parse through that

477
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:50,460
and hopefully filter out<font color="#CCCCCC"> mote malicious</font>

478
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:53,820
content so number<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is avoids equal</font>

479
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,100
concatenated strings so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

480
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good it's like sequel induction</font>

481
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,299
and the most people how actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

482
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:02,700
kind of right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel there they</font>

483
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,580
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there sequel statement in code</font>

484
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,340
and whatever

485
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,379
user input that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will just talk to the</font>

486
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">head there and then they'll just open a</font>

487
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,280
session to the database<font color="#CCCCCC"> makeup make that</font>

488
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,100
call so that's you know that and I mean

489
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:21,399
I started being without one outside

490
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,649
in 2002 2003<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame and back then</font>

491
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,500
the big thing was used prepared database

492
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,660
statements you know that right in almost

493
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later we're still doing the</font>

494
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:34,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">same the same the same thing we're</font>

495
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">building these quarries dynamically and</font>

496
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:41,950
then passing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them off to the database so</font>

497
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:45,550
now it is most recent version has this

498
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:48,460
PDO class okay with PDO<font color="#CCCCCC"> skansen stands</font>

499
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:52,120
for blade well<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what it does is</font>

500
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:56,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">it allows you to do database calls in</font>

501
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,689
the language and it emulates a d a

502
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,960
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end so it kind of gets you</font>

503
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,640
halfway there so so you definitely like

504
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,550
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're passing to the</font>

505
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,100
database you want to use this PDO cost

506
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:12,250
and if for whatever reason you

507
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,730
absolutely can there's is my sequel

508
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">world this escape string method which is</font>

509
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,220
really good but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some edge</font>

510
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,080
cases and the recommendation from from

511
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,270
the research that<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone says though you</font>

512
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,110
should definitely try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this PDO</font>

513
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:33,780
class first and last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor on</font>

514
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:36,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">underline or so this attack to the ph 8</font>

515
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes system that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little</font>

516
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,790
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier the other thing is so most</font>

517
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:45,880
of this talk early focused on looking

518
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:48,940
happenings from a PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> or application</font>

519
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,590
level but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come</font>

520
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:55,180
from the government world so I'm and a

521
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:58,439
defense-in-depth so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

522
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:01,360
definitely want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build these</font>

523
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">defense-in-depth protection so at</font>

524
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,850
network what we'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

525
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:10,000
firewalls or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess is at your platform</font>

526
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,219
level or your OS isn't

527
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,390
other apps keep everything past and

528
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:18,910
up-to-date run AV<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll get some</font>

529
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,210
low-hanging fruit and obviously keep

530
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:24,100
your signatures updated web there at web

531
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,200
server level you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to harden</font>

532
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:31,060
your web server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's class</font>

533
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,730
that you can can use just as in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font>

534
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,860
in additional lay or<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in testing you</font>

535
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:40,930
know doing instead of waiting to get

536
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,300
attacked attack yourself so you know do

537
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:46,660
periodic pen testing so that you can

538
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:51,460
find those problems before the attacker

539
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:55,090
does so just to close out I some general

540
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:59,830
pots here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how I would my</font>

541
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:02,409
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to getting went up SEC with PHP</font>

542
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:07,659
would is I would do if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had listened</font>

543
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:11,350
of pod I'm view is do as many of those

544
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">things as possible just do the do the</font>

545
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,480
easy stuff first<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to</font>

546
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,320
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and then do you know pick</font>

547
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,040
some risk assessment methodology do a

548
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,100
risk assessment and then based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

549
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:31,889
your risk profile is any amount of risk

550
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:35,050
you're willing to take a plement those

551
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,980
additional controls so that you can

552
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:41,020
reduce your wrists down to a paw

553
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:47,800
tolerable level for you and then lastly

554
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:52,780
monitor like oh so is HP Sierra yeah so

555
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:55,180
I got to know you know right so I think

556
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will add like everything in security</font>

557
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,770
I think it depends and i also think

558
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,680
we're asking the wrong question and it

559
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">can anybody guess why for asking I'm</font>

560
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,850
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong question</font>

561
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:16,899
you're what yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is true anyone</font>

562
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:18,940
else no grave takers<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I I</font>

563
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,280
basically think you know II as i

564
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,370
mentioned i'm drinking the risk pool

565
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">late and so I think it it's back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to risk</font>

566
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:31,870
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at is using</font>
