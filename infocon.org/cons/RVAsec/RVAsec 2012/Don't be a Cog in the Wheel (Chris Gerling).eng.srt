when we all get together in one spot we

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,590
seem to to do some really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool stuff you</font>

you might not not might not try you know

182

287
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,240
keep fixing the same problems if you do

288
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,339
then you know don't participate a guess

289
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,640
but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really help help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me or</font>

290
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:50,320
anyone else embrace new methodologies

291
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,899
new technology we share things with our

292
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,070
colleagues threat vectors change risk

293
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:56,230
management looks a lot different today

294
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,000
than it did five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years ago it's</font>

295
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,930
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know different different things</font>

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there so a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of facts I</font>

297
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,170
know I'm not following up some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

298
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:11,109
technical stuff today so you know in

299
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,380
2011 I just looked up cross waves report

300
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,360
and kind of just for a general example

301
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,920
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> over ninety seven percent of</font>

302
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,810
these investigations that they did I

303
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,990
think there were about 200

304
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:24,310
investigations with around 200

305
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,860
investigations that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> report was</font>

306
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,329
based on and ninety-seven percent of

307
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,800
them did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're cited for</font>

308
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:33,609
insufficient firewall policies I mean

309
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,990
how how hard is that really eighty-three

310
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,779
percent were cited for easily guessed

311
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,220
passwords you know I mean it's these are

312
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,079
the same problems that existed the last

313
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and over and over again</font>

369
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,329
its IT we all you know we all do the

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,920
same kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff since we're all</font>

where you know so we're all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

373

team we're all trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve the same</font>

374
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,079
problems so avoid that 925 mentality

375
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,880
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to work hundred</font>

376
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,680
hours a week but you know question

377
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,279
ineffective methodologies don't just do

378
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,540
your job<font color="#CCCCCC"> take outside the box unless you</font>

379
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">like solving the same problem again and</font>

380
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:20,189
again so you know we have rock stars in

381
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,529
our industry you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people often have</font>

382
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,740
the wrong idea about them but they're

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">just people like anyone else you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font>

384
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,950

385
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,440
the pedestal we do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they drive</font>

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,279
change they're the ones that actually

questioned the you know think outside

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">the box and question with the</font>

389
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,930
ineffective methodologies you know say

390
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,279
hi they don't bite<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you be</font>

the change that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enact others</font>

392
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,589
will follow they will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it will</font>

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,229
good sans contacts that I'll reach out

427
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,299
to and they'll you know they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font>

428
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,490
so-and-so is teaching a new course would

429
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:39,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like to talk to them sometimes we'll</font>

430
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,429
have people just email us use aren't we

431
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,600
have a guest submission form that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

432
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,149
could fill out and kind of do their

433
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,399
little thing for longest time we had a

434
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:48,620
guy named our hopper down in Nashville

435
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:51,049
and he would actually reach out and

436
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,840
schedule people and he you know he knew

437
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:57,139
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people that way I think the</font>

438
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">most we've had people from Belgium</font>

439
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:04,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nigeria canada and in halfway across the</font>

440
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,740
world we've had to do some some very

441
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,190
interesting timings it's a you know it's

442
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,299
it's hard to arrange<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sometimes for</font>

443
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the longest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time we were trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

444
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,470
wednesdays at seven thirty and I just

445
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of stopped doing that once I listen</font>

446
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,890
too risky business I was like and these

447
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,360
guys are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something right here</font>

448
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,649
they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> record the reviews offline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

449
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">then splice event makes it so much</font>

450
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:27,489
easier so I do that now and actually it

451
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,350
provides for better quality interviews

452
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,370
when you try to do them and we still

453
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,270
wanted least you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep doing</font>

454
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">some live interviews but it makes it</font>

455
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,160
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually cover a good</font>

456
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,428
swapping material and bullet eyes things

457
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay looks like I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes left I</font>

458
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,600
tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a little fast but yeah</font>

459
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,340
sometimes they reach out to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

460
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,409
a lot of times I'll reach out to them I

461
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,000
just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> have come to know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

462
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,040
people over the years it was a lot

463
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">harder first our first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten episodes are</font>

464
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,050
pretty bad don't listen to those we were

465
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:06,730
just drunk and talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the news</font>

466
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:10,360
but uh yeah yes what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of your</font>

467
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,950
favorite IRC channel well I hang out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

468
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,809
freenode lots we've got our channel

469
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,790
there and Paul calm is there off sec

470
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,070
there's a new extra there's a new group

471
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,860
called malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lu that's the actual</font>

472
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,870
website too<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't they</font>

473
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,580
have a really active IRC channel out and

474
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,139
what they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the trying to</font>

475
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:31,330
create a repository of of malware

476
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,610
analysis kind of reports summaries so

477
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,320
they'll take a lot of the current you

478
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">know malware the zero days the lot of</font>

479
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,770
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> floating out there that's</font>

480
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,240
current and actually actively being used

481
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,150
by organizations like criminal

482
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,559
organizations and they'll fill you know

483
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,150
they'll do their reverse engineering on

484
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,490
it and they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make an Icelander port</font>

485
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,400
about it they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build up like</font>

486
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,500
a kind of free accessible set of

487
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,050
analysis on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all the current</font>

488
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,630
malware so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the like</font>

489
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:01,450
the way the GFI<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for anybody is not</font>

490
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,830
familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> GFI is at an automated sandbox</font>

491
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,630
tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can go and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know submit</font>

492
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,809
stuff too they're trying to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

493
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,040
with actual human analysis so that's

494
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:12,250
probably the coolest one that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

495
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,750
lately that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just got exposed to some</font>

496
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,670
of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones are pound pound</font>

497
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,200
security on freenode there's probably

498
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">three four hundred people in there that</font>

499
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,740
are you know they're there at every

500
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,480
conference they're the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

501
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,550
mainstays a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people hang out in</font>

502
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,160
their security twits there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

503
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,260
cool people in there

504
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,540
but free note seems to be where a lot of

505
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,860
us hang out and there's some other ones

506
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's primarily Ryan</font>

507
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,340
um well actually some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font>

508
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to see over the last few years</font>

509
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,419
are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of showing up now and we've got</font>

510
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,500
a great rich sec I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these</font>

511
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:54,780
guys this past fall and uh you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

512
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">just great to have people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

513
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,410
you know put things together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

514
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,850
actually have people get to you know get

515
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,620
together the meetups that they do or

516
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:05,939
just awesome I think I think we're

517
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,080
working with our labs we're kind of

518
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,870
working out having work you know

519
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,189
community accessible security you know

520
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,870
both our penetration testing lab

521
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,570
something that people can actually just

522
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,429
log into it and use and bang away at and

523
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,409
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have some space to we were</font>

524
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,950
getting a you know we're working towards

525
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:25,080
having some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not you cannot like</font>

526
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,520
the hackerspace but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have six</font>

527
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,960
or eight workstations you know maybe

528
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,460
we'll start doing some<font color="#E5E5E5"> podcasts from</font>

529
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,500
there as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have people come by</font>

530
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,380
and you know you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn forensics</font>

531
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:39,540
or you know malware analysis wherever

532
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:42,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've got a license of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDA so you know I</font>

533
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,970
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just more interest more um</font>

534
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know more interest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in wanting to</font>

535
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,270
actually use this stuff and to get

536
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,730
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn things you know I</font>

537
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,080
mean just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with hack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our VA and it</font>

538
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,760
came about the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> three four years and</font>

539
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">now they've got a nice you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know a nice</font>

540
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,300
rotation of classes you can sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for</font>

541
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's kind of built over the years so</font>

542
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,840
we're kind of we want to start offering

543
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,030
more security classes maybe you know

544
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,050
have some of them there and just kind of

545
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,820
get people involved in learning

546
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,050
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> different you know</font>

547
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,450
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to learn whether it's</font>

548
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:12,300
forensics or reverse engineering or

549
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,760
penetration testing or you know really

550
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:18,720
anything secure coding we've got a good

551
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">swath</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of talent here so you know events</font>

552
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,020
like this and meetups and things like

553
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,080
that or really drive drive everyone to

554
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,410
learn so I think we're doing a good job

555
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,409
of it

556
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:39,740
any other questions all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

557
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm i'm under time but</font>
