download them they have a lot of notes

12
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,599
in what I see is the presenter notes

13
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,610
including URLs more stats and everything

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,890

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,859

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,800
have to kind of stick to the notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a</font>

18
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,439
big fan<font color="#E5E5E5"> of QA or heckling during a talk</font>

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,850

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,369
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a surprise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when someone said hey you</font>

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,770
should give a talk on that I was like

28
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,110
yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a hobby we'll</font>

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,259
see and I started actually looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,799
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of it and yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,070
we ended up so for those of you who

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,020
aren't familiar I speak my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind I use</font>

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,369
bad language which is you know

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,170
situational one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about</font>

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">arata and nutrition org is it's a hobby</font>

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,270
website that means we have no corporate

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,158
backing that may seem like a down side

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,920
until you realize that that also means I

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,810
get to say whatever the fuck I want

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever about whoever not have to</font>

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever comes out of my mouth is my own</font>

up<font color="#CCCCCC"> or they say something that hurts your</font>

67
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,859
fun rant about them coming down the road

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,810
how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> journalists what was the last</font>

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,260
time you saw a journalist actually take

70
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,030
someone to task it's rare<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sad</font>

71
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,700
it's a dismal state of affairs when

72
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,100
journalists don't have the integrity or

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,760
the balls to go after a company is doing

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,030
stupid shit bloggers and it happens

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,679
every once in a while can't rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

76
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,780
publishers like four books they care

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,269
about the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line they do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not care</font>

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,310
about anything else and how about the

79
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,320
law like an attorney general their

80
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,650
plates are full what they see here is

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,560
considered too low on the totem pole in

82
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,880
the meantime that<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaves us until</font>

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,560
someone better comes along and we

84
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">sincerely hope someone better than us</font>

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,620
comes along any day now<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be greatly</font>

86
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,750
appreciated I could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time off so</font>

who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind a rock there's three main</font>

analyst he does a

90
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:14,090
the work on the site updates probably

91
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">60s seventy percent of our pages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ligar</font>

he makes the entire domain in the box

93
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,250
run he is retired as far as actually

94
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,990
writing the errata but he does still do

95
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,850
proofreading and technical editing and

96
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,520
me the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim to fame</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i had is that</font>

97
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,500
i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dumbass who said take your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shots</font>

98
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,159
at me I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> guard the rest of them and</font>

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,570
you'll see why that happens in a minute

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,630
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a staffing problem and we</font>

101
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">always have we've had two big calls for</font>

102
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:49,610
volunteers first time one person stuck

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,590
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liger second time CJ I and the</font>

104
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,220
rest of them flaked they would last

105
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:58,700
anywhere from days<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a couple weeks at</font>

106
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,490
best everyone says I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the</font>

107
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,630
project I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

108
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,150
then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say wait a minute this</font>

109
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,880
requires me to do all 30 minutes a week

110
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,099
of work and there's no glory behind it

111
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,010
there's no pay there's no hookers

112
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,160
there's no blow screw this you know and

113
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,900
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> out as fast as they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came in it</font>

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,900
requires almost no training other than

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,549
research verify and be thorough so if

116
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,260
you know how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google and you're a</font>

117
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,240
little OCD you're perfect for the job

118
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:35,180
the longevity of this project is due to

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:37,340
a very few small of us crazies so we

120
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,920
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly have the most ugly image</font>

121
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's a reason for that being</font>

122
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">huggly doesn't cut it it's the nature of</font>

123
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,860
a rock we are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical and we tell</font>

124
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,479
the truth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the truth is often brutal</font>

125
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,680
so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Batman we needed a symbol to</font>

126
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">invoke fear thus plasma and for those</font>

127
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know Joanna Goldman she does</font>

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,729
all these great little animal creatures

129
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:05,510
and one of hers was buck and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font>

130
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:08,090
I need the evil cousin of buck and

131
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,930
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> she came up with and we</font>

132
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,950
think it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> fitted so a-rod is all</font>

133
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,810
around us

134
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,870
it's all about showing the bad in our

135
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,060
industry right we are basically auditors

136
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,460
of our industry how many in here have

137
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,740
done any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of auditing pen testing</font>

138
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,989
anything along those lines who here

139
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,080
professionally points out the crappy

140
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,720
things and someone else's work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

141
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,849
all we do yet somehow there's this huge

142
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,830
disconnect people like oh wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font>

143
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,960
what you're doing is so evil or wrong or

00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:21,009
know what building he lives in so these

more careful in the evidence you know in

185
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:33,789
this case it was like hey I've got a

phone it's got a camera I'm at this

anger and seriously that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a joke</font>

any time any of you follow me on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

and you see a huge like 3am rant just

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:06,189
like pure rage they're the best but they

203
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:26,079
say this industry that you are

206
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:35,620
downhill very quickly with no hope of

207
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:37,689
recovering so the brief history we gone

208
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,399
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sections for the most</font>

part they're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> there if the literature</font>

210
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,050
is going one that went away early on<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a rotten in books so like</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security book would come out and would</font>

say oh this is an error<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is bad that</font>

214
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,620
section would have ballooned up pretty

215
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,829
fast and it took too much time media

216
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:02,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">charlatan statistics statistics has died</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to do statistics the main</font>

223
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,170
thing is they don't qualify or disclaim

224
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,230
them oh well we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

this number by this metric or whatever

and that's all they'll tell you well

227
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,149
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go through all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details of</font>

244
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:20,060
don't really care about style so the

original<font color="#CCCCCC"> might actually that was</font>

246
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:27,079
probably pre tags back then yeah and now

247
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,480
we've got fancy HTML tables and man

248
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,160
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font>

how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> they regret when I learned how</font>

250
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,279
to do HTML tables is that opened the

251
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,990
door to the nicer plagiarism write-ups

252
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,370
and everything you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the little</font>

things back in august of two thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

254
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,899
had to use archive.org great project the

255
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,430
bottom of our page said after a recent

256
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,290
comment I'd like to solicit ideas on a

better name for the site feel free to

00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,490
one of the recent questions we've got

262
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:08,120
and I think this one was a space room

263
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,339
question ledger yes one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yours I think</font>

264
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,760
anyway so what kind of money's involved

265
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,940
in this project this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete</font>

266
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,100
picture but this is most of it we've

267
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,910
gone through several boxes we've had

268
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,190
hosting costs the two thousand and the

269
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,180
three euros means it's well upwards of

270
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,709
that but we had an informal agreement

271
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,959
we get out stuff we<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Flass</font>

321
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:58,880
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is look at back in 92</font>

signature updates fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work correctly</font>

330
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,240
often have disastrous side effects like

331
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,340
oh you can't boot your box anymore sorry

for any of these companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> no ok so</font>

344
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,860
McAfee definitely up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> semantics</font>

346
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just the thing about looking at</font>

347
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,260
the numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said download the</font>

348
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:20,390
slides to have some better examples so

349
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:22,520
like a verra of IRA or whatever to one

353
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:35,630
and knowing so yeah there's a wide range

354
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,490
what happened and it's also interesting

355
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:41,150
to watch how these different products

356
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:43,410
will accidentally flag their competitor

357
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,300
yeah it's like hmm

358
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:49,350
what happens if we make our competitor

359
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,849
go away yeah legal threats these are

360
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases of vendors using the threat of</font>

361
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:56,339
legal action either a lawsuit dmca or

362
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:59,040
something despite for suppress security

363
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,810
research there are more out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there than</font>

364
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,699
we have on the page we're still trying

365
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">to dig them up if you hear about them</font>

366
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,980
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pointer will go to</font>

367
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,470
the research will dig into the law cases

368
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,179
if we need to we will interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

369
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,030
find out what we want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when this</font>

370
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:18,020
happens and we know it's happened a ton

371
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:21,720
for example cert back in the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in</font>

372

late 80s Early 90s they received legal

373
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,260
threats is like routine but

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately cert is not fully part of</font>

00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:58,650
mean it was somehow resolved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

386
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,600
favor of the researcher so yeah it sucks

387
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,600
that the company went and threatened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,850
approximants some of them are as high as

457
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:11,639
ninety-nine point nine percent yeah and

458
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,520
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are as low as i want to say</font>

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:27,300
three other authors one of his authors

463
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,790
was actually listed as a technical

464
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,889
editor who for some reason didn't just

465
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,870
technical edit he wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thirds of</font>

466
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,750
the book and plagiarized from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wikipedia</font>

467
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:39,659
anyway so Jason Street found out he was

468
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">devastated he went to syngress said hey</font>

469
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,530
we've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix this he organized a new</font>

470
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,360
group they wrote a new version

471
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,090
dissecting the hack 2 point 0 or

472
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,610
whatever is out and plagiarism free so

473
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is a great example of well we</font>

474
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,459
fucked up what we're going to fix it

475
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,600
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make it right and i</font>

476
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe they also offered to refund</font>

477
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,070
anyone on the original book but for the

478
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,050
most part these books are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

479
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,550
circulation and that's mainly because a

480
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,440
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are self-published and</font>

482
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,510
because hey they're making<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so on</font>

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:42,120
there is a good chance of it biggest

495
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,620
call out cengage don't either books they

496
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,159
have the most plagiarism and they give

497
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,389
the shit the least security companies

498
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,550
cases where security companies botched

499
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,860
security all in an ironic and

500
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,270
embarrassing fashion so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

501
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,959
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the companies that are there</font>

00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:02,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in the opposite they hurt</font>

you they made you more vulnerable they

504
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,219
screwed up and it's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> in really</font>

505
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,540
stupid ways like when these companies

506
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,540
come to a conference in lecture you oh

507
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,940
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this and to factor and data</font>

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,810
loss prevention or whatever go check

509
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,160
this page and then go ask them again and

510
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:22,520
not that I would change<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but they</font>

511
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,310
bailed RS a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago they had a</font>

512
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,680
booth at a different conference and they

513
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:30,110
let the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> overnight so I left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them a</font>

nice note with like printed out a rod<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

515
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:37,120
all their previous security blunders

516
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,120
still curious how they responded to that

517
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,530
among these attrition or grin there

518
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:47,420
twice to defacements biggest offenders

<font color="#CCCCCC">symantec 28 security companies that spam</font>

companies that sell integrity some

00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,810
itself anti-spam solutions and then they

524
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,840
turn around and blast you with email you

525
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:06,020
didn't ask for worst offender true

526
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,540
secure four times obviously we can see

527
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,639
that this is a growing problem if you

528
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,139
get mail from a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> company that</font>

pitching their product or service send

531
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,320
it to us with full headers just make

532
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,870
sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very clear that you did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

533
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,850
opt in that it didn't come from like oh

534
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,320
I attended this conference I gave my

535
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,000
email address and I didn't read the fine

536
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,490
print that said we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call the</font>

537
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,130
vendors in the you know vendor booths so

538
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:36,500
be very clear about it software so we

539
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:39,830
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> track it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> errata but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

heavily involved with 0 SPD<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and 0 SPD</font>

541
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,699
be we actually have a classification

542
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:47,179
system where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can track security</font>

543
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:49,880
software once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the software there</font>

544
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:55,400
to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as our abilities makes</font>

545
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:58,010
you insecure as of may 16 1700 and for

546
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,480
vulnerabilities two percent of all

547
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,190
documented vulnerability

548
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,500
that we know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> or in security</font>

549
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:09,770
software and that numbers actually

550
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:13,540
probably hire anyone see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

551
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:17,810
problem here I mean how dismal is that

552
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:21,230
so arata done right the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part we are</font>

553
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:24,530
behind we have a lack of resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

554
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,750
lack of time lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest every once</font>

555
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,149
in a while something works out and data

556
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,120
loss is the perfect example the original

557
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:34,760
concept was in 2001 it's a long time ago

558
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,070
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> data loss is a recent thing people</font>

559
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,460
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah dlp and data loss and</font>

560
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,649
this and that that goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like</font>

561
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,570
2007-8 something Jake yeah here take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

562
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">two thousand ones when we thought yeah</font>

563
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,889
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track all this and in 2005 we</font>

564
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,590
actually don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute it and</font>

565
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,140
eventually in 2008 we moved it over to

566
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,310

with it so yeah this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original</font>

570
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,260
mail i sent to the internal team saying

571
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:09,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah we should track all this before and</font>

572
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:13,090
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah we had 80 HTML and some</font>

573
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:16,310
links<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no search distributed in csv</font>

574
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,770
no metrics no real classification system

575
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,389
then afterwards when it was moved to SF

576
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,639
they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll give it its own</font>

577

site we'll have a real developer we're

578
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,920
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to coat the whole thing extensive</font>

579
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:31,010
metrics expanded sources of information

580
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:33,200
anyone can submit now and now they've

581
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:36,230
got a dedicated data input person or two

582
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,840
or three now yeah there's that many data

583
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,490
breaches to the three full-time people

584
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,590
to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of data</font>

585
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:50,990
breaches that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy so there's the</font>

586
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:52,580
stats that's grim you know where's our

587
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,950
security right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now all the security that</font>

we're peddling is vendors all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

589
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,330
security that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're preaching is you</font>

590
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,860
know members of the security industry or

591
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,840
is it actually going is it really

592
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,760
helping anyone evidence says otherwise

593
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,240
so confronting charlatans and I know

594
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,970
I've got one fan that's going to

595

hear all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this does it happen yes a</font>

596
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:17,370
lot more frequently than realize so the

597
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,949
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> process is someone gets on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

598
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,989
radar doesn't matter how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> submit the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">god this guy pisses me off whatever</font>

601
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:31,230
somehow he<font color="#E5E5E5"> hits on the radar from there</font>

602
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,900
it starts as a name and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine if</font>

603
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:37,200
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go the case it really is</font>

604
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,200
a logical step by step<font color="#E5E5E5"> progression we do</font>

605
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,120
our research google of 10 15 20 pages

606
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,850
deep we want to find all the articles

607
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,629
good and bad once we finally know what

608
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:50,969
we determine is this a one-off situation

609
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,800
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pattern what is the intent as</font>

are they trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defraud people are</font>

613
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,430
they profiting off of it we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

614
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:07,290
at all of that and determine is this

615
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:08,940
person a menace<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our industry if so we</font>

616
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,510
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up we try to gather as much</font>

617
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:15,090
evidence as we can once that's done we

618
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,590
submitted internally to our team we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

623
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,780
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the questions that came up before</font>

624
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,389
this talk is you know do you ever give

625

626
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,840

him yeah so again you know a legitimate

656
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,840
honest person doesn't lie to the police

657

00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:29,049
determines that no I'm not a threat he

693
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:31,929
understands because I show them you know

694

everyone's left except for the uncle so

702
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:50,708
eventually the manager comes out and

703
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,940
he's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa wait a minute you know</font>

legal tricks and if I tricks I mean

00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:37,410
court misconduct in some cases this one

we were named as one of the John Doe

857

00:43:53,189 --> 00:43:56,729
which I'm getting into there was a

970
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:59,939
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this it was apparently</font>

975
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,410
that works together and that we didn't

976
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:15,809
have actives and this was during the

977
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,969
denial of service attack so no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

978
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:20,099
really verify that our site was or was

979
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:21,839
not there so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the denial of service</font>

980
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:23,759
attack ended and everything was back up

981
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,859
and by the way security<font color="#CCCCCC"> arata the second</font>

domain was there with all the content it

984
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,160
hasn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about that well that</font>

1071
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:28,390
explanation it wasn't as widespread as

1072
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:30,730
we thought one security company article

00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,200
of the story and say yep they were right

1079
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,240
we were wrong and one article

1080
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,310
practically removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Greg Evans he</font>

1081

gave us new information we're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> our age</font>
