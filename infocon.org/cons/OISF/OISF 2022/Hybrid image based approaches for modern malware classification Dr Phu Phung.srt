to tie you to it but

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,560
um

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,760
all right so

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,040
i know we didn't have a lot of time for

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
break but uh

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,280
uh we're gonna we're gonna start with

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,680
the next presentation uh

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
dr fufung's over at ud and um

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,960
after he's done presenting uh before we

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
break for lunch real quick we're going

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,520
to do some prize drawings

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
so stay don't run out fast

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
and i think

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
the lunches will be here like right

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,880
around noon

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
um i think there was

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
everybody already paid for lunches and

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
stuff like that i think we had a couple

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
extras because somebody cancelled they

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,399
ordered and they'd show up

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
so i think if you're one of those ones

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,399
that paid late there may be a launch

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,840
available for you because somebody

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
should um ordered lunch and they didn't

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,200
show up and they didn't pay so

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,719
now you got to eat their lunch

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,360
all right all right so over to you

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,640
all right so um

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,360
you

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
you hear me

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,920
oh no it's off mute

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,079
yep

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,319

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,840
thank you everyone to stay uh here so uh

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
before

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
lunch this is the hardship like time

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
i hope you'll still be here and my talk

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
still interests you

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
so i don't have a slide about who i am

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
but

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,680
i grabbed this hat from matt thank you

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
matt i'm a hacker

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
okay

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
so the reason i confident saying that

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
because i

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
train my student to be a hacker and i

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
tell them like that and matt also

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
mentioned hacker is not crime right

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,879
hacker is different from attacker that

70
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,280
that scott mentioned so so we are good

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,519
right but i i just put it back so

72
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,760
so who i am i'm a

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
faculty member uh at the university of

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
dayton computer science department i

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,840
joined ud seven years ago

76
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
so

77
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,560
yeah not too new not to like

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
there so

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,720
so

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
if you notice that

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,640
in this conference

82
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,840
i didn't i'm only one from university do

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
i yes right so

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,519
um

85
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
so what is the

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,159
talk i will give you today uh now maybe

87
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,040
we may have some people um

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,280
uh on uh virtual i know at least one uh

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
i invite

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
he from houston so he worked at the

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,799
university at least and i tried to hire

92
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040

so uh

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,200
so we have one hour so i think maybe i

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
will uh

97
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,280
spend a couple of minutes to

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,840
talk about some non-technical stuff

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,360
before i go to my talk it's a little bit

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,798
more technical

101
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,759
uh

102
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,399
so i know from john last night that uh

103
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,440
maybe uh some of you guys have a top

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
secret uh clearance so i just want to

105
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,560
clarify that you should not skeptical to

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
talk to me because i'm a u.s citizen

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
even though

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,440
so i um

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,160
uh

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,320
and i came original coming from vietnam

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
so i have a long journey

112
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,280
to here so i

113
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
i got my bachelor in vietnam and then i

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,560
moved to south korea for my master and

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
then i go to sweden for my phd and then

116
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
chicago for boston and then i land here

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,479
and i i i believe that i will stay here

118
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,919
so

119
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,520
a funny thing that i want to share

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,720
before my talk is that when i do my phd

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,919
my main topic is about a reference

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
monitor

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
so reference monitor is the way that

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
like related to you guys talking like

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
how we monitor the behavior of the

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
system to make sure that the system will

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,840
not you know have been compromised or

128
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
something

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,039
and it's funny that you know

130
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,160
that

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
idea

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
is come from

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,320
um

134
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
you know what it's come from air force

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,919
report

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,320
based here in dayton and i never know

137
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
something and until i came here and i

138
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,919
prepared my lectures so in my lecture

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
it's like oh this is addison and this

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
air force base before so

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,919
something you know fun so i want to

142
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
share with you guys so so hopefully i

143
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,759
could stay here for long um

144
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,280
and also

145
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,800
i will introduce a little bit about

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
what i'm doing later on

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,479
so today what i want to talk about is

148
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,360
the recent research i'm doing

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
in my in my lab

150
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,560
so what the message that maybe at the

151
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
end of this you may

152
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
forgot about

153
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
maybe some technical detail

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,759
so

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,080
i just want to bring up like the

156
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,880
takeaway from my talk will be

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
maybe to answer two questions that you

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,280
may ask before my talk so the first

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
question you may ask is what the hell

160
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,639
this guy doing over

161
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,479
there and the second question is uh you

162
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,240
might okay what

163
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,120
maybe

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,080
my expected answer for you guys is okay

165
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
this guy do something cool

166
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,479
have some impact and

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,800
and it's state of the art it's not like

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
20 years old 10 years old it's recently

169
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,039
right

170
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,120
and uh one thing that i want to know

171
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
that is tend to the organization i know

172
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
that this talk like before lunch is not

173
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,759
a good time however my talk is exactly

174
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
the follow-up topic of math and

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
follow-up topic of score they already

176
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
explained some terminology

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
something that i will show you without

178
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,680
their talk maybe i can

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
i need more time to to explain about

180
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,560
that but thank you so so my talk will be

181
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
related to that right

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,639
all right so

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,520
uh the second takeaway boy that i want

184
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,639
to

185
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,759
i'll do it later the second point and

186
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
for the purpose of today is

187
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,800
i know logan already talked to me uh

188
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
like and the first that is the question

189
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,919
he asked me right so i already uh give

190
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
you there the second thing i want to do

191
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,160
is okay can we do some partnership

192
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
uh as i see here only me from university

193
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
and you guys uh from industry

194
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,400
so

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
that is the purpose

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
for this talk as well okay

197
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
this is something i'm i'm looking for

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
for for my my career as well i don't

199
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,479
want to be

200
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,879
university do something that isolated

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,800
with the industry

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,120
our industry do something like isolated

203
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,080
to the university i want to be a

204
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,199
a

205
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
you know a joy collaboration and

206
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,720
long-term collaboration long-term

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
partnership and that is i've been doing

208
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,680
in the past five seven years so so i

209
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
will show you later okay so that it do

210
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,199
take away that

211
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,000
um that i i want you to

212
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
be aware of i i'm open to talk after

213
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,000
lunch during the london or something

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
right and at john manchin we have a

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
table over there to show you about what

216
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
we are doing over there right

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
so okay so

218
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
a little bit long so

219
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,200
so now back to the top that i will do

220
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
some of the term that you already

221
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,240
see from scott like malware right

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,920
ransomware is malware right and malware

223
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,320
including ransomware so

224
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
uh you guys do some technical stuff okay

225
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,519
how to

226
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
understand the marker how to

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
analyze the microwave you need like i ir

228
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,600
you need the technique of you know uh

229
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
analyze the circle to i know okay this

230
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,959
is the malware right

231
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,680
so i i doing the same thing

232
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,560
here

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,040
but i do it i didn't do it like manually

234
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
i do it using

235
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
some technique

236
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
so the technique that i'm using now

237
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,839
in this particular talk is

238
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,240
hybrid image based

239
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
approach so what is that i will explain

240
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,680
to you right um so

241
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
so as you may know that uh

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
i believe that in every of your computer

243
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
if you use

244
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,240
it for your own maybe

245
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
you do not but if you use your

246
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
organization computer i believe that you

247
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
are required to install the

248
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,839
antivirus software do you

249
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,880
right

250
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,040
um and maybe i asked matt this uh scott

251
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
this question uh

252
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,399
like

253
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,200
if

254
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
antivirus software can scan the

255
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,480
ransomware yes or no

256
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,680
correct

257
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,240
that is exactly the the thing that not

258
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
in the real world now

259
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,760
antiviral software is

260
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
almost dead

261
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,600
with this kind of new stuff

262
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
they cannot do anything with this

263
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
because the the technique that josh has

264
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,519
mentioned off location like i believe

265
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
that hundred percent of

266
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
modern malware have application

267
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,959
correct

268
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,760
and

269
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,160
and in that case no of the antivirus

270
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
software can detect them

271
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
completely that for this kind of new

272
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
world right

273
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,279
then what they do they just compare

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,240
the

275
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
uh okay in this marker they have a

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,920
a b c d and they scan and they compare

277
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,000
that but nowadays

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,079
scott already confirmed with me right

279
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,760
it's not possible

280
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
so

281
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
so another approach for that is like we

282
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
do the machine learning

283
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,680
so machine is

284
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
better than human

285
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,560
so they

286
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
they do some so most of the machine

287
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,959
learning approach for for for malware

288
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,200
detection is they do

289
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
supervising learning supervised mean

290
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,000
that

291
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
they need some aspect like scott like

292
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
like like uh math to to to identify some

293
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,920
of the features

294
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
and then they they uh

295
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,560
they need to have some label okay this

296
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
software is malware this software is not

297
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
malware so they do some it's called

298
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
labeling right and then they have an

299
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,880
algorithm so this algorithm is um do you

300
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,760
we have something here

301
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
uh yeah so

302
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
right so so this this is the algorithm

303
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,440
right so algorithm here is to

304
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,000
identify it is a malware or not malware

305
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,639
so in this example is car not car right

306
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,440
but before that before that

307
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
you see the picture here i like this

308
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
feature and by the way uh some of the

309
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,800
pictures are still from internet so i

310
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,959
have a source here so uh if you want to

311
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,800
check right so

312
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,760
they they need you see this feature

313
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
you also use this feature right or you

314
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,839
also use the picture about this like

315
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
there needs some aspect here

316
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
right to to identify

317
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
first and then

318
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,920
the more sample they have

319
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,639
the better the accuracy of the the

320
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
system is so let's say you say 99 90 90

321
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,680
92

322
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,959
96

323
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,760
so

324
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,399
the more sample they have so

325
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
the better they will identify the uh the

326
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,360
thing right

327
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
so uh

328
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
so that that is that is the

329
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
um studied a little bit about the

330
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,279
uh

331
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,519
the field right the machine learning of

332
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,240
that of

333
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,839
detecting the malware

334
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
but that is just the overview

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
so in

336
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
recent

337
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
research in recent research

338
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,079
there are a lot of different approaches

339
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
and direct direction to

340
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,440
to do this to do the to do this the

341
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,279
first step the future instruction and

342
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,279
what in the future right

343
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,320
so so like what scott showed for you is

344
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
that like he

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,680
need to read the code

346
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
and then

347
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,839
do something right to identify okay do

348
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,120
this do that do that but uh machine they

349
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,440
cannot do like that right so the machine

350
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
we need to have some algorithm to do

351
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
this automatically right

352
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,639
so here is an overview of

353
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,000
like what people are doing um right now

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
so if you can see this i like this

355
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,240
feature because you see that is it's

356
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
can we

357
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,560
use mouse instead

358
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
oh

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
yeah

360
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,040
so

361
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,760
yeah

362
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
so you see that there's a lot of boxes

363
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
here right

364
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,360
so they have that so basically there are

365
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,279
two there are two

366
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,760
um two lines you see two light over

367
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,560
there

368
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,760
behavior

369
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,000
or signature-based right

370
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
so behavior they mean like okay they

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
identify

372
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
like what this

373
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
uh program doing

374
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,800
signature-based means the traditional

375
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
one they will identify the code

376
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,519
so so and then they will combine this

377
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,639
together

378
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,720
to have a different machine learning

379
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
algorithm so you see like the bottom

380
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
there are a lot of different machine

381
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
learning right

382
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
so

383
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
i asked you this question

384
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,120
in these pictures

385
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,920
what is the most important

386
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
box

387
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
that

388
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
you think

389
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
it will be

390
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,440
helped the most for the microwave

391
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,440
detection

392
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,880
[Music]

393
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
so

394
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
so

395
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,920
by the way uh

396
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,720
i i start my research about like 20

397
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
years ago uh but this kind of research

398
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
uh i did it's about

399
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
like less than four years so i'm still

400
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,440
new in that

401
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
i am not the expert in machine learning

402
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,480
so i

403
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
i do not know

404
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,880
a lot about this one uh all of the stuff

405
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
that i'm presenting to you guys today

406
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,199
done by my my students and collaborator

407
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,519
so but what i

408
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,440
the my question back to my question what

409
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,279
is the most important in my opinion in

410
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
in our opinion the most important point

411
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,199
here is

412
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,600
this toolbox

413
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
feature feature feature what are the

414
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,600
features

415
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
that you can capture

416
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,519
to put the machine learning

417
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,720
so

418
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,959
whenever you have a good feature more

419
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
feature then the machining will do

420
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,399
better

421
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
otherwise the machining will be

422
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
like useless

423
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,759
what is the most important to machine

424
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,279
learning model

425
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,839
if you ask the data scientist

426
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,800
who

427
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,880
is there anyone here data scientist

428
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
what is the most important for for data

429
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,279
science

430
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,959
the data data data data right if you

431
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
have no data then you have nothing so

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
features are data

433
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,799
so in this case if you have a malware

434
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,199
you have data but malware is not data

435
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
itself you need to have a step

436
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,400
to

437
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
put the marker into a data

438
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,439
that can be understand by the machine

439
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
learning models so that is the most

440
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,679
important step right

441
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,240
and and the work that i show in today to

442
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,280
you is the one that our contribution

443
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,039
what is the step we we are doing over

444
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,559
there right

445
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,160
so uh

446
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,240
yeah so normally so what are the

447
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
challenges of this

448
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
so there are two challenges that my

449
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,919
research tried to do

450
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,600
the picture that i just dropped from

451
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,559
over there we we need to have a step to

452
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,240
do the future instruction from the

453
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
malware

454
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,840
right and normally uh

455
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,200
as i mentioned

456
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,880
like scott just showing you right

457
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,440
normally we need an expert like scott to

458
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,200
to do some identification okay this

459
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
smartway this mod will have this data

460
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,880
right so it will be very tough so if you

461
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
let's say you admit amazing that like

462
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,080
there's like million of different sample

463
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
of malware like can you do it by human

464
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
like that like almost impossible right

465
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,640
so if we do it like by machine then of

466
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,160
course is is it's much better

467
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,600
the second

468
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
challenge that

469
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,160
scott already helped me to to to explain

470
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
that and i mentioned to you earlier 100

471
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,360
percent of the malware nowadays i call

472
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,160
it modern malware

473
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
using obligation technique

474
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,720
so so that's why the antivirus software

475
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,799
scan it and

476
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,480
do not detect it

477
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,200
right so application of banking or

478
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,480
encrypting

479
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
uh that technique is called uh invasion

480
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,400
right so the so they want to to to

481
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,080
invade the the the traditional antivirus

482
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
software and to do that

483
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
they will create a new variance i

484
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
highlight the variant and scott already

485
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
helped me to explain that variant right

486
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
and it's very simple it's like in the in

487
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
similar river i

488
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,679
we know about covet we know corona virus

489
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,960
right so that exactly the same thing

490
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
in the real world in the biology one

491
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,480
like corona virus in the version one the

492
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,559
creator like delta variant the qa uh

493
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,640
like another variant and very the same

494
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,919
way here

495
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,640
right so they they they write one and

496
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,679
then they

497
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,600
change the code even though it's the

498
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,320
same virus but it's it's it's go to

499
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,640
another version so that they try to

500
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,600
escape the the detection right so these

501
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,160
are two big challenges

502
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
in the research that that

503
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,280
that i

504
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,679
that motivate my my research

505
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,840
so

506
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,679
here i give you just example of the

507
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,080
application right the the real code is

508
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,799
something like in a you see it's two

509
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,039
like the code but then

510
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,520
when they deploy the code they will

511
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,200
change it into b

512
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,880
so that the the the the the antivirus

513
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
software will not detect that right so

514
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,480
that is just example and i'll give you

515
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
more example uh good thing is that matt

516
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,000
scott already explained to you right so

517
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
for example you see the original code

518
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,520
they put something uh or they they like

519
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
you see here they put something like uh

520
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
you know this one like some of you the

521
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
hacker you know this uh nlp right

522
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,760
and it'll be like if you do um uh buffer

523
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
overflow attack you know that right you

524
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,520
put just the the comment that do nothing

525
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
do nothing but just move the execution

526
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
so that is will

527
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,039
is

528
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,159
semantically is the same but the if you

529
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
look at the code it's different right

530
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,960
uh or backing so

531
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
so the challenge here is that they will

532
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,200
pass

533
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,080
the the traditional antivirus software

534
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
right

535
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,120
so

536
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,000
that uh

537
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,679
the challenges

538
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,159
that when you do this gap step

539
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,640
you need to deal with right

540
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,600
so

541
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,120
my research question and motivation is

542
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,559
can we have something

543
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,880
some method to

544
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
still detect the malware but can

545
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,559
overcome this kind of of the the

546
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,720
challenges like i said

547
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
we don't need the expert we don't need

548
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,679
uh we don't care about what variant you

549
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
have if you are the malware i detect

550
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,760
that you are my way even you rewrite

551
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,840
this to do something else to put

552
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,400
something else like off vocation right

553
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,120
so so that is basically the the research

554
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
that that i show you

555
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,240
and

556
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,159
as i mentioned um

557
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,240
this is the new live research that i am

558
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,320
doing in my lab right now so

559
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,840
and by the way i

560
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
i share something with you at i share

561
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,360
with

562
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
we have dinner last night with the the

563
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
organizer i share with you that

564
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,919
i believe that maybe new with you as

565
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,799
well

566
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,919
um

567
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,880
so you uh in uh

568
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,280
we are different world but i don't

569
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,919
think that is that should be isolated it

570
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,960
should be

571
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
something you know common so that i

572
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
joined the community

573
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
here

574
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,200
so normally uh

575
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
in in the academic conference

576
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,280
we have to pay money to be present

577
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,480
so

578
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,120
so for example nasa network i have a

579
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,720
conference in spain

580
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,280
uh i will present but um i don't want to

581
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,480
go i do virtually so even i do vertu i i

582
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,600
have to pay the registration fee uh

583
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,760
900

584
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,679
so that so maybe something new to you

585
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,760
right but that we do like we do we do

586
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,960
every every time

587
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,840
[Laughter]

588
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
so yeah

589
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,520
so so so that that is the thing so what

590
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
i'm doing that so um the the work that i

591
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,080
the reason i mentioned to you at the

592
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,039
book i

593
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,760
um there are two two venue two type

594
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,080
venue to to to publish what you are

595
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,960
doing

596
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
in a kind of way so the first one is to

597
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,799
present in the conference the second one

598
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,760
is to uh to to just publish in the

599
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
journal right so to provide internal

600
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
nowadays more channel they charm money

601
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,200
to to to publish but they still have

602
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,720
like the public's one so i i i published

603
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
this in two

604
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,159
uh journal not conference so i didn't

605
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,080
pay so

606
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,960
so the first one i will present to you

607
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,080
and of course we have uh like how many

608
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,600
minutes we have

609
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
less than 30 minutes now i will be

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
very very general i will not go like in

611
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
technical detail like scott mentioned

612
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,679
right so i just give you

613
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,720
an overview of what we are doing to

614
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,440
overcome the challenges that that i just

615
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,400
mentioned to you and i i i hope that you

616
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,000
you you know the challenge and you know

617
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,799
the motivation um so i browse here for

618
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,960
some question if you have before i move

619
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,120
to the detail

620
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,480
yes

621
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
in a biological system

622
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,880
viruses tend to mutate variants based

623
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
upon environmental pressures

624
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,440
is there any way that you can

625
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,840
observe the

626
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,279
environmental pressures inside of the

627
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,760
computer that would cause them to change

628
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
make a variant or this to attack a

629
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
certain client as opposed to somebody

630
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
else

631
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,520
what do you mean about the biological

632
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,520
virus

633
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,200
was there a pressure that you can

634
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
identify

635
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,559
that caused them to change that barrier

636
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,520
so maybe that might be more for for

637
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,279
scott have you seen that that's kind of

638
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,799
something where when i started going

639
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,880
over the ransomware attack waiting to be

640
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
a ball yeah the

641
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,760
pressure is they start using the like

642
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
shadow happens so the ransomware change

643
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,919
to building the

644
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,919
so it's possible that somebody could put

645
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,640
a honeypot in there force them to make a

646
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,159
change that would be identified

647
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,520
so it's basically a lot of it's not

648
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
polymorphic so they don't change

649
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,080
themselves

650
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,200
an attacker needs to rewrite the code

651
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,480
writing the code

652
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,200
so i i think your question is uh

653
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,799
the answer is very similar to the

654
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,640
real-life the real world like the

655
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,279
coronavirus why why they they have a

656
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,720
different variant

657
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,440
i think this same answer right they want

658
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,080
to avoid for example in coronavirus they

659
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,760
want to avoid the vaccine

660
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
they want to avoid the

661
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,679
yeah

662
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,400
right right so so the same here like

663
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,120
like if you have a detect them already

664
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,240
then then they have no chance to execute

665
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,559
it right so they have to chain it to

666
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,880
bypass that one right but sometimes you

667
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,799
can get ahead of them with a vaccine in

668
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,640
the computer to tell them well we

669
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,559
changed something so yeah

670
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,320
right so this is kind of the battle

671
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,240
describe the battle right

672
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,000
so so yeah that's a good question so

673
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,080
that that is the challenge that that i

674
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
want to do so

675
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,559
my

676
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,159
my my my objective of this work is that

677
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,640
whatever you change from whatever

678
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,720
before

679
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,360
i don't care what you change but i

680
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
can identify

681
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
your behavior and your behavior will be

682
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,440
the same then you are you

683
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
like the same it's even though you have

684
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
a different variant

685
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,640
right

686
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,520
so so i have a two different approach so

687
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,400
and two of these expresses i use the

688
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
the image processing method uh so that's

689
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
why my title is gone uh

690
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,039
image based approaches right so in the

691
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,360
first approach um

692
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,159
i connect heat from r h for more stands

693
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,960
for hybrid image transformation for

694
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
malware classification right here for

695
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,360
more so what we did is that

696
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,080
what we did is um and of course uh

697
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,120
some of you may question is not new

698
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,080
this technique is new it's new but it's

699
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,600
just a little bit new

700
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,919
people already done that like 20 years

701
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:24,880
ago

702
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,279
but why our

703
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,120
work is still valid there because we do

704
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,039
something like better

705
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,919
so so so that is resource right so we we

706
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,960
create the method that we

707
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,000
what we did is we don't care about the

708
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
the the code right we care about

709
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,080
the some of the cementite in the code so

710
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,480
what we did is we we get the binary we

711
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,399
don't have a circle slide the question i

712
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,840
asked goes like how can you get the

713
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,679
server normally my way you don't have a

714
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,880
circle right this is just excusable fine

715
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,799
so what we did is we

716
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,919
we combined the different image

717
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,000
transformation method

718
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
and then

719
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,679
we just get that we combine

720
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,679
the method we just get the binary and

721
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,320
then we combine that we transform that

722
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,000
into the image

723
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,399
and we elaborate that image to the

724
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
machine learning world so in the machine

725
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,440
learning

726
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
you may know that the machine learning

727
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,640
or ai is recovered recently because they

728
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,279
started with the image processing right

729
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,840
so for example how google recognize your

730
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,919
cad something like you may know about

731
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,919
that right so we leverage that so we

732
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,399
capture the feature of the malware

733
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,200
by

734
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,440
highlighting some of the important

735
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
session

736
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,919
in the image

737
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,600
so that whenever you chain

738
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,840
the bit picture uh

739
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,000
the big picture this i mean the real bit

740
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,320
picture here is still stay the same so

741
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,399
we still can detect that right

742
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,880
so we can carry some semantic of that so

743
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
i give you some example right so so we

744
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,640
compare with with some of the the method

745
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,679
so

746
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,720
here

747
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
uh this is the picture that

748
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,320
we use um we implement this

749
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,000
so let's say in one malware sample

750
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
if you have a

751
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,679
method like this method the first method

752
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,080
that image will be generated that method

753
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
will be generated so we have different

754
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
way so this is our method here so we

755
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
you see that our method generates

756
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,799
something and

757
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,120
if you look at by human like it's it's

758
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
much different from the rest

759
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,760
so we also do comparison of this

760
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,960
accuracy of this so so our performance

761
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,600
uh like you know outperform of the rest

762
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,919
right so what we did that

763
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,720
we

764
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,039
we proved that even though we have a

765
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,919
different

766
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,399
obligation a different backing technique

767
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,080
we still capture

768
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,279
we still capture the the malware right

769
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,840
um the different malware variant also

770
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,200
capture like

771
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,760
so we yield this this way the reason for

772
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,039
that is we

773
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,159
we based on a recent study they say that

774
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,799
okay even you create different variant

775
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,039
the global picture the global structure

776
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,360
still remains the same so that's why the

777
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
picture

778
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,799
captured from that malware is still the

779
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,279
same so the machine learning model still

780
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,640
capture that

781
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,440
so that that that is the new thing in in

782
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,840
in our work right so i give you some

783
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,880
sample like for example uh if you give

784
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,440
me the deny then i use my method i

785
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,360
generate the picture like on the

786
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,200
and left hand side and the

787
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,399
malware

788
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,880
is the one in the right hand side so i

789
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,840
mean

790
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,960
in in in in the human eyes

791
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,600
you can look at like different but but

792
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
this is the method that the machine can

793
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,200
be you know detect right

794
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,360
so we we do some uh

795
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,240
uh evaluation on that we use some

796
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,039
providers here writer total like uh some

797
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,200
of you already mentioned over there and

798
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,679
we publish the code if some of you want

799
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,120
to so by the way all of our project and

800
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,000
and research we we published this we

801
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,559
didn't give secret so it's it's it's

802
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,960
there so i put on the github as well so

803
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,799
we have a lab um

804
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,679
a lot of samples so right now we have

805
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,120
about uh 20k for the sample and of

806
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,080
course we if we have more is better

807
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,240
right so um

808
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
yeah so so that is what we have and we

809
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,039
we did some experiment we compared with

810
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,399
some different method right so uh

811
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,000
so if you see here

812
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,960
the

813
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,320
the we we still uh the method i

814
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
highlight over there is our method is

815
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,120
not like too high compared with author

816
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,679
but it's the best in this

817
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,679
compared with this the one that that we

818
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,360
have right

819
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
and um yeah so

820
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,919
like scott mentioned about the

821
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,039
uh we have a lot of more work that that

822
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,240
we can do so for example the ransomware

823
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,360
maybe we can try this way right or we we

824
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,039
we can do some other uh data sets uh for

825
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,440
example how we do with mac how we do

826
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,000
with liners or just android

827
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that is a lot of a lot of other work to

828
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,880
do

829
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
right so

830
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,559
any question for this

831
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
yes

832
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
do you have a preference for which

833
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,880
database is the best

834
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,480
and the reason i asked that is because

835
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
we saw and covered

836
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,720
this um

837
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,920
[Music]

838
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,320
um

839
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,919
i um

840
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,760
that's a good question i

841
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,039
i do not have that information so i can

842
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,600
say like what we did is we just

843
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,320
uh we did a very ad hoc way so i think

844
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,640
that's a good idea so um

845
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,000
we uh

846
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,240
we have we have some sort of like scott

847
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,960
mentioned like or um

848
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,600
might also mention like vitas total

849
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,279
vital share

850
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,760
we have some of the central one but

851
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,559
uh in these they have like uh like

852
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,960
fishing uh fish fish tank or something

853
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
right so they sell all of the data they

854
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,159
have

855
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,480
right but um

856
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,960
right to have a central one i

857
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,559
in the top of my knowledge i i don't

858
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,840
know i i wish i wish we should have that

859
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,159
do you think that would be helpful

860
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,960
to be able to attack them

861
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,960
i i i think so yeah i think so so i know

862
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,320
that there is the

863
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,480
there that big data says it's called

864
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,519
cargo

865
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,000
cargo.com that is the one that they say

866
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,519
all of the data says they have but it's

867
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,919
not only malware this they have studied

868
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,360
the idea that you're talking about but

869
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
they they have a all of the data sets

870
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,199
that they put

871
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,000
right

872
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,040
sure yeah

873
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,520
yep

874
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,040
pretty

875
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,480
processor intensive that may not be

876
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,520
may not be available to

877
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,639
a larger audience or a larger user than

878
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,359
normal people not have the ability to do

879
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,320
that

880
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,520
correct yes yes so so this is with

881
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,040
machine learning so

882
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,480
i mean

883
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,960
if we look at this

884
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,880
we can compare the difference right at

885
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,200
by by by your eyes

886
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
but if you look at let's say million of

887
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,839
features like that how how can now

888
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,359
that's why the machine learning is

889
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,240
better

890
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,799
in that sense

891
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,359
because they debate so

892
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,839
i'm not the data scientist so i cannot

893
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,320
answer that question because um

894
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
so right now like

895
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,400
the more data the machine learning model

896
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,280
have

897
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,599
the better they can identify

898
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,920
and and that is as i mentioned that is

899
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,480
not my expertise like that is the

900
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,960
machine learning and ai i i'm my

901
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,240
expertise in cyber security so so my

902
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,000
my work is to

903
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,520
how to fit the more useful data to to do

904
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,119
the the model

905
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,040
but how the model detect that i have no

906
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,720
answer yeah

907
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,760
just to add to that a little bit so to

908
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,839
help answer that question was

909
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,880
is those images uh yes they're

910
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,119
intensive but a lot of the newer graphic

911
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,680
cards can spin through that pretty quick

912
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,320
right so um you if you get a newer

913
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,560
higher end processor on those like an

914
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
nvidia card or

915
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,119
one different types of video cards video

916
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,440
cards they they can handle images pretty

917
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,079
quickly uh but as far as the data set

918
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,359
goes

919
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,040
right it all comes down to the

920
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,440
classification of being able to identify

921
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,280
those images to be able to sort them

922
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,240
into whether it's benign or malware

923
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,839
right and so if you're doing it from an

924
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,359
image standpoint

925
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,160
right being able to put them help that

926
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,880
classifier see the image and understand

927
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,359
it it's just like the old ai of being

928
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,760
able to sort apples and bananas

929
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,000
right it's just another image that is

930
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,640
being used to help classify

931
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,200
and be able to categorize those types of

932
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,160
software or the images in this case so

933
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,320
the better data that you have the train

934
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,040
knows the better your results will be to

935
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,520
be able to run it through fairly quickly

936
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,119
and you can script that stuff pretty

937
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,240
easily

938
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,200
so does that help answer your question

939
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,240
okay

940
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,040
yeah thank you john yeah so so yeah that

941
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,920
is like a lot of thing to to learn about

942
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,839
including myself i uh yes

943
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,560
is basically just taking the binary

944
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,520
transforming it to create more features

945
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,720
that the

946
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,800
classifier more data yeah more data

947
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,839
fusion yes

948
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,000
so that they can learn better

949
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,119
yeah

950
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,280
yeah more

951
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,240
data no more guys not normal data but

952
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,880
it's more useful information i i would

953
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
say your more useful information yeah

954
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,320
more future yes

955
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
yeah and that helps with the

956
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,119
classification classifier right right

957
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,720
is this sample is this

958
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
is this the entire code or is this just

959
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
a piece of the code anti-code

960
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,520
anti-program that is excusable so if you

961
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,520
put that in your computer it's running

962
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
yes

963
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,520
do you mean like how many features yes

964
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,000
so um

965
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
no for this one we

966
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,640
we don't care about how many features we

967
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,359
just care like how we carry

968
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,280
the sum of the piece of the code into

969
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,320
the image

970
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,599
and all of these emails are features

971
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,320
but but my next work i have a question

972
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,800
for you for the next the next one yes in

973
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,119
the next one we have we have that answer

974
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,640
but this one we don't have we got this

975
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,200
on the image uh so we we just uh we we

976
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,920
we we have some yeah we have some of the

977
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,240
the not one but let's say the one that i

978
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,280
mentioned to

979
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
you your answer i think the question you

980
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,520
have is we

981
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,320
uh

982
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,280
yeah we we captured this like um this is

983
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,599
the question i think maybe answer uh

984
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,160
like this five session had

985
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,599
some impulse uh some entropy and some uh

986
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,440
we we do some some character-based

987
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,200
technique but we

988
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
we don't cow like okay future one future

989
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,160
two filter three no we don't count that

990
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,320
that's great well i think i think kind

991
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,800
of the question right is that uh with

992
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,280
your classifier right you have to have

993
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,200
some type of features to be able to help

994
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,079
distinguish the nine versus malware so i

995
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,599
think that is that what you're leading

996
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,480
to right so that one in in my in this

997
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,560
world it's a machine learning we we do

998
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,720
not identify what we identify is here

999
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,520
okay

1000
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
what kind of feature that we can fit

1001
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,079
into it's useful to the machine learning

1002
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,079
so we capture for example like what is

1003
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,160
the file session we transform into the

1004
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,880
image what is the header we transform in

1005
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
the image deny that

1006
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,320
right yes

1007
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,839
uh no no we we do not we do not

1008
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
that's important okay yeah that's more

1009
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,440
work to do to be done yeah

1010
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,720
okay so let's see we have 20 minutes so

1011
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,680
maybe i will talk in 10 minutes uh more

1012
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
about the next world so

1013
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,720
um

1014
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,119
yeah i think uh

1015
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,200
i hope that you get the big picture of

1016
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,680
what we are doing with this one i think

1017
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,240
with this question i believe you you you

1018
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
got the feature right so the next work

1019
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
that i want to do is i want to show you

1020
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,440
is we also use the image

1021
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,280
technique however

1022
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,240
we use differently so we um so

1023
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,319
back to the question you have like one

1024
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,440
of the feature

1025
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,200
uh we have how many pieces i don't have

1026
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,359
an exact question but in the network i

1027
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,640
have a i have a question answer for you

1028
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,800
for that right so

1029
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,319
we do even we use the image bay but we

1030
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,520
we do a little bit differently so we

1031
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,440
we want to capture

1032
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,040
the behavior instead of just like the

1033
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,200
the region of the code and we transform

1034
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,240
the image

1035
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,280
so so we conduct the image uh

1036
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,880
behavior bay

1037
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,720
uh and in this we have different

1038
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,160
datasets

1039
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,359
and back to question of

1040
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,880
what's your name

1041
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,119
karina so so this is the challenge we

1042
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,920
have in this work like how many samples

1043
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,720
we have to to do the work so this is the

1044
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
big challenge in this world because

1045
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,800
uh we do it just for java

1046
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,520
and to find the sample of java malware

1047
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,960
is is it's a little bit challenging

1048
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,000
so

1049
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,240
so we have a lot of

1050
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,520
sample we have i think we have about 40k

1051
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,480
sample

1052
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,359
but to use with our method we only

1053
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,440
filter into four four thousand four

1054
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,599
thousand sample so so i could show you

1055
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,319
that but the idea of this is also

1056
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,079
similar so

1057
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,560
uh whatever we do with that we will

1058
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,480
create the image for the machine

1059
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,599
learning

1060
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,040
but the way we create the image are

1061
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,720
different so what we did is that we will

1062
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,599
transform the java we don't have a code

1063
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,359
of java but we have a

1064
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,280
it's not binary either it's it's called

1065
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,119
by code so when we have a bar code we

1066
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,520
will we write the we not write but we

1067
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,000
yield the interpreter we transform it

1068
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,920
into the function call let's say

1069
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,319
function a confusion b con function c c

1070
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,359
naught right so we call that inter

1071
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,040
procedure

1072
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,079
function called graph and we put that

1073
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,319
into the graph to have a relationship

1074
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,920
let's say function a confusing b

1075
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
function b confusion c

1076
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,200
we and then we put these together

1077
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,240
we

1078
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,520
map it into the image

1079
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,599
so that's the first step we do so that

1080
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,599
is what we are striving is gone uh

1081
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,240
inter procedure control flow graph right

1082
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,359
so so we we extract that

1083
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,560
given that we know the behavior because

1084
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,480
behavior i mean okay you call function a

1085
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,319
you go on function b you can function c

1086
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,079
what you do like like scott mentioned

1087
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,000
about like they call this function they

1088
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,920
got that function right and the second

1089
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,240
thing we did is we add some additional

1090
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,040
feature uh that is including like

1091
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,880
the um the like for example uh some of

1092
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,760
the function that let's say the encrypt

1093
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,520
the file they delete the file or

1094
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
something like that we put that together

1095
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,400
right

1096
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,200
so

1097
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,040
um so with that we um yeah we have a the

1098
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,720
first step is that we

1099
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,960
we review the

1100
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,480
micro uh

1101
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,119
interpreter we generate the

1102
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,800
it's called the dot file this dot file

1103
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,599
mean

1104
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,720
they do that okay function a confusion b

1105
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,800
uh and function c confirms in f

1106
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,560
something like that and then we

1107
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,680
we we pull that together to have a graph

1108
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,440
right so the graph we have is something

1109
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,880
like that if you can see the feature

1110
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,280
let's say they have the main point and

1111
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
then this function called this function

1112
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,160
this confusion but with this graph it's

1113
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,680
it's very hard

1114
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,160
to generate the the image right so we do

1115
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,560
four more steps we revive this wrap into

1116
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,960
the symbols that graph like this these

1117
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,800
two graphs are equivalent

1118
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,400
you can see different but actually it's

1119
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,440
equivalent so we put this graph into the

1120
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,800
into the image

1121
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,200
so that is the image right the second

1122
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,480
one is we also extract some of the data

1123
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
some of the feature let's say what is

1124
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,160
the function there like function to

1125
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,000
encrypt the data function to download

1126
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,240
the data so we put that over there as

1127
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,440
well

1128
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,640
so so at the end we use machine learning

1129
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,400
as i mentioned we have

1130
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,280
4 thousand sample only for this one

1131
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,760
we also publish the data set

1132
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,599
and we do a lot of

1133
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,599
uh and we compare with different

1134
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,480
baseline we compare at least two

1135
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,400
uh the same data sets for different

1136
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,880
methods and if you can see over there

1137
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,839
our method is almost like 100 over there

1138
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,680
like a

1139
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,800
98

1140
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,720
compared with the

1141
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,200
previous school is like 91 or something

1142
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,319
this work is much better right

1143
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,560
so um

1144
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,599
yeah so um

1145
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,599
that is two uh

1146
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,800
two different uh work but we use the

1147
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,359
image processing method to detect the

1148
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,560
malware so

1149
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,000
um i mean it's still the prototype it's

1150
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
not like we can do it at a

1151
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,160
software that we can detect but i mean

1152
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,680
that is

1153
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,000
the good you know starting point and we

1154
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,760
want to do it further

1155
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,000
any question before i move to

1156
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,160
the next

1157
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,920
yes so so that that is the machine

1158
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,359
learning question

1159
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,920
yeah so in um uh in our experiment we

1160
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,119
just do like uh like the single load is

1161
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,319
mean that we

1162
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,680
uh we just um we just do it one time as

1163
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,079
we have a double load we this is a deep

1164
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,240
learning technique that they they have a

1165
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
many layer so layer one they tend to

1166
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,480
layer two and then they put the layer

1167
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,880
three something that the more layered

1168
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,599
is the the better accuracy yeah so that

1169
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,520
is the deep learning techniques

1170
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,520
right

1171
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,079
any

1172
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,640
other question

1173
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,000
so um so then i will talk a little bit

1174
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,880
about

1175
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,319
what i'm doing now and my future group

1176
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,599
and i

1177
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,359
sit for the collaboration

1178
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,160
from you as well so

1179
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,879
as i mentioned

1180
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,160
uh this is my recent work but it's not

1181
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,800
my work that i do

1182
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,119
like for my expertise right machine

1183
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,599
learning is not my expertise so i try to

1184
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,280
learn that as well

1185
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,680
so my research

1186
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,880
for the last about you can say 20 years

1187
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,760
were

1188
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,200
web security

1189
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,040
web security

1190
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,960
so my main

1191
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,160
research objective for the next 10 years

1192
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,399
is

1193
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,440
so when you click on the link

1194
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,359
right now we talk about click on the

1195
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,440
link right so right now there is some

1196
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,119
trend i said hey don't click on that

1197
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,520
link don't click on dustling this link

1198
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,040
is dangerous

1199
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,079
that too right but how can you prevent

1200
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,960
people to click on link

1201
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,920
do you have any solution

1202
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,000
yeah right no it looks like no way right

1203
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,040
so

1204
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,559
my

1205
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,960
research objective for the next 10 year

1206
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,599
or maybe 20 years is okay i don't care

1207
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,280
whether you click on the link but i have

1208
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,839
a mechanism to say that okay

1209
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,280
this line is dangerous this line is okay

1210
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,680
so so i mean i

1211
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,800
if you ask me that work i have no answer

1212
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,559
for now that's my

1213
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,800
my goals there are some cool

1214
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,400
websites that will tell you if those

1215
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,640
links are valid or not too where they're

1216
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,079
malicious

1217
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,559
yeah google had that like google say

1218
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,200
browsing they had that but the problem

1219
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,880
here is

1220
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,440
they cannot capture all so

1221
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,760
the thing that i i i'm interested in is

1222
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,880
that

1223
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,960
google say browsing they cannot capture

1224
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,000
we can work together

1225
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,040
but i can give you example that i what i

1226
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,680
interested in and i i don't see the good

1227
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,960
solution

1228
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,920
so

1229
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,960
i i i think that like everyone here

1230
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,839
experience let's say

1231
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,280
matt and i use linkedin a lot right

1232
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,760
i don't see any of you maybe not use

1233
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,960
google

1234
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,800
so you search something on google and

1235
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,839
then you go to linkedin or you go to

1236
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,280
facebook you see the advertisement even

1237
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,160
though maybe you use different computer

1238
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,960
did you experience that

1239
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,559
right

1240
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,760
these are

1241
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,599
legitimate

1242
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,280
there's not no malicious but who knows

1243
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,599
that they steal your information

1244
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,880
so my objective is not just only

1245
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,280
detect some kind of like drive by

1246
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,400
download or something i i want to

1247
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,040
protect the internet user

1248
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,800
from you know a couple of different

1249
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,280
things so so that is my my long-term

1250
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,920
goal it's not just like the

1251
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,800
uh

1252
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,119
the the malicious website that's still

1253
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,119
your information but also i want to

1254
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,400
consider about

1255
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,559
the privacy and

1256
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,839
like

1257
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,280
so so so just for an overview here that

1258
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,119
i want that for example

1259
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,960
when you go to any website you some of

1260
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,359
the website they asked you to

1261
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,960
click on the

1262
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,440
iscon agreement right so you agree that

1263
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,359
you agree that we have this policy you

1264
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,119
have that policy

1265
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,720
so

1266
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,960
the challenge there is

1267
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,119
when they have that policy for example

1268
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,920
we do not steal your cookie we do not uh

1269
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,319
say your information

1270
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,640
but who know that they they

1271
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,359
who wanted that they

1272
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,000
they they they do whatever they

1273
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,040
they drive

1274
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,440
right so my my research goal is

1275
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,760
to to ensure that like we we have some

1276
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,520
way to control this kind of behavior in

1277
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,720
the next future right so that one is the

1278
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,960
long-term

1279
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,119
long-term goals but but the work that i

1280
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,760
show in here is the work that one of my

1281
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,319
master children did and he he joined me

1282
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:49,440
online

1283
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,640
on i think he's in california right now

1284
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,000
so um so i just want to show you one of

1285
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,760
the steps that i i go in this way it's

1286
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,319
how to do the detection from malicious

1287
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,440
uh webpage right so we we just jump into

1288
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,160
one step over there so what we did is

1289
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,880
like and the thesis uh published uh last

1290
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,720
year uh

1291
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,610
during the coffee

1292
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,880
[Music]

1293
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,640
so what we we did there is we tried to

1294
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,160
do something different what people are

1295
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,559
doing like google

1296
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,880
they they have a set of the url so we we

1297
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,800
do something different so what we try to

1298
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,240
do is we try to combine

1299
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,280
the two work that i showed you earlier

1300
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,119
the first one is status i mean i don't

1301
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,440
care what you are doing i care some of

1302
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,599
the data in in the sample and then i put

1303
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,800
that

1304
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,520
the red the second work i did i i tried

1305
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,760
to have a function call so it's mean

1306
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,160
that the behavior so in this work i

1307
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,680
tried to do like

1308
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,040
both together all together to to do that

1309
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,200
so so we do start it analysis and we do

1310
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,960
the dynamic analysis and then we have

1311
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,760
some

1312
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,400
uh feature over there so that we can we

1313
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,000
can do the

1314
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,680
the detection right

1315
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,160
so um

1316
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,359
the work that my student um praveen he

1317
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,440
is doing is uh

1318
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,359
mostly he

1319
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,960
started analyze uh that they

1320
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,640
they put the

1321
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,440
the the code so the difference between

1322
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,599
uh the work that i showed you earlier

1323
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,280
that in the web

1324
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,160
it's different because in the web

1325
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,520
the circles

1326
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,880
is available

1327
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,400
right because if you do not have a

1328
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,240
source code then the web browser cannot

1329
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,319
run the code right so that's different

1330
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,400
so that's why we can do using the

1331
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,559
abstract syntax tree here we can analyze

1332
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,520
that into the tree so we can capture

1333
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,559
some of feature because anything you do

1334
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,880
you need to convert that into the tree

1335
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,040
before you can execute it right so that

1336
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,880
that is one

1337
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,319
the second

1338
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,240
one we do is that we do the dynamic

1339
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,119
analysis so dynamic analysis what we did

1340
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,960
is we we we have a prototype earlier

1341
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,839
that we developed a browser extension

1342
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,559
so this is my my long-term long-term

1343
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,520
goal so if we can monitor what the

1344
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,280
website are doing

1345
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,920
and we can have some

1346
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,720
pattern behavior pattern so which one is

1347
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,440
bad so we can do some machine learning

1348
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,400
over there

1349
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,359
but

1350
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,760
we are not there yet we still working on

1351
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,880
that right so so what we try to do here

1352
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,119
is we extract some of the behavior

1353
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,800
feature so that we can fit to the

1354
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,920
machine learning to to to do that so so

1355
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,880
we we combined up two together right

1356
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,720
so right now we're still stuck on the

1357
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,040
machine learning uh the data set

1358
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,559
again the data says

1359
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,839
and and the how we do that right

1360
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,200
so um

1361
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,920
so we we did uh with um

1362
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,480
studies analysis yes we we have a sample

1363
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,520
of 20 22k sample but when we run the

1364
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,040
the dynamite it's meant that we have to

1365
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,880
run that in the browser so that we can

1366
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,079
extract so

1367
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,720
um a funny thing that is when my student

1368
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,920
did that

1369
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,280
there is the email from nsa

1370
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,040
sent to the university

1371
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,480
i teach hey your network is compromised

1372
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,280
and they identify my lab from my lab and

1373
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,240
say

1374
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,720
so hey set it down

1375
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,520
so what they did is they

1376
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,359
they unplugged the

1377
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,200
uh the cable

1378
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,599
and then next day my student didn't know

1379
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,520
that hey why it's not connected to the

1380
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,480
internet and in nfi is not in that uh uh

1381
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,200
what is the outlet he blew he plugged

1382
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,480
back to that

1383
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,880
so i have a big problem with that

1384
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,400
so

1385
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,760
so so so right now i um yeah i

1386
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,280
i cannot do that

1387
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,160
within ud network for now uh

1388
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,280
so um i mean i still so um yeah i have a

1389
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,480
one i i think he's here um

1390
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,839
i want to hire one you know

1391
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,319
uh research here to collaborate with me

1392
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,079
on on this as well and i mean if you

1393
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,960
guys

1394
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,000
want to

1395
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
uh collaborate with me

1396
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,680
you know we have a lot of opportunity

1397
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,119
here

1398
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,640
yes

1399
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,400
i see your accuracy

1400
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,240
decision tree the random forest so the

1401
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,359
highest

1402
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:26,160
what's the relative cost

1403
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,000
we uh yeah that's a good question we

1404
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,640
didn't have a lot of experiment on that

1405
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,839
yet

1406
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,359
but but uh

1407
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,599
uh yeah i i think we need more

1408
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,400
experiment on that however

1409
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,599
the accuracy here is based on just the

1410
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,040
statist one

1411
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,440
so we don't know whether it's good or

1412
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,680
not we need to have more sample for the

1413
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,640
dynamic one so that is my my long-term

1414
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,880
objective because i do believe that

1415
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,520
started analysis cannot so and cannot

1416
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,960
learn the the the feature because

1417
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,079
the scientist will not show the behavior

1418
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,040
my my my my my understanding that the

1419
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,839
behavior can give you better

1420
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,160
uh to itself but we still we still stuck

1421
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,440
here

1422
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,440
we still don't care so so we're working

1423
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,240
on that right

1424
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,960
right right

1425
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,280
so so as i say this is just first step

1426
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,079
but my long term step is not just do

1427
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,359
this one i i want to have something

1428
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,799
integrated in the browser so if

1429
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,040
there is some behavior that the browser

1430
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,359
detect using the model that i have they

1431
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,680
can help the user right away

1432
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,680
so

1433
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,440
i so um yes yes i i have another

1434
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,400
i have another master thesis uh and they

1435
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,880
do that so what i want to do is i want

1436
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,359
to build this into the browser

1437
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,960
not the browser extension because in

1438
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,599
browser extension it's still not

1439
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,839
it's still not have a on capability to

1440
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,400
capture all of the behavior and it's too

1441
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,480
like the question is it's a lot of

1442
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,760
overhead

1443
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,680
because like if you want to monitor

1444
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,359
function a call function bitcoin you

1445
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,599
have to hook into that and it costs a

1446
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,799
lot of time so the web will be delayed

1447
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,720
right so

1448
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,040
correct call that exactly yeah so

1449
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,119
okay so i think that

1450
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,160
this uh we have a few minutes right uh

1451
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,079
before lunch so i hope that

1452
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,400
i would not uh disappointed you

1453
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,599
yeah

1454
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,839
thanks

1455
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:41,119
um those images are really pretty cool

1456
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,880
are those available anywhere if not you

1457
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,040
should probably sell them oh we we we

1458
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,040
have now we

1459
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,640
yeah we are

1460
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,400
we publish here

1461
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,559
github

1462
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,200
yeah github uh one gin hub the other

1463
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,280
github yeah we have it

1464
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,440
we don't you do not keep it secret

1465
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,599
that is different from companies i i

1466
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,839
mean i i don't blame anything that that

1467
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,799
is the job right that is what you do but

1468
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,960
at the university normally we publish

1469
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,200
everything we we we do

1470
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,920
so so that is the difference yes so do

1471
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,280
you think you have most of your samples

1472
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,799
off of online

1473
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,040
sources do you have any checks in there

1474
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,040
for anything like keying

1475
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,920
so we do yeah that is the mention that i

1476
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
mentioned to do

1477
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,680
yeah we have that but they don't have a

1478
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,960
lot of sample in in this

1479
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,359
right they they have a yeah they they

1480
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,280
they have but they do have they do not

1481
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,799
have enough sample

1482
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,480
right to dynamic and that's where the

1483
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,599
staffing comes yeah

1484
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,839
so uh

1485
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,640
can i have a like two minutes more just

1486
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,279
advertise what we are doing more in

1487
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,319
so

1488
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,280
yeah so that is my technical stuff

1489
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,359
i'm back to

1490
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,440
nontestical stuff that the second

1491
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,839
purpose of my talk uh and

1492
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,920
i also put that in the table because we

1493
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,000
are sponsor uh

1494
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,079
sponsor of the conference uh your

1495
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,799
sponsor at john just mentioned right so

1496
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,119
i just put some slide about that so

1497
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,640
um one thing that i want to give you the

1498
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,079
message today is that um i have a

1499
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,880
another friend that she worked at uh

1500
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,559
she's doctor i think she's yeah my

1501
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,720
doctor something and she said okay i

1502
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,400
have a

1503
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,839
son he interested in cyber security

1504
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,920
but judy don't have that so we went to

1505
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,359
uc

1506
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:40,480
so

1507
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,359
i

1508
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,440
if you still think that i want to show

1509
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,880
you now we we have very strong cyber

1510
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,960
security over there so

1511
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,799
uh the message today

1512
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,480
uh logan just asked me right so i think

1513
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,400
the first question i answered to you we

1514
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,799
do not do all stuff we do state of the

1515
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,680
art we do on the edge right

1516
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,319
and the second thing is we um

1517
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,599
