44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
some of you guys might some might not

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
don't know what it is

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
anyways i thought it was kind of good so

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
um

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,040
so again oisf ohio information security

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
forum uh you know we're here to do all

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
of our cool cyber stuff and educate

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
folks um

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
you know we're here to network with all

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
of our peers trying to do some uh

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,320
training and

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
so that's another reason why we're here

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,200
today we're gonna do some training

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,399
education

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,520
um

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
to do some collaboration meet other

60
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,479
folks and try and

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
improve our skill set and our connection

62
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,920
so that way we can do better defense

63
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
or offense right

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
so that way we can tell those people

65
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,680
they need to defend their systems better

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
so

67
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
all right so

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
oh yeah i threw this in that was kind of

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,239
cool

70
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
right so if you guys remember 16 candles

71
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
right the guy hanging upside down on the

72
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,599

our focus for oisf is to educate users

76
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
trying at least to impact one person at

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
helping with getting that all set up so

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
it's it's not easy to obtain but it's a

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,639
it's a good certification to have

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,400
uh in fact

176
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
back in the day before it was called

177
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,080
cyber security or

178
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
this whole nsa thing came about uh i was

179
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
actually a recipient of the information

180
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,800
assurance scholarship program that's

181
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
what it was called back then

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,520
um

183
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
and it's now the uh

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,600
cyber security scholarship program or

185
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,080
something like that funded by nsa so

186
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
they uh nsa paid for my phd

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
and that's how i

188
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
was able to obtain that so anyways uh

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
good job for ud getting that set up in

190
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
the area so and of course glue where uh

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,479
they co-sponsored uh somebody else but

192
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,199
they

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
i guess glueware won the one won the bet

194
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,479
so

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,160
um

196
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
silver sponsors

we don't have any of those but

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,039

a lot of it but we are on it um linkedin

251
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,320
is more of our preferred venue um

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
because it's more of a professional

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
environment uh twitter has uh well of

254

286
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,200
funny um and these were just

287
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
uh things that are happening in 2022 and

288
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,320
it and you look at all these trends that

289
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
all these organizations are saying and a

290
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,160
lot of them are the same

291
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,440
right um

292
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,399
automotive hacking ai

293
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,600
mobile

294
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,880
cloud security data breaches how many

295
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,160
times have we heard that in the news

296
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
right and the list goes on and on and on

297
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,240
so uh

298
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,959
it you start hearing this broken record

299
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,240
effect and it gets frustrating sometimes

300
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,160
it's like why are we still so bad at

301
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,640
this in 2022

302
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,360
so um you know forbes their their top

303
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
five uh ransomware what a shock right

304
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,440
been hearing that for how long now um

305
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
5g well that's kind of new that's coming

306
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
up of course it's the new thing right

307
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,880
soon we'll be in 6g and 7g and whatever

308
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,519
else right online fraud

309
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,680
wow shocker there um

310
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
remote environments yeah

311
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
what happened last year the last two

312
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
years covered right everything went

313
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,519
remote so not a surprise there

314
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
gardner uh anybody know familiar with

315
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
gartner and their their stuff right and

316
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
their quadrants and stuff like that so

317
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
their top trends for 2022 uh expanding

318
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,360
the uh uh tax surface well yeah because

319
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
we're connecting more things that would

320
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,480
make sense right digital or supply chain

321
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,079
uh i'm gonna harp on that one for a

322
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
minute but not right this second

323
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,600
supply chain just keep that in mind

324
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
because you hear that a lot too

325
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
um cyber security mesh i thought that

326
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,560
was kind of interesting but it's been

327
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,839
around for a while

328
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,160
so um they're just finding different

329
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
ways to

330
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
distribute and share the security cyber

331
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,079
security workload of the workforce so

332
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,440
they're using different venues and

333
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
avenues and sensors to help do the cyber

334
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
security and distributed decisions right

335
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
so that way everything's not centrally

336
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
located

337
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,200
and you're distributing out some of that

338
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
stuff

339
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
all right trend micro another one right

340
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
cyber cyber criminals in the cloud right

341
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
they're starting to use uh amazon web

342
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
services virtual services uh to build

343
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
their machines and stuff like that and

344
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
do their attacks so it helps cover their

345
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
tracks and stuff like that so

346
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,360
um

347
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
wait what's that second one supply chain

348
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
attacks wow they said that too huh

349
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
zero day vulnerabilities we've been

350
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
hearing that for a long time uh oh

351
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,959
here's another one connected car wait

352
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,240
that's again another tr repeating trend

353
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,200
right so uh it's just you know this is

354
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,920
from the uk the verdict right and what's

355
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,079
that second one supply chain

356
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
again why why are we having so many

357
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,680
issues with the supply chain is it

358
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
because people are

359
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,040
you know it's the great resignation is

360
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
what they're calling it from covert

361
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,079
right people are have moved on and they

362
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,320
want to find new jobs

363
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
so the people that were working in the

364
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
factories they're like i want a better

365
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
job i want to work from home well you

366
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,680
can't build those things from home

367
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,959
so

368
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
the one i found interesting was the

369
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
bottom one cyber skills uh shortage

370
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,959
that's been

371
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
an issue since way back when right still

372
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
trying to get folks up to speed on cyber

373
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,800
security it's amazing when i go out to

374
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
do and assessments and pen testing

375
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
engagements and stuff like that

376
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
i've talked to other folks of

377
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,639
uh the things that are not still

378
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,200
happening or that should be happening in

379
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
the ia cyber security field because

380
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
they don't have uh the skills

381
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,839
so and now

382
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,920
getting more restricted because they

383
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
don't want to share

384
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,199
uh there was a period of time where

385
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,560
things started to open up a little bit

386
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
more

387
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,639
for

388
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,120
like how to pen test

389
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
and now some of that's and how to do

390
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,199
malware and reverse engineering some of

391
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,040
that's kind of going back into closed

392
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,440
channels and behind doors and and some

393
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
of the knowledge isn't being shared

394
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,440
or they're being sanctioned

395
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
because of stuff they're doing

396
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
right and so they're open source uh

397
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,160
things are being blocked to certain uh

398
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,639
countries and and venues because of the

399
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,240
the knowledge out of that and they're

400
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,399
not allowing some of that to be shared

401
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
so that's going to be a frustrating next

402
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
couple years with that so

403
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,720
um all right so

404
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,399
that was just kind of brief real quick

405
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
uh intro uh cyber security is always

406
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,399
going to be a challenge we need more

407
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,399
people bring your friends get them

408
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,720
educated so we can all do this uh and

409
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
and keep people from hacking our stuff

410
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
so

411
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,519
our disclaimer there's gonna be a couple

412
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,839
presentations we do this every month uh

413
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
you know we have people that teach

414
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
pen testing and reverse engineering and

415
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
stuff like that you try and do that out

416
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
in the real world and you get caught uh

417
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
well i would say don't call me but

418
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
actually i want to know first so i can

419
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,639
laugh or find out hey that's pretty cool

420
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,000
sorry you got caught but we can't bail

421
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
you out so um

422
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
so don't do that uh get it in writing if

423
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
you're doing a pen test engagement so

424
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,079
that way you have your get out of jail

425
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,360
free card

426
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
and you don't get uh and if you do get

427
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
caught you can say oh yeah i had

428
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
authority to do so so

429
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,360
all right so today's agenda

430
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
got a good lineup right matt's gonna

431
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,360
come down here on how to become an ir

432
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
superstar uh scott's gonna talk about uh

433
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
ransomware that is not the problem

434
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,279
right and i would agree with that so i

435
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,399
mean because it shouldn't be getting it

436
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,079
in the first place right

437
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,320
so uh and then foo's going to come up

438
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
hybrid image base uh approaches the

439
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,079
malware

440
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,880
mike is going to kick off after lunch

441
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
on how to how his 1993 ccg prepared him

442
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,959
to be

443
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
in the infosec world so that should be

444
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
pretty interesting and jared is going to

445
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,440
do

446
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
cyber security and the quantum age so i

447
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,639
don't know if people have been hearing

448
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
about quantum age and quantum computing

449
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
and all that kind of stuff so they're

450
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
using that uh in fact nist had an

451
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
announcement the other day about uh

452
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,959
there were certain uh

453
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,600
crypto algorithms that are not uh

454
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
cracked by

455
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,160
um

456
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
quantum computing so

457
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,399
uh we're gonna take a break uh do a cake

458
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
cutting ceremony uh and then daryl's

459
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
gonna wrap it up with his enterprise lt

460
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,800
deployment uh i'm not gonna spoil that

461
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
but it's a big time vendor that they did

462
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,440
some pen testing engagement and iot work

463
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,639
and should be pretty interesting so

464
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,519
all right

465
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,800
uh oh speaking of supply chains right

466
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,199
um i mentioned that three times in those

467
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,440
five and there's many more subjects

468
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,199
about that right so

469
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,440
yeah look at this i want to go order the

470
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,480
cake this is what i get

471
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,079
so

472
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
no cake for you no i'm just kidding uh

473
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,519
we do have a cake uh but the problem was

474
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
uh when i went to order they like yeah

475
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,839
we can order it it'll take till next

476
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,399
week to get it in and we're completely

477
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
out of chocolate cake

478
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,759
so all i have is vanilla

479
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,399
so but we do have a cake so

480
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,240
bret not

481
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
but uh yeah we'll see what we can do

482
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,439
uh it was uh yeah trying to get uh

483
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,319
supplies and stuff like that in

484
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
it's quite quite a challenge so all

485
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,280
right so we're gonna bring uh matt in uh

486
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
to do his uh his thing

487
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,760
and then uh to kick this off so

488
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,280
let me get this one going
