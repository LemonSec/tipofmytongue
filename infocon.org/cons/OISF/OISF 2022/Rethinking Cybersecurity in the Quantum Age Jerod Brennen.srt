1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,520
i will go ahead and get started on the

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
next one testing topics oh thanks yeah

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,200
i hope you enjoyed it it's fun fun topic

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,519
i'm with you on that clicker thank you

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,040
sir left right front backwards

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,400
so all right so uh we're gonna go ahead

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,880
and get started so jared so this you

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
know this morning we've had a couple

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,519
presenters come up from cincinnati

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,240
uh we had one uh daryl's gonna wrap it

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
up for us from the local dayton area but

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
uh we decided to go a little bit east

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,079
and uh we got one in from columbus so uh

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,160
one great thing about dayton is uh you

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,399
know kind of centrally located between

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,559
columbus and cincinnati where there's a

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,000
lot of cyber security work and the

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,480
larger organizations going on so

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,879
we kind of have that reach out to both

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,079
areas and able to bring some of this

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,280
different speakers in from those

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,199
different areas of uh

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,800
you know work and type of environment

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,519
foreign

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
we're not just centrally locked in with

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,400
most of the bait

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,119
means we're able to get to that that

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,880
answer a lot more quickly than we were

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,840
today

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
now quantum computing

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
is not going to eliminate

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
make that game any better it's actually

33
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,840
going to be

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
yes

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
enjoyable experience right when we look

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
at um

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
large data sets and we look at churning

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
through those data sets to come up with

39
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,878
meaningful information that is a

40
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,680
clear-cut practical use case for quantum

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
and so that's an important takeaway it's

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,040
not that we're going to have one or the

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
other we're going to have both and so

44
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,800
they're going to be some things we do in

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
cyber security traditional models that

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
still apply but there are going to be

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
some things that shift and change based

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
on where organizations start using these

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
other um

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,760
i don't even know what i'm pushing now

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
there we go

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
um pushing these other models so as an

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
example and this is from

54
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,120
microsoft talking about um quantum

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
hardware you've got no apps

56
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
your classical compute stuff on the top

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
and then what um

58
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
one of the the more common ways that

59
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
we're able to

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
observe these qubits

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
is we've got to slow them down enough so

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
that we can actually take a look

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,319
and by slowing them down and they're you

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,040
know

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
flying around the uh the atoms we uh um

66
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,879
we're using cryogenics

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,760
to just make things really really cold

68
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,200
um now i don't know if you've looked

69
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
into cryogenics at all it's a little

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
more complicated than fry and futurama

71
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
just tripping into the the container uh

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,440
it's expensive and it's big and it's um

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,319
it's one of the reasons that quantum is

74
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
limited today

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
that it hasn't exploded because just a

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,519
matter of scale

77
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159
there has been some innovation where

78
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,840
uh one group was able to use magnets

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
to slow down these qubits to observe

80
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
them

81
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
instead of of cryogenics and those

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,159
magnets

83
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,640
are less expensive less

84
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
cumbersome smaller

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,040
um but the way it happens right we we do

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
our compute on top but we're passing

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
stuff down to the lower layer and then

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,280
we bring it back up for the uh

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
the good stuff

90
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,799
i think i'm pushing the wrong button the

91
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,760
whole time

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,840
um oh and i talked about the the magnets

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
because um they are less expensive but

94
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,519
then the whole one of the whole

95
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,000
challenges with quantum is uh as soon as

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,439
we observe it we change it right it's uh

97
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,279
this is stuff that fascinates me that i

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
still don't have my head around but i

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,478
would just say there are people a hell

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
of a lot smarter than me who have been

101
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
doing this stuff for years and have a

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
good idea of what do we need to do next

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
to make this stuff better and faster and

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
more accessible

105
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
when i say years

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,320
this chart from devapedia.org traces

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,160
quantum computing all the way back to

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,000
1935.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,880
although

110
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,919
the items in uh white are some of the

111
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
bigger ticket items and the ones i

112
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,160
wanted to mention um in 1980

113
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
where we had been looking at mechanical

114
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,520
computers we were looking at the turing

115
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,880
machine for anybody who's seen um what

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,840
was the uh the movie was it an enigma

117
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,039
effect

118
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,039
with uh benedict cumberbatch is alan

119
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,320
turing

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,000
right uh fantastic uh fantastic story

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
um

122
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
what is it

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
thank you thank you um and so we we took

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
this idea of mechanical computing to

125
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,000
digital computing but then when we we

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
got to 1980 there's this conference and

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
they start talking about computation

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
uh as physics

129
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
which is where this idea of what else

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,080
can we observe

131
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,280
uh

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,639
how can we use that for uh computing

133
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,400
um and then in 1982

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,080
we had a

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,759
topology sorry

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,560
um topological quantum order

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,840
um

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,880
which is again beyond me 1985 um the the

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,880
idea of the universal quantum computer

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,919
which is like taking that that um

141
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,800
turing computational model and saying

142
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,319
well what would it look like if we did

143
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,880
it with physics components in using

144
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,160
qubits and then in

145
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,960
92

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,759
uh

147
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,000
somebody dropped this the first quantum

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
algorithm where they say well here's an

149
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
example of once we understand how to

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
make this technology work here's an

151
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,479
algorithm we can apply to actually do

152
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
these computations and then 94 was like

153
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
the the tipping point

154
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,680
shores factoring algorithm

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
it's it's it's math i'll leave it at

156
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
that but it makes this uh more real

157
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,479
and so from there things start to pick

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,280
up and accelerate um i'll get into error

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,800
correction a little later because that's

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
one of the the tripping points right now

161
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
but as we roll into

162
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,000
2015 2016 which is when ibm

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,599
first made quantum computing available

164
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,360
in their cloud and we're seeing more and

165
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,960
more folks it's 2022.

166
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
six years ago

167
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
ibm made this available in their their

168
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
cloud environment

169
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,440
this is not science fiction

170
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
this has been accessible for years and

171
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,520
if i go back to like

172
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,319
and start there how many of you

173
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
you don't mind shelf hands uh were alive

174
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,039
in 1980.

175
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,880
all of these changes have happened in

176
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
your lifetime

177
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,919
let that sink in for a minute we went

178
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,960
from this idea of could we do this

179
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
to making it a commercially available

180
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120
solution that people have been using for

181
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
years

182
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
before the group of us got together

183
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,360
today to talk about it

184
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
that's how quickly it's been moving and

185
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
it's not slowing down

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
when we look at what's coming next

187
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,599
um

188
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,879
in our

189
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
space

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,599
post quantum cryptography is all the jam

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
that's the big scary that we need to

192
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,720
talk about

193
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,680
but i also want to point out from a

194
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
a business case

195
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
financial services really starting to

196
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
use quantum these are projections

197
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
um from futuretimeline.net looking ahead

198
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,520
2023 28 and 38

199
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
there are

200
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
businesses who are financially motivated

201
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,400
to invest in this technology and now

202
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
that it's accessible and they're able to

203
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
start seeing games seeing profits

204
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
they're going to invest more money in

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,319
the technology that's the nature of a

206
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,039
capitalist economic system i can make

207
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,240
more money i'm going to invest more

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,919
money make more money invest more money

209
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,200
in our world this notion of how do we

210
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
keep the secret secret

211
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,000
that's post-quantum cryptography because

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
all the crypto that we have today sorry

213
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,920
not nft

214
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,880
crypto bro crypto um all of the

215
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
cryptography that we have today that

216
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,600
protects data at rest data emotion data

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
and memory

218
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
um it will break

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,279
uh when when this

220
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
ends up in the hands when quantum

221
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
technology ends up in the hands of

222
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,399
people that

223
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
we would rather it didn't end up in

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,160
their hands mckenzie and company

225
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
published some research and they said

226
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
industries like finance may begin to

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,959
realize gains from quantum computing by

228
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,320
2025 that's a few years away and this is

229
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,080
another important takeaway

230
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
realized gains

231
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,519
means that's when they start to see that

232
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,240
profit so that's three years

233
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
three years from when they start to see

234
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
the return on their investment

235
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
that they are making today it's not that

236
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,800
they're going to start using it some of

237
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
the folks here in this room may work for

238
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
organizations who are leveraging this

239
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
technology in one way or another

240
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,279
and

241
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,000
i also saw that there's um

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,640
a couple of articles from ibm

243
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,959
they're an estimated two thousand to

244
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,279
five thousand quantum computers that

245
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,360
we'll see globally available by 2030

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
with uh

247
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
mass adoption

248
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,440
by 2035. 2030 is eight years away

249
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
and we're talking a high-end estimate

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
5000 quantum computers available

251
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,040
globally not all of those computers will

252
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,839
be used by trusted individuals some of

253
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
those computers will be used by threat

254
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
actors to target

255
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,279
organizations like the ones we're trying

256
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,760
to protect

257
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,880
oh gotcha

258
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
if you want to adjust the resolution to

259
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
try that because

260
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,959
fingers crossed

261
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,279
coming back

262
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,890
[Laughter]

263
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,360
all right while we are adjusting

264
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,120
any questions about what i've shared so

265
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,399
far

266
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,000
nobody's left so i haven't scared

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
anybody too bad and that's good i'm not

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
trying to scare people away i'm just

269
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,200
trying to give people perspective that

270
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,440
perspective yes sir helps us do our jobs

271
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,680
yes

272
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
didn't see any mention of richard

273
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
feynman

274
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,600
you guys are one step ahead of me and

275
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
what help me out who's richard feynman

276
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,760
i'm gonna

277
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
do my own research and update my

278
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
presentation before i share it again i

279
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
appreciate that

280
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,640
he's the first one that came up with a

281
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
mathematical

282
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
model for

283
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,480
uh making a quantum computer and seth

284
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
lloyd from mit

285
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
made the first

286
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
quantum computing component using

287
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
chemicals too

288
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
i yeah you and i need to catch up after

289
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
i need to add like a hall of fame slide

290
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,279
to this to really call out some of these

291
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
folks

292
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,639
i noticed in the book

293
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,720
you referenced arthur clark and steven

294
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,160
baxter i recognized baxter's name

295
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
i recognize baxter's name here's the

296
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
manifold series

297
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,240
manifold time and manifold space okay

298
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
manifold series

299
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
uh

300
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,320
take that as a recommend i'm always

301
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,839
looking to something to add to my list

302
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,079
lester thank you was there another uh

303
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,480
another question yeah i wonder if you

304
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,560
could help this out with for me

305
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,959
i mean i know there's a difference

306
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
but there seems to be a very fine line

307
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,320
between high performance computing

308
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
resources and quantum

309
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
computing resources would you say that's

310
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,560
true and if it is true

311
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,120
what is that connection so is there a

312
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
connection between

313
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
high performance computing resources and

314
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,920
quantum um

315
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,279
[Music]

316
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,560
right

317
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
or not or is or what is that

318
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,160
yeah

319
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,320
this is a this is a good question and

320
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
and i want to

321
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,839
present it in another way

322
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,480
um and i i can't speak to to that um

323
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
like high performance getting into the

324
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,920
details of what's in scope outoscope

325
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,399
there but when i hear the term i think

326
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,959
of the terms malware and ransomware as

327
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,240
an analogy

328
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,040
right all ransomware is malware but not

329
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
all malware is ransomware

330
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,040
right i can have this entire body of of

331
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,600
stuff like malware and then ransomware

332
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
will be a subset of that what i would

333
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,880
think if if

334
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,240
and i'm just

335
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,480
hypothesizing here when we look at the

336
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,160
idea of high performance computing is

337
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,199
that where you are

338
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
uh yeah yeah good to go thank you

339
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
that as quantum becomes more or quantum

340
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,240
computing becomes more and more

341
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,839
accessible and available

342
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,560
it it's likely to still be categorized

343
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,519
in that

344
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
high performance computing but you you

345
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
might still have digital computing

346
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
that's also high performance but

347
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,920
um i don't know if anybody has another

348
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,399
uh opinion perspective to offer up on

349
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
that that's yeah

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,519
there is one more algorithm called

351
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,760
growers algorithm which was uh started

352
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,519
in 1996

353
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,160
so where the non-steps database is easy

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,519
to find

355
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,600
in any data so it's called grover's

356
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,120
algorithm that is like

357
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,560
i'll have to look into that one um yeah

358
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,120
what what i am going to ask for the the

359
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
the row here right or the column

360
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
um if you are on linkedin please send me

361
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,399
a note with these notes uh if you're not

362
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
uh protonmail i can get you my proton

363
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,959
mail i've got uh i've got one yes sir

364
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,959
the difference that

365
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,120
until like the last two years quantum

366
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
was more very specialized

367
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
in the sense that it can only do certain

368
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,399
things

369
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,720
it wasn't really you couldn't like write

370
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
a standard program to do just anything

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,240
quantum bits were really made to do

372
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,839
certain types of calculations

373
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,880
okay as they've changed over the last

374
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
couple of years they're starting to get

375
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,760
into that

376
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
like you said touring kind of mindset

377
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
where they now are becoming processors

378
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,480
got it i think that's the difference

379
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,880
between like a super computer

380
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
is until recently they were doing

381
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,079
different things

382
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,120
but

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
it's trying to change i mean we now just

384
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
have one that's now a thousand times

385
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,759
faster

386
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,600
and now we're starting to do analogs

387
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,399
that they're starting to compete with

388
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
that's the same crap interesting

389
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,680
interesting and for folks um on the

390
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,959
the remote

391
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
uh i'll do my best to share what i can

392
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
with what because i know you can't hear

393
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,279
everybody in the room

394
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
i know you guys know

395
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,079
jaspen

396
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,360
they

397
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
have a big investment on this already

398
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
i know that because they're still a very

399
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
high level

400
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
scientist

401
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,519
so we're hearing some stories about some

402
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,399
uh poaching quantum experts from one

403
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,079
company to another to

404
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,759
follow the money folks it's it's really

405
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
going to drive what what happens um in

406
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
this space

407
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,959
um

408
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,399
so uh one one other uh stat i picked up

409
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
the worldwide uh market for quantum

410
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,560
computing is predicted

411
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,199
to be more than 10 billion dollars with

412
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,000
a b by 2024

413
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
and 65 billion dollars by 2030.

414
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,320
and i know

415
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,399
highly technical crowd here it's

416
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,240
important to take these numbers and keep

417
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,800
them in your hip pocket because as we

418
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
hit these milestones

419
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,560
that's when the changes are going to

420
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,399
come into the organization

421
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,560
where suddenly we're investing in these

422
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
technologies and we expect the people

423
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
working in the organizations to have

424
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,439
that that knowledge

425
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
how many folks ran this on your home

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
computers

427
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
if you ran it in a data center don't

428
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,919
admit to it in front of anybody

429
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
right seti at home

430
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,559
i i share this as uh you know looking

431
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,959
back to look ahead

432
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
um so setting at home for folks who

433
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,640
aren't familiar with the project

434
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
pointing radio telescopes out into space

435
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,000
listening

436
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and then bringing back large sets of

437
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,559
data and saying boy now we just got to

438
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,160
go through all this data and look for

439
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
aliens

440
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
um turns out the folks running the

441
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
project didn't have enough computers or

442
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
compute power

443
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
to go through all that data in a timely

444
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,559
fashion so they crowdsourced it they

445
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
just put it out on the internet and said

446
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
hey do you want to help us look for

447
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
aliens if so

448
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
run this program on your computer and it

449
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,720
can run in the background it can run in

450
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
the foreground there have been a couple

451
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,120
of assist admins who lost their jobs by

452
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,880
trying to support this project by

453
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
installing it without permission on all

454
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,320
the

455
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
servers in their data center but this

456
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,840
notion of

457
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
i'm going to take a lot of data and find

458
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
a more clever way to go through it

459
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,200
really hit me here

460
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
but as somebody who

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,679
has an unfortunate

462
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,919
family history of of cancer i've seen

463
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,240
more people uh pass

464
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,600
there are good things

465
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
from this technology it's it's one thing

466
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,880
to look at

467
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,960
uh you know let's look for aliens right

468
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,120
that's neat that's and i dig it i really

469
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,880
dig it we can change and save lives when

470
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,799
we take this technology

471
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
and apply it in a way like let's get

472
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,400
clever about

473
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,039
looking through very large data sets

474
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,880
quantum computing

475
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,440
opens this up right this is a great use

476
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
case and i offer this up because when we

477
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,480
talk about quantum in cyber security um

478
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,720
it's easy to think man this is going to

479
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
break

480
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,679
all the confidentiality stuff that we've

481
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,760
got in place today right if we can't

482
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
rely on encryption then

483
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,919
i i just had an executive at a company i

484
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,000
support asked me this yesterday on a

485
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
call because i before we got into the

486
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
call i was talking about coming out here

487
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,200
today and talking about this and he said

488
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,559
yeah i heard about that

489
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,559
doesn't that mean that cyber security is

490
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,400
just not going to work anymore

491
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
and i had to say well

492
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,320
it's it's going to change how we do some

493
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,200
things

494
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
um

495
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,799
but it's important while we're

496
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,760
working on ways to secure

497
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,360
technology while these changes are

498
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
coming that we don't resist or fight

499
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,760
against this change i i and that's a

500
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,720
personal uh stance that i take that if

501
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
you can recognize the benefits of this

502
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,000
then figuring out how to enable people

503
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
to do this securely

504
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
saves lives it has a big big impact

505
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,760
so getting into the specifics of how

506
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,480
does it impact us cryptography relies on

507
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,520
random number generation we we count on

508
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,159
uh whether it's hash generation or you

509
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,000
know whether it's very strong encryption

510
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,960
keys

511
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
that when uh when we create

512
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
um

513
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
data sets and and then we're protecting

514
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
them by encrypting them that somebody

515
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
else can't just guess

516
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,640
that very large random number right it's

517
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
it we're counting on the fact that it's

518
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,039
too complex for them to be able to get

519
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,240
to the same data that we just protected

520
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,600
pki

521
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
also relies on secure key exchange

522
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,200
mechanisms

523
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,559
and that's an important

524
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,640
one to call out we're not just trying to

525
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
protect the encryption and encryption

526
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
but we're trying to protect the keys

527
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
that we're using to encrypt and decrypt

528
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
and we've got to share them with people

529
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
if we're going to exchange encrypted

530
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,919
data with them and

531
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,400
um this gsm

532
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,720
standard relying on symmetric symmetric

533
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
encryption

534
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
it's an important takeaway that it

535
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,159
didn't hit me initially when i think gsm

536
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,799
i think older cell phones right

537
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,640
i think like early

538
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
early gen is anybody who goes and gets

539
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
the latest and greatest right they're on

540
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,559
5g or lte or whatever acronym we want to

541
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,679
use today they're not using gsm are they

542
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,280
i don't know but

543
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
iot

544
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,799
iot devices gsm is incredibly popular as

545
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,880
i understand it as a way for those

546
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,200
devices to communicate with one another

547
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
and when we look at iot

548
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
and i

549
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200
am going to ask because i don't know

550
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,080
uh if i look at self-driving vehicles

551
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,919
how how is the

552
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,760
the data that's being sent to and from

553
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,000
those vehicles encrypted

554
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,559
how is it being protected is that gsm

555
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
does anybody know anybody

556
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,640
more likely

557
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
more more lte good

558
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
yeah getting started on that

559
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,080
right

560
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
uh usually they're mbiot standards or m1

561
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,840
standards uh lte 1 standards which are

562
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
used to communicate as opposed to the

563
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,799
chip sets and that's often

564
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,960
and they use uh lte or inner van lt

565
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,440
good you seem to know a lot about lte or

566
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,760
iot are you are you doing a talk today

567
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,919
on that

568
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,679
i hope now i'm glad we got daryl here to

569
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,000
to bring that that in um but uh even uh

570
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,640
symmetric encryption um which when i

571
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
look at uh tls certificates on the

572
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,159
internet they rely on symmetric

573
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,360
encryption

574
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,159
um

575
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,559
there are three examples here

576
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,080
of things that just work securely today

577
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,240
because the people who researched and

578
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,159
developed these algorithms and these

579
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,280
mechanisms for protecting data

580
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,840
spent decades doing it we put decades

581
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,679
deploying it and we've been spending

582
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,520
that same amount of time securing it and

583
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,320
these are three of the the top items at

584
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,559
risk when um when encryption is no

585
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,919
longer available

586
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,520
um there was a

587
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,480
quantum decryption proof of concept from

588
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,720
combo effort between google and the kth

589
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
royal institute of tech in stockholm

590
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,000
and um they were using a this is for the

591
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
math folks in the room they were using

592
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,960
modular exponentiation

593
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
to demonstrate that if they had

594
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,200
a 20 million cubic computer

595
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,600
they could break a 2048 bit rsa number

596
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,360
in eight hours

597
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,039
right the amount of time it takes me to

598
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,880
get my coffee to get my bourbon

599
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,279
and i know some of you will get that

600
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,520
but by comparison it'll take a classical

601
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,559
computer

602
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,919
around 300 trillion years

603
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,120
to break

604
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,320
2004 rsa 2048 bit encryption key that's

605
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
according to quinn assessments labs and

606
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,440
i've got the link here if you wanted to

607
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,960
read the poc

608
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
but that's what we're talking about in

609
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
terms of the exponential speed of

610
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,720
breaking these very large numbers

611
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
that data that we thought

612
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,080
was going to be protected for centuries

613
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,880
or

614
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,039
trillions of years

615
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,360
is now potentially

616
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,000
exposed to threat actors in the course

617
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,120
of the standard business day

618
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,640
yeah

619
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,880
all right

620
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,360
i like where you're going yep

621
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,480
i think i think we might be about 100

622
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,080
now so yeah 20 million is

623
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
currently

624
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
pretty far off and there's another

625
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,480
important um distinction i'll make

626
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,240
when we talk about uh error correction

627
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,520
and whether or not those uh those

628
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,440
um what i want to say

629
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
not functions transactions

630
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,120
whatever they are whether they're

631
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,000
error-free or not it determines whether

632
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,679
or not the size of the quantum computer

633
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,760
you can actually

634
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,520
achieve similar results with a much

635
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
smaller quantum computer

636
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,159
if uh you have error-free calculations

637
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
which is the word i was looking for a

638
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
minute ago and couldn't find

639
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
but that's a good call out right this is

640
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,919
that's why this is more of a a thought

641
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,440
experiment right they they didn't

642
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,039
demonstrate it because they actually had

643
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,600
it this was more of a projection of this

644
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,840
when we hit this state when we get this

645
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
kind of computer that's when it's uh

646
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,320
it's going to break but i mean pac-man

647
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,559
how how large is the pac-man game file

648
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,520
what is it 32-bits not bits

649
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,039
kilobytes

650
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,799
eight bits it's

651
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,120
pac-man right and of course i i'm gonna

652
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,720
age myself here date myself right

653
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,159
that game

654
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,320
was ridiculously tiny and dropped in

655
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,039
what 81.82

656
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
what's the latest overwatch right the

657
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,320
latest halo latest call of duty

658
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,600
these are how many gigs and we've got a

659
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,559
a shift we've had a shift from a little

660
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,200
uh character running around eating dots

661
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,080
to

662
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,799
um fully immersive and interactive games

663
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,880
where you just get totally caught up in

664
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,559
these fictional worlds

665
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
again in the course of our lifetime when

666
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,520
we get to the point that we've got a 4

667
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,559
000

668
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,120
bit error-free quantum computer that

669
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,760
they can do those calculations it's not

670
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,919
as far off as that 20 million number

671
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,200
makes it feel

672
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
yeah

673
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,559
there is only 127 processor which has

674
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,200
been developed by ibm

675
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,520
one more time

676
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,760
so today 127 cubits is

677
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,840
is the current yeah give it time it it

678
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
we'll see that number grow and it's it's

679
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,679
the innovation it's the people who are

680
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,960
saying we don't have to freeze it let's

681
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,039
use magnets it's the things that these

682
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,320
people are thinking about and

683
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
experimenting with that they'll find

684
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,080
ways to make this more

685
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,240
uh error-free more

686
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,799
efficient

687
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,520
we're just

688
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
i i don't see why not and so the

689
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,799
question was do i think it's going to

690
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,760
follow moore's law does anybody think no

691
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,679
i mean when i look at all things

692
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,679
technology

693
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,919
probably faster that's frightening

694
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,240
why why probably faster you got me

695
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,799
wondering now well

696
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,200
advancements in a lot of areas of

697
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,399
technology outstrip wars laws okay

698
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,840
that was transistor capacity

699
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
that's no that's a good point moore's

700
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
law was reflective of a different

701
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,320
earlier tech and with advances in tech

702
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,200
you know can have some areas or less

703
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,240
yeah

704
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,440
the ones that are going to provide the

705
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,240
most finance of money

706
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
far out

707
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,919
yeah the ones that are getting funded

708
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,000
are going to be yeah absolutely

709
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
to the 16 bits and encryption bids

710
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,840
can you raise much safer single future

711
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,720
um

712
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,399
it's a good question so the question was

713
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,320
how many bits do we need to protect

714
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,520
ourselves and i do have some

715
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,000
recommendations later ones around like

716
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,279
jumping from an aes 128 to an aes 256 if

717
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,600
you're using aes encryption

718
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,679
to make your your data quantum resistant

719
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,360
but to protect your data from quantum

720
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,799
attacks

721
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,679
um

722
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,600
we need to think about it differently

723
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,120
i've got a couple of things i'll get to

724
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
in a moment there but it's it's like we

725
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,000
can't solve the problem

726
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,120
based on

727
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,679
what we used to do we have to do

728
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,720
encryption differently

729
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,960
this is the the call out it's an article

730
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,360
from insider intelligence.com

731
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
they said that um you know you could

732
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,720
break uh

733
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
uh by rs they didn't put the key

734
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,919
strength but uh using 4 000 error-free

735
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,760
qubits um you can defeat rsa in seconds

736
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
and the stat i have over here on the

737
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,080
right um was

738
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,840
related to uh

739
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
um eo that's uh the growth in e-commerce

740
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,200
over the next five years

741
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
because every transaction right with

742
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,880
somebody made the comment about buying

743
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,279
from amazon earlier today right

744
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,760
i know how many amazon boxes show up at

745
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,279
my house and i know i need to take the

746
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,679
login away from some people

747
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,399
but

748
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,399
um

749
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,919
and

750
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,440
yes good call out smile.amazon.com

751
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,760
these transactions uh require encryption

752
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
to protect the credit card numbers right

753
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,279
to protect the the information and so um

754
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,240
while we're we're seeing this change

755
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,480
right where this this technology is

756
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,039
becoming faster more available

757
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,880
we're also seeing a parallel trend

758
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,679
unrelated where people are embracing all

759
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,640
things online even more and when we look

760
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,120
at advances in augmented reality virtual

761
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,240
reality uh how gaming is impacting uh

762
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
the development of that space because

763
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,159
gaming has a huge audience

764
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,440
and is drawing money in there um

765
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,080
all of this underscores the the need to

766
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
uh to get ahead of it

767
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,480
another shift is this notion that we

768
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,520
don't have to rely on the little plastic

769
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
identification cards that we carry

770
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
around in our wallets and our purses

771
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,520
anymore there are multiple states that

772
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,919
already support digital identity and

773
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,200
more than 20 states have either

774
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,720
considered tested or already launched

775
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,120
those including colorado hawaii

776
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,919
mississippi ohio and the territory of

777
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,200
puerto rico

778
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,080
um

779
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
when we're talking about protecting

780
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,760
encrypted data we're not just protecting

781
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,880
amazon purchases we're protecting the

782
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,760
identities that we use for applying for

783
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,600
bank accounts for applying for loans for

784
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,679
traveling internationally

785
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,039
for anything that requires an identity

786
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,799
boy it's kind of important to get ahead

787
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,679
of

788
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
keeping that data safe from people who

789
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,360
shouldn't be able to use it or abuse it

790
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,120
and then the other uh

791
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,760
uncomfortable conversation

792
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,240
um with a solarwinds hack

793
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,720
we saw a lot of data exfil

794
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,279
and people and this has been true for

795
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,880
people during that hack anybody who's

796
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,000
gone through a hipaa breach of

797
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,559
healthcare data it was encrypted

798
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,840
we're okay

799
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
right the attackers got encrypted data

800
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,760
so they got nothing that is not true

801
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,559
if i have a criminal organization if i

802
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,039
have a state-sponsored organization

803
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,200
who has their hands on an encrypted

804
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,640
trove of data

805
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,320
from a u.s uh branch of the the military

806
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,679
pick one

807
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,519
that has uh op information that has uh

808
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,320
contact information

809
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,559
that has

810
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,440
even in police departments undercover

811
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,919
uh individuals right when

812
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,880
that data is decrypted it's not just a

813
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,600
credit card that's expired so who cares

814
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,760
no that's that's stuff that those people

815
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,840
who want to exact revenge are going to

816
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,120
be able to act on

817
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,039
people are going to die

818
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,679
when that date is decrypted

819
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,640
and

820
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,039
we are at a point that

821
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,760
you can't just expire and undercover

822
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
identity right or expire the contacts

823
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,880
who helped you in a uh in an operation

824
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,919
against uh the the controlling regime

825
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,799
um

826
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,760
and so that's not just a past thing if

827
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,000
if you at the organization you work with

828
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,960
today

829
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,640
have an encrypted

830
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,120
data store that oh my god i hope nobody

831
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,039
ever gets their hands on this

832
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,720
and it makes its way out the door you're

833
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
not out of the woods just because it was

834
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,200
encrypted

835
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,480
so what we're uh seeing and this started

836
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,360
this pro this effort five years ago

837
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,760
right so this is 2017

838
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
they said uh we got to get ahead of this

839
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,519
quantum stuff what can we do how about

840
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,320
post-quantum cryptography how do we

841
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,480
encrypt data

842
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,840
securely

843
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,919
once quantum computing becomes more

844
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,519
readily available

845
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,840
and they actually kind of went back to

846
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,039
the drawing board and said we just need

847
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,159
new math

848
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,000
right the the math that we built

849
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,240
traditional encryption models on it's

850
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,159
not just that we can use stronger keys

851
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,640
which is our instinct today how strong

852
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,720
can i make my encryption key no

853
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,519
we've got to do encryption differently

854
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,080
does anybody work with lattices in the

855
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,000
math that you do

856
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,919
i don't know if that's

857
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,240
i i took calculus i was able to squeeze

858
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,159
five years of math into a four-year high

859
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,840
school degree and i don't remember a

860
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,079
damn thing from my calculus class i

861
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,199
tried

862
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,399
but it was it was a stretch and um i've

863
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,480
not been able to retain it

864
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,239
but they took 69 candidates

865
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,040
for

866
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,399
uh a post-quantum computing standard in

867
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,839
round one

868
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,359
and then put them through the paces

869
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,119
round two they got it down to 17

870
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,599
candidates and by this point they said

871
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,760
we're going to do uh pke and key

872
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,679
establishment algorithms and then we're

873
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,119
going to separate those from digital

874
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,800
signature algorithms slightly different

875
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
implementations so let's treat them

876
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,399
differently and then in round three they

877
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,280
shortlisted that to seven finalists and

878
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,520
eight alternates and their goal

879
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,399
was to publish a draft standard by 2024

880
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,359
which

881
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,520
is about five years projected before

882
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,239
google and ibm have committed to a one

883
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,839
million quantum uh or one million cubit

884
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,640
uh quantum commuter going live

885
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,520
um

886
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,839
so as john mentioned at the top of the

887
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,240
day and then right before i i

888
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,680
stepped up here

889
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,240
um on july 5th

890
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,079
nish said all right we're good here's

891
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,440
draft one

892
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,320
we have and i love this the nerd in me

893
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,040
you can have crystals kyber or crystals

894
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,680
dilithium uh for pke right km or uh the

895
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
digital signature and then falcon and

896
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,599
sphynx plus are available for digital

897
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,680
signatures and then they've already got

898
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,640
um four more candidates for round four

899
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
bike classic

900
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,680
elise

901
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,640
um hqc and and psych

902
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
so today

903
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
if you

904
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,280
well don't do it because it's saturday

905
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,440
go home hang out have some fun wait till

906
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,800
monday

907
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,359
but if you wanted to start reading up

908
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,839
on what's coming what do i need to

909
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,599
understand you don't need to necessarily

910
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,280
understand the ins and outs of these

911
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
algorithms

912
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,000
knowing what they are knowing which

913
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,440
vendors are trying to build

914
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,880
implementations around them knowing

915
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
who's working in the open source

916
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,160
community to build

917
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,880
uh solutions that align with this

918
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,960
standard that's what we need people to

919
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
learn today and that's what we're going

920
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,720
to need in the next three to five years

921
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,640
when this becomes more readily

922
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,440
available and then also keep an eye on

923
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,640
this nist working group because whatever

924
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,400
they release next it's going to be what

925
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,720
another year two years that's going to

926
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,040
drive how we solve this uh this problem

927
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,599
it's not just though that we're building

928
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
these solutions

929
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
i through the course of my career i

930
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,599
worked everything from hardware support

931
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,720
to help desk to entry-level

932
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,880
security analysts

933
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,440
managing building programs consulting

934
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,200
sales

935
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,359
and i did this on purpose i wanted

936
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,079
perspective of what it's like to work in

937
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,240
all these different roles

938
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,599
and when i put my sales hat back on

939
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
and i look at the

940
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,079
cyber security market that micah you had

941
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,200
those two graphs up here it's nuts folks

942
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
the amount of money that's being thrown

943
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
into this space is

944
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,359
unfathomable and it's because it's it's

945
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,560
that important

946
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,000
it's because that's how our world

947
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,640
operates now with all the technologies

948
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,040
that drive everything from keeping our

949
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,960
water clean to enabling those amazon

950
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,720
purchases

951
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,680
we need cyber security to make sure that

952
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
things aren't being disrupted or broken

953
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
and so there are vendors who are already

954
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,640
in this space of all things quantum and

955
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
post quantum

956
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,720
quantum dice and id quantique

957
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,520
uh are their technology focuses on

958
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,760
quantum random number generators

959
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,240
cats quantum security and toshiba have

960
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,040
the the key distribution uh and quantum

961
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
secure communications which gets into uh

962
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
fiber optics um pq shield and then um

963
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,760
cipher lock uh have uh post quantum

964
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,160
cryptography and quantum resistant

965
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,440
uh technologies and then xanadu um

966
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,400
uh

967
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,480
has a full stack quantum machine

968
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,079
learning um if this is your jam

969
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,320
and you want to learn more about where

970
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,920
this stuff is going

971
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,680
these people are already moving there

972
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,800
quickly

973
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,280
take a look at what they've published

974
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,760
connect with them if you use linkedin

975
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,200
talk to the people at the companies and

976
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,880
say you know what can you tell me about

977
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,560
what you're doing they want to tell

978
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,000
people they want people to know what's

979
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,880
going on and this is a a short list

980
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,400
these are just a couple of the ones that

981
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
stood out to me there are a lot more

982
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
folks in that space

983
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,880
but as that money is going into

984
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,480
financial institutions who want to use

985
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,599
quantum computing to make more money

986
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,280
then you're also going to have cyber

987
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,839
security companies building quantum

988
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,680
resistant and quantum

989
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,320
like post-quantum cryptography solutions

990
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
to solve that problem

991
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,160
and then

992
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
you may not know this but congress

993
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,640
actually passed the u.s

994
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,960
national quantum initiative act in

995
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,599
december of 2018.

996
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,359
didn't get a lot of press there's a lot

997
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,520
of other things that end up

998
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,880
in the news but one of the the

999
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
statements was arguably the key

1000
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,440
bottleneck in quantum computing

1001
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,720
industry will be the lack of talent

1002
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,640
while universities churn out computer

1003
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
science graduates at an accelerating

1004
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,800
pace there is still too little being

1005
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,359
done to train the next generation of

1006
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,599
quantum computing professionals

1007
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,280
it's not that we need folks to learn

1008
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,119
this today it's that we needed them to

1009
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,880
learn it five years ago

1010
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,359
and we're still you know catching up and

1011
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,800
trying to figure out how do we get there

1012
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,040
ahead um

1013
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,839
that uh bleeds into uh there's a

1014
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,040
resource i want to share in just a

1015
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,720
moment

1016
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,800
i'm going to ask that if you look at

1017
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,960
web3 or anybody who follows jack dorsey

1018
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,160
web5

1019
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,079
web 2 plus web 3.

1020
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,680
um

1021
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,839
put put all the buzzwords and marketing

1022
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,359
aside

1023
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,839
when we see the evolution of what we've

1024
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,160
called web one traditional internet

1025
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,599
based on the semantic web paper to web 2

1026
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,480
where

1027
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
organizations control the infrastructure

1028
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,440
and users are creating the content which

1029
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,839
is where we are right now

1030
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,359
web 3

1031
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,079
is the language we use to describe the

1032
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,760
decentralization of these technologies

1033
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,680
can i stand up

1034
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,760
a device at my house that has the

1035
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,280
ability to talk to a device of my

1036
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
neighbors that has a device to talk to

1037
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,720
their neighbors and we create our own

1038
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,760
internet

1039
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,920
you can do that today with uh like what

1040
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,800
is it

1041
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,079
i2p

1042
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,040
um

1043
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,480
like tor

1044
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,079
there's there are a couple of of

1045
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,680
alternatives to tor that are built on

1046
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,839
that peer-to-peer networking well if we

1047
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,520
look at the advances in 3d printing

1048
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
accessibility of some of this technology

1049
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,599
the growth of the maker community

1050
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,880
there are all these things coming

1051
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,480
together and saying look we don't have

1052
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
to put all our data at facebook or at

1053
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
amazon we can

1054
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,599
own it

1055
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,079
and make it our own and build things

1056
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
that uh from a hardware and software

1057
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,119
perspective

1058
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:10,160
decentralize that take it out of their

1059
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,240
hands there's even a term doused

1060
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,640
decentralized autonomous organizations

1061
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,040
it's very common in web 3 about these

1062
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,400
these organizations that don't really

1063
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,800
have a leader right they don't have a a

1064
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,040
board they don't have a ceo but they

1065
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,280
still work and this is this is real

1066
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,040
stuff that's already happening today as

1067
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,359
you look at web 3

1068
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,880
and some of the technologies that

1069
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,359
are coming out of the the folks working

1070
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,800
in that space

1071
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
we have an opportunity to think

1072
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,319
differently about privacy data and now

1073
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,000
this is where i'm going to be a little

1074
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,440
heretical

1075
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,720
and say what if we didn't have to

1076
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,599
encrypt social security numbers

1077
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,200
i don't think we have to protect them

1078
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,079
once we we get to this point if

1079
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,319
i can take this notion of confidential

1080
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,400
data there are certain data elements not

1081
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,440
all of them

1082
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,599
certain data elements that i can make

1083
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,760
publicly available and i'm not talking

1084
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,800
the lifelock ceo who puts his social no

1085
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,880
i'm not talking that i'm talking

1086
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,160
when we change how people can use our

1087
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,440
private data

1088
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,760
when this decentralization enables me to

1089
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,839
have more real-time control over that

1090
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:16,800
data

1091
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,520
then if i go to apply for a car loan and

1092
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,040
somebody wants to run my credit and they

1093
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,839
need my social i get a notification on

1094
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:24,880
my phone

1095
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,359
that it checks some blockchain that says

1096
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,280
here's jared's social

1097
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,359
we want to use it to run credit do we

1098
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,440
have jared's permission to do that

1099
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,119
i authenticate with my thumb right or

1100
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,359
you know face whatever you want to do

1101
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,760
and at that time i can say yes it's okay

1102
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,200
to use my data

1103
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,520
if we can get to a point where we have

1104
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,680
decentralized technology that gives

1105
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,079
users more control over their data

1106
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,280
we don't have to keep everything

1107
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,359
encrypted anymore

1108
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,200
we can change uh

1109
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,599
pci and credit card encryption now there

1110
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,040
will be some things like my private

1111
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,040
health information i still want that

1112
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,079
protected that's a privacy thing privacy

1113
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,760
and security are related they're not the

1114
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,040
same

1115
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,480
when it comes to those military

1116
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
operations and you've got

1117
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,079
information that puts people's lives at

1118
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,920
danger no that still needs to be

1119
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,160
encrypted that's where we see the value

1120
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,760
of post-quantum cryptography but don't

1121
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,240
think we have to do everything the same

1122
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,079
as we're doing it today

1123
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,599
it's not just a matter of changing

1124
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,240
encryption and decryption it's embracing

1125
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,200
uh

1126
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,280
ancillary technologies

1127
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,839
to enable us to do things differently

1128
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,920
and if we accept that

1129
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,000
if we let go of some of the old ways

1130
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,240
that we used to to do this stuff and say

1131
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,839
we're going to support

1132
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,359
these projects

1133
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,720
we're going to build out these

1134
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,440
technologies then you reduce the impact

1135
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,200
to the folks that

1136
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,520
you support and protect every day

1137
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,359
whether it's folks you work with whether

1138
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,560
it's your family whether it's your

1139
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,440
friends

1140
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,920
that's the the impact of making these

1141
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,599
changes

1142
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,240
so some strategic planning questions

1143
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,000
um today

1144
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,839
right what can we do because i've i've

1145
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,680
talked about a lot of big picture stuff

1146
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,680
and there's a lot of stuff that

1147
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,200
sounds like boy it'd be great if we

1148
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,640
could get there how the hell are we

1149
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,920
going to get there

1150
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,200
i understand that some of this is a

1151
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,440
little further off pulling it closer to

1152
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
the here and now if you go back to your

1153
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,040
organization and just say let's take a

1154
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,119
look at our data classification standard

1155
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,440
let's look at our sensitive data sets

1156
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,720
business critical

1157
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
right what are they

1158
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,920
do we know where all that data is do we

1159
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,680
know what the elements are in that data

1160
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,160
that that kind of inventory is an

1161
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
important first step and then you take a

1162
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,560
look at quantum computing and ask the

1163
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,040
questions well when quantum computing

1164
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,000
hits

1165
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,640
uh from an operational perspective not a

1166
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,599
security perspective it's operational

1167
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,920
how's that going to hurt our business

1168
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,359
are we going to lose business to

1169
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,880
competitors because we've got an

1170
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
advantage now that goes away

1171
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,560
once quantum becomes more readily

1172
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,800
available and at the same time what are

1173
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,720
the business opportunities

1174
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,400
where are we getting hammered today as a

1175
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,720
company that boy if we had data or if we

1176
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,240
had the opportunity to churn through

1177
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,400
really large data sets very quickly

1178
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,839
where could we edge out our competition

1179
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,599
understand how quantum is going to

1180
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,760
affect your business before you look at

1181
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,920
the security stuff and then the other

1182
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,960
question what training do you need

1183
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,160
around web and quantum i mean i i

1184
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,839
appreciate the the

1185
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,480
university space i worked at osu for a

1186
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,960
number of years and i'm a strong

1187
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,160
proponent

1188
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,400
of lifelong learning a lot of that's

1189
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,079
from my my stoicism background but uh

1190
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,440
i firmly believe that we we can't ever

1191
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,319
stop

1192
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,160
learning about the new stuff

1193
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,839
right even if it's just like spending a

1194
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,079
saturday here listen to jared rant and

1195
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,920
rave about quantum right that's an

1196
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
opportunity for us to to take away

1197
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,119
something we didn't know or didn't

1198
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,640
understand before

1199
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,480
we need to have these conversations with

1200
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,880
the leadership of our organizations

1201
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,720
do you have training for me do i

1202
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,440
understand how to build a smart contract

1203
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,119
do i understand the difference between

1204
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,359
the ethereum blockchain and the solana

1205
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,880
blockchain

1206
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,200
right there there's some

1207
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,960
basic stuff you can learn today that's

1208
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,640
going to be the building blocks to get

1209
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,960
you to that three to five year goal

1210
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,880
of how can we leverage

1211
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,680
uh decentralized technology to minimize

1212
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,920
the the potential threats of quantum

1213
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,680
computing and then who are you going to

1214
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,280
partner with to address your gaps and

1215
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,560
again this comes from working with

1216
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,920
vendors not every vendor is evil i can't

1217
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,599
vouch for all of them

1218
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,280
but i can tell you

1219
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,319
that

1220
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,400
if you get in with the right group of

1221
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,440
folks

1222
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,280
and say keep me in the loop let me be

1223
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,839
your beta tester right bounce ideas off

1224
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,240
me because this is my day job and this

1225
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,400
is a prospective vendor that you don't

1226
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,319
have when you're off developing your

1227
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,079
solution in a vacuum

1228
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,079
right if you partner with these

1229
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,240
organizations today the stuff that they

1230
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,480
build is going to be better

1231
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,319
and it's going to be more

1232
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,359
useful

1233
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,359
to the people that you're supporting and

1234
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,400
that you're trying to protect

1235
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
this list of recommended actions comes

1236
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,800
from the belfor center belfor center for

1237
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
science and international affairs

1238
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,079
research

1239
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,920
which is part of harvard

1240
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,880
harvard

1241
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,960
i'll leave this up here but they had

1242
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,880
some recommended actions for if you're

1243
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,040
in the government space

1244
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,960
here's our our recommended list of

1245
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,720
things that you should do today

1246
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,200
if you're in the private business space

1247
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,040
here's our recommended list of things

1248
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,559
you should do and if you wanted to see

1249
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,319
more detail

1250
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,400
the publication quantum computing and

1251
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,720
cyber security is freely available on

1252
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,920
their website it's a takeaway that you

1253
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,440
could go back and say okay this will

1254
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,839
give me a little more direction

1255
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,839
recommendation for university i don't

1256
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,160
see the theater

1257
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,839
oh that's a good call out

1258
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,599
take it up i mean they're that's a

1259
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,760
higher ed institution that's a miss on

1260
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,240
their part that's a good call out

1261
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,598
yeah put some university recommendations

1262
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,400
yes

1263
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,440
this area is not just for computer

1264
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,280
science

1265
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,000
so what is your opinion about that

1266
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,160
about where this lives in the university

1267
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,480
space

1268
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,440
when i was at ohio state

1269
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,119
um and this was

1270
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,319
five plus years ago maybe close to seven

1271
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,720
they were trying to interview introduce

1272
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,680
a cyber security major

1273
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,960
and the uh internal argument the game of

1274
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,359
hot potato right who's going to own it

1275
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,040
right fischer college of business well

1276
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,559
no this is cyber security that's a

1277
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,960
technical thing computer science no this

1278
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,040
i mean has business impact we're doing

1279
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,280
research this is more of a tactical

1280
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,680
operational thing it ended up in

1281
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,520
international affairs

1282
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,240
counter-terrorism yeah right blew my

1283
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,079
mind but that was the closest lady you

1284
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,599
found somebody who had the ownership and

1285
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,000
the passion for it from a

1286
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,640
a technical standpoint computer science

1287
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,400
absolutely has to be involved i'll stand

1288
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,640
by that because

1289
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,920
what we're talking about from a

1290
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,000
technical level can

1291
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,559
easily be misconstrued or misinterpreted

1292
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,640
once it gets to the business side

1293
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,800
but if if i were

1294
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,880
if i had my brothers

1295
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,119
i would have

1296
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,200
parallel programs and i don't know that

1297
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,720
universities do this

1298
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,960
but it's it's a blend between uh

1299
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,480
whatever the college of business is in

1300
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,040
the college of uh science and then maybe

1301
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,200
you know international terrorism for

1302
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,880
kicks that's a

1303
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,400
whole nother thing

1304
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,119
and i'm almost done here last few slides

1305
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,680
if you only do three things right and

1306
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,760
these are the if i'm talking low hanging

1307
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,119
fruit these are the apples that have

1308
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,880
already fallen on the ground

1309
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,800
if you've got 128 bit aes keys in play

1310
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,559
next time you change them

1311
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,359
explore the production impact of bumping

1312
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,119
them up to 256

1313
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,200
because it's going to take more compute

1314
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
to do the encrypt decrypt

1315
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,280
if it slows the apps down to the point

1316
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,559
that they're unusable you've done more

1317
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,720
harm than good don't do that

1318
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,400
but if you can

1319
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,440
um

1320
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,359
making it harder

1321
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,119
for this data to be

1322
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,200
compromised

1323
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,480
it just gives you more time to make

1324
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
those changes kick in the can down the

1325
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,680
road

1326
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,160
explore emerging technologies like

1327
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,800
blockchain blockchain is not just a

1328
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,400
public ledger

1329
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,839
you can do full compute in the

1330
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:40,960
blockchain

1331
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,640
a lot of folks will look at blockchain

1332
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,559
and say well that's just a an immutable

1333
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,319
ledger where i can put a historical

1334
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,920
record of data no

1335
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,280
it's more than that

1336
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,680
explore those those other options to see

1337
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,800
what you can do

1338
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,319
passwordless authentication and

1339
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,720
self-sovereign identity i think are two

1340
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,079
of the things that we're talking about

1341
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,599
you see a lot of ssi i read a white

1342
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,920
paper from world economic forum a few

1343
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,359
years back where they were talking about

1344
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,480
ssi

1345
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,839
um but uh with the group like the 502

1346
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,680
alliance or fido alliance um what

1347
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,720
they're doing

1348
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,559
with passwordless authentication these

1349
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,440
are um again building blocks that help

1350
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,119
us get to uh

1351
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,200
a different way of doing things and then

1352
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,839
um etsy the um

1353
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,440
etsi.org

1354
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,920
migration strategies and recommendations

1355
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,079
to quantum safe schemes

1356
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,000
um they've got a a

1357
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,440
brief white paper i'll go ahead and tell

1358
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,880
you the right the avoid the click bait

1359
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,720
inventory compilation prepare your

1360
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,640
migration plan and then execute

1361
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,720
migration that's what it was down to

1362
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,920
figure out where you're going to be most

1363
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,079
impacted make a plan and act on it but

1364
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,680
those are the three things i'd recommend

1365
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,119
you do today

1366
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,119
and then for further reading i've got an

1367
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,280
article from forbes american scientist

1368
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,640
and then

1369
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,480
the quantum security

1370
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,640
world economic forum is a fantastic

1371
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,319
resource folks if you are not following

1372
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,599
that group as a cyber security

1373
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,599
professional you're missing out because

1374
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,079
what they're talking about impacts so

1375
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,000
much of what we do and where we're going

1376
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,079
but their call out for us a quantum

1377
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,160
security coalition

1378
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,559
it's a big one

1379
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,319
