thank you for everyone that put together

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,559
this conference i'm having a great time

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,199
learning a lot of things i'm coming at

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,280
you not only

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
after lunch but also with a grc talk so

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,359
i

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
i'm going to leave it at that with that

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,280
being said

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
growing up i played a card game called

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,520
magic the gathering it was founded in

34
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,159
1993 and in many ways i learned a lot of

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
concepts a lot of strategy that is

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,080
directly applicable to my role as an i.t

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,600
security engineer and architect within

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
the organization that i work for for

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,000
those that do not know magic the

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
gathering or mtg as it's called is a

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,759
social card game in which two or more

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,880
people create their own customized decks

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
based out of cards that they choose

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,720
and to play in that game today there's

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,840
about 50 000 cards that have been

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,720
released over the 20 i believe it's 29

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,479
years of the game

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,159
at the heart mtg is a game of strategy

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159
resource management and requires

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
tracking of both known and unknown

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,880
knowledge

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,719
what does that sound like

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,320
that sounds like what we do what

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,959
challenges we face in information

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,878
security

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,800
that being said

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
one of the most beautiful things in my

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,160
mind about the game

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,959
is

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,120
that to this day you can take cards

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
printed this year put them in

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
with cards from the very first set

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
and it tells a clear story the cards

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,760
seem to work with each other and that's

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
one of the greatest things in my mind

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
about this game is they've been able to

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
craft their story craft their narrative

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
they've been clearly able to go through

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,519
and to define

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
what each color what each card object

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
does and how they interact in a

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
consistent way over 29 years and that's

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,160
something interesting

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
so

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
how do you win

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
in magic there are many different ways

77
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
the first and most obvious is you start

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
with a certain amount of life and you

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,959
reduce

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,519
your opponent's life down to zero

81
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,879
you can go through and you can win if

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,920
your

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
opponent gains

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
10 poison counters you if you try to

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,480
draw a card from an empty deck you're

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
going to lose if you are

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
such an obnoxious opponent that your

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,799
opponent concedes you win

89
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
some cards in and of themselves have

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,120
victory conditions and some cards have

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,920
special text that negate victory

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,080
conditions

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
once again

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
how do you go through and how do you win

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,519
within your role i would argue that a

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,080
sock analyst they probably go through

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,159
and have a different victory condition

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
in their day in their week in their

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,040
month

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
then somebody that might be on the help

101
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
desk or somebody that's on the cso so we

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
need to understand within our role

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
within our organization

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,480
how do we win what metrics do we care to

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
go through and measure and how do we

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,439
communicate our success as it it

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,760
security

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
that being

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
stated then one of the great things

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
about magic is there are different ways

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,400
or formats that you can play the game

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
in a game of limited you start with seal

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,519
product and you build a 40 card deck and

114
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,680
what this is great about is it allows

115
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,320
anyone to sit down and to have a chance

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,759
at having

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
a deck at the same power then you get to

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
more constructed formats which is where

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
you pick exactly which cards from your

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
collection and standard

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,960
that's one of the default ways to play

122
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
and you roughly can play with cards that

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
were printed in certain sets about two

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
years old it constantly refreshes

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
modern

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,320
is once again it's a 60 card deck and

127
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
you can go through and you can pick

128
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
cards since a certain expansion up and

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
it's a non-rotating so

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
if it's legal and modern it's always

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,880
going to be legal and modern

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
legacy is an even larger card pool

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
whereas commander this is the first time

134
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
that we have a 100 card deck and it has

135
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,360
some other special rules i won't go into

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
it it's not really

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,479
that important and then you have vintage

138
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,560
where pretty much every card from the

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
beginning of the game is legal

140
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,039
yeah exactly

141
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
but as an i.t security

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,520
person we have our own formats that we

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
have to play in and these could be

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,320
things like rules laws regulations and

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,120
those are external factors you might

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
have contractual agreements you might

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,080
have your own internal company policies

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
you might have partner policies so we

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
need to go through and to be able to

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
clearly dictate

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,720
both what external

152
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,639
and what internal controls requirements

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,560
that we have established and that we

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,440
must go through and follow

155
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
another concept i turn that i learned a

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
lot from

157
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
was the concept of deck types so when

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
you're building these decks there are

159
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
three main architects archetypes that

160
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
they built in the game and that is aggro

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
where you want to win as fast as

162
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,319
possible there's combo where you're

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
looking to set up interactions between

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,160
two or more cards that set up a

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
condition that you instantly went on the

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
spot and then there's the control

167
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,120
players and the control players they

168
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
like to go through and to directly

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
influence what

170
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,919
the rules of the games are and honestly

171
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
that was my most fun

172
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,880
i had was playing control

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,159
but when we think about it

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,199
i.t security is a very large discipline

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,240
right

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,479
and so within that

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,280
an effective i.t security program should

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
touch all parts of technology within an

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
ite within an organization and this is

180
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,639
where

181
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,240
no one person can have mastery in my

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
mind of all aspects

183
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
of i.t security this

184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
so we need to acknowledge

185
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
where we are

186
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
strong as well as where we are weak for

187
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
example i gave my web application

188
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,400
firewall talk to you last year i believe

189
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,280
and in there the main reason the project

190
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
was going through and failing

191
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
is because we weren't setting each other

192
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,039
up for success i had an application

193
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
security engineer that was trying to do

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
networking infrastructure work

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,199
now the guy's smart he's talented but he

196
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,960
had to work a lot harder and that was

197
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
leading to delay so instead

198
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
i realigned the project so that me

199
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
coming from a network admin server admin

200
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
role i took care of the first part of

201
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,319
putting the web application firewall

202
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
online where i then handed it off to my

203
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,639
application security engineer to assist

204
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
in the tuning and then i handed it off

205
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,360
to the support team to do the 24 7 care

206
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
maintenance feeding support of the

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
device so we need to actualize

208
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
what are our strengths we need to

209
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,520
actualize

210
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,960
what are our weaknesses and we need to

211
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,840
be able to make sure that we are setting

212
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,280
both ourselves

213
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,520
and our colleagues up for success

214
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,400
so

215
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
one of the

216
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,560
oldest traditions within magic is they

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
spent a lot of time on the

218
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
psychographics

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
and they have within there the concept

220
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
of timmy johnny and spike now timmy is

221
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,520
the type of player that gets excited by

222
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,519
playing really big spells really big

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,120
creatures to timmy the fun is in doing

224
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,919
really big awesome things it's more

225
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,479
about the quality of wind than the

226
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,000
quantity

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
johnny

228
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,839
is a creative gamer he likes to win but

229
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,480
he likes to win in his own way so they

230
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
somebody that's more of a johnny is

231
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,880
actually going to develop certain combos

232
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,839
or want to sculpt a certain setup on the

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
board in order to win with style and

234
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
spike is the hyper competitive person

235
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,120
that wants to win at any cost so within

236
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
each of these players psychodynamics

237
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,440
wizards of the coast who creates magic

238
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
the gathering goes through and in every

239
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,519
set they have cards that directly target

240
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
each and every one of these player

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
dynamics

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,320
so what motivates your company

243
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
exactly

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
and i would assert because

245
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,519
i work at a very large organization a

246
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,000
global organization truth

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
when i go through and i take a look at

248
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,240
what motivates our remote claims agent

249
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
it's something really different than

250
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
even the claims agents that are on the

251
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
call center

252
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
let alone be at management be it the it

253
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
run i often have a joke that

254
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,080
where i t secure or where i t says the

255
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,920
packets must flow

256
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,200
i.t security says the packets must flow

257
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,920
only to the authorized users so we need

258
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
to understand what each of our groups

259
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,160
what they're motivated with so we can

260
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,880
target our messaging our branding so

261
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,920
that we can make doing the simple way or

262
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
the secure way this simple way for each

263
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
of those groups and that's all about

264
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,800
going through and understanding what

265
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,320
motivates

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,480
each of your groups

267
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,839
now one of the greatest things in my

268
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,399
opinion that magic's the gathering did

269
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,880
is they created the color pie

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,040
and the color pie for each of the five

271
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,800
colors in magic

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,440
each of them means something and so they

273
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,519
created this visualization and this was

274
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
back in the 90s that clearly set out

275
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,880
what each color did what were their

276
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
strengths what were their weaknesses

277
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
so that because of this the existence of

278
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,760
this very simple infographic today if i

279
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
were to add a new card to a deck

280
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
it would feel like it fits it's kind of

281
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
hard for me to say by having this

282
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,839
distinct of a visualization that's very

283
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
simple very approachable

284
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
to define each of the five types of

285
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,320
magic has allowed them to create a

286
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,600
consistent narrative for over 29 years

287
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,440
this is what our color pie looks today

288
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,320
it's kind of messy

289
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
and this is of course my good friend's

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
optivs uh

291
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
mapping and of course these change by

292
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
the month

293
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
and here's another one from cyberscape

294
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,600
if any of you ever go to rsa you can be

295
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,560
blown away about the magnitude of the

296
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,519
actual vendor hall it's truly

297
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,720
huge

298
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
and to this point

299
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
i almost get overwhelmed in looking at

300
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
this but there's something beautiful and

301
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,639
seeing how different people have grouped

302
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,160
different type of protective

303
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,440
technologies in and throughout the

304
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
entirety

305
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
of the cyberspace

306
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,279
so

307
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,200
this comes to a point

308
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,279
where my boss came to me and this was

309
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
right around the time where you know we

310
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
were told 14 days to slow the spread and

311
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
he says micah

312
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
we've got to do something about our

313
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
documentation we've got to do something

314
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
about communicating who and what we as

315
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,000
i.t security are it needs to include

316
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,880
people it needs to include processes it

317
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,200
needs to include the technologies and

318
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,440
the controls that we have in place

319
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,839
and i had to go and grab a bottle of

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,760
bourbon because i knew where he was

321
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
trying to lead me

322
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
just an odd thing happened to me the

323
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,959
other day

324
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,160
i went through

325
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
and i got a call from one of the itso's

326
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
it's the technical term for cso in my

327
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
organization

328
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
and

329
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
i've been sentenced to a year and a half

330
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,040
of policy mapping within my organization

331
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,399
[Music]

332
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,760
yes just one bottle

333
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,880
with that being said

334
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,639
we transformed from a two line of

335
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,399
defense organization to a three line of

336
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,240
defense organization

337
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
what does that mean it means that no

338
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,440
longer could i t and i t security right

339
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
policy

340
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,880
instead what we could write under our

341
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
new it norms

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
is we could write guidelines and we

343
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,800
could write work instructions and those

344
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,600
be

345
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
actually

346
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
binding to the business

347
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
now

348
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,279
what our internal risk management team

349
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,680
did is they took the thing that is

350
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,800
beauty

351
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,880
the thing that is a shining nay a golden

352
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
example for i.t security nist 853

353
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,360
and they bastardized it

354
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
they added

355
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
control requirements that if i were to

356
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
read them strictly would say that

357
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
portable media

358
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,639
needs to be able to be remotely wiped

359
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,800
i was called flip it when i held up a

360
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,839
usb stick i said how do i remotely wipe

361
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,480
this it does not have a cpu it does not

362
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
have a network connection

363
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,160
but in but then you're requiring the cpu

364
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
on the computer that it's plugged into

365
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,959
so

366
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
this is where

367
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,360
we needed to obviously communicate

368
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,399
better

369
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,360
as i t as i t security

370
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,120
our mission our vision our values

371
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
what we're doing and quantify it

372
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
so

373
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,880
to bring this all together

374
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
we need to be able to answer these types

375
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
of questions

376
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,199
how do you excuse me how do you win

377
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
within your organization

378
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
what role or roles do you play in your

379
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
organization i.e what type of a deca are

380
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,839
you

381
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,399
how can you best visualize your

382
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,680
resources

383
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
what constraints do you have and how do

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,839
you communicate it so once again the

385
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
idea of the color pie

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
how do you communicate where your

387
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
strengths and your weaknesses are

388
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,680
how do you know what motivates your

389
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
individual groups within your business

390
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,320
and are you able to clearly define your

391
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,880
architecture

392
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,839
so this is reminiscent of my first

393
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,360
example so

394
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,199
i know it's very small but that's to

395
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,440
show you even

396
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,160
at and i modeled a

397
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
a generic

398
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,480
medium-sized business and all of the

399
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
things that we would have to go through

400
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,000
and to do in order to have a decent

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
visualization of i.t security this goes

402
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,639
through it covers technology controls

403
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,320
process procedures and people

404
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,279
so let's

405
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,560
dig into it

406
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
so

407
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,959
in the anything in the blue is an i t

408
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,680
or i t security technology stack so that

409
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,959
is going to be

410
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,120
a device that could be like windows

411
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
servers linux servers firewalls routers

412
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,519
web application firewalls

413
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,959
we have an i.t security technology type

414
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,480
we have an i.t security program and we

415
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
have at high level policies

416
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,279
so

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
breaking it down

418
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,160
into kind of like a car dealership

419
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,199
the i.t security technology stack that's

420
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,440
like a car manufacturer where the

421
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
technology type

422
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,920
that's your car model and the i.t

423
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,120
security program well that's the

424
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,360
different groups within the organization

425
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
that allow it to work so you might have

426
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
a finance group you might have a

427
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
mechanics group you might have a sales

428
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,120
force group and finally we have the

429
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,920
policies and all of these interact with

430
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,079
each other and that's really was trying

431
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,720
to go through and show with the

432
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,400
visualization any questions so far

433
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,679
so

434
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,280
for example

435
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
we have i have the concept of

436
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,439
organizational servers

437
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,240
so

438
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,199
we have a windows server and we can see

439
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,760
i just went through and i listed

440
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,640
the different types of controls

441
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,679
that we had applied to our windows

442
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,039
servers

443
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,160
likewise

444
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,559
i did the same thing with the linux

445
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,880
and then i realized that some of our

446
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
devices are not our traditional windows

447
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,039
images they're not our traditional linux

448
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,880
images they're

449
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,919
usually appliances that are built on

450
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,480
some sort of linux or bsd that have

451
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
customized software and you know many of

452
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
many a time we don't even have the

453
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
passwords to log into the actual os so i

454
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,039
created a non-standard servers and or

455
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,600
appliances

456
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,799
group to capture those

457
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
likewise

458
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
this is an example of our program stack

459
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,240
so

460
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
within

461
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,559
this group is

462
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,440
the orange box represents a team within

463
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
our organization and we can actually put

464
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
the names of the people in there and

465
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,400
then i created a tools or controls that

466
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
that group

467
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,559
is responsible for and the idea is is

468
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,960
that all of these are supposed to be

469
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
clickable so that you could just jump

470
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
from one to another i'm getting a little

471
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
bit ahead of myself but we'll talk about

472
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,480
it later and then the final thing that i

473
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
wanted to go through and map in

474
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
was the policies so these are things

475
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
like your baseline security standard

476
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
maybe you might have

477
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
a different name for it it could be your

478
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,039
cloud security

479
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,280
policy it could be your system hardening

480
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
guides but i wanted to go through for

481
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,919
each of our formal policy documents have

482
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,640
a representation of it that is open that

483
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,000
is friendly that is very accessible to

484
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
people

485
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,000
and so

486
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,679
when i presented

487
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,360
the initial

488
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,480
concept to my boss

489
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
he liked it he liked it that it boiled

490
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,120
it down to well it wasn't the one page

491
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,919
or

492
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,679
a single image but if you were to print

493
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,760
it out it'd be multiple pages but it's

494
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
something that we could take to the

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
board we could take to

496
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
our architecture engineering we could

497
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
take to our auditors and we could say

498
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,280
this is how we provide security

499
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,160
to our organization

500
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
but i wasn't

501
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,320
i wasn't very happy with that i mean

502
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,280
it's great that i had a picture

503
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
but one of the problems that i have day

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,240
in and day out

505
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,640
is and i find this with larger

506
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,080
organizations the larger you get

507
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
the harder it is to make sure that all

508
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,960
parts of it and i.t security are fully

509
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,880
aware of what

510
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,120
is being required of them of all of the

511
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,440
devices that you have to go through to

512
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,039
protect all of the policies that you're

513
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,000
bound by to this point i was reached out

514
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,559
to by the itzo by the etso just the

515
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,200
other day and i was presented a document

516
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,960
from legal that had been existing for

517
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
a significant period of time i went

518
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,440
through i was reading it this was a

519
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
legal policy document that was defining

520
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,840
what how i t and i t security had to

521
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
operate in our part of the world

522
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
only under our new

523
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
i.t documentation standards

524
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
i'm questioning does legal even have

525
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,919
that ability now i love what the a lot

526
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
was being brought into this document or

527
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,919
a lot that was in the document but i

528
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,919
thought that it should be

529
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
in either i.t security

530
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,159
i.t

531
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,600
or possibly our risk management policies

532
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,480
our

533
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,120
work instructions or guidelines

534
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,799
and so

535
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,960
this goes through

536
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
and is

537
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,559
one of the main reasons or this type of

538
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
situation was one of the main reasons

539
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,679
why i wanted to take that visualization

540
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,200
and i wanted to make it more i wanted to

541
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,799
make it interactable i wanted to have a

542
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,559
single

543
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,360
place where i could point anyone in i.t

544
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,799
to go through

545
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,520
and to be able to find out the who what

546
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
where why and how for each of those

547
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,280
components to have them

548
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,000
linked to each other so i got the idea

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
of building out a wiki and so

550
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
i jokingly called

551
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
the

552
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,880
the project amarfate which means to love

553
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,000
fate

554
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
because let me tell you i was in some

555
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
dark policy mapping times at the point

556
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,039
so i wanted it to be

557
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,440
more than just a video visio i wanted to

558
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,679
be interactive i wanted it to be to link

559
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,760
to all of the different components i

560
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,679
wanted it to have a one page summary for

561
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,240
each control each program each policy

562
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
that clearly explains the who what where

563
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,679
when why the how i wanted to have links

564
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,000
to where more information on that

565
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,120
component

566
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
is stored

567
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,280
so that somebody if they were authorized

568
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,760
to have access could go to this tool do

569
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
a quick look up and find oh the more

570
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,679
technical documentation is right here at

571
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,440
this sharepoint link and just go through

572
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,679
and go at it i wanted to reach out to

573
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,440
team members and get them the direct

574
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,159
information on who to contact how to

575
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
contact maybe there's a certain email

576
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,320
that that entire group uses making it

577
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
easier to find out information and

578
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,919
report information

579
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,080
and i wanted each

580
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,559
of the controls the tools the program

581
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,919
not only to map back to internal policy

582
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,080
but also go through and map back to

583
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,799
external standards external

584
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,200
rules laws regulations where applicable

585
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,559
so

586
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,240
i started out saying i wanted to do a

587
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
rapid proof of concept so i went through

588
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,280
and i said okay i'll spin up an ubuntu

589
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
server

590
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
pretty simple

591
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,000
a simple vm

592
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,559
i looked at all of the wiki applications

593
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,159
and because at the time i hadn't played

594
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,799
around much with docker i chose one that

595
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,320
was based on docker that way i was

596
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
learning something new so i chose

597
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
wiki.js

598
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,919
open source i found it to be very

599
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,640
easy to go through and to work with i'm

600
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,799
not saying that i would use this in a

601
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,720
final build i was just saying for a

602
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,200
prototype this was actually pretty good

603
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
i added to that a couple rum and cokes

604
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,120
and i used

605
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
well there's a reason why rum is first

606
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,750
my friend

607
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,890
[Laughter]

608
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,840
and so

609
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,760
with that i started the build and

610
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
i do have a copy i can put it on a usb

611
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
stick if anyone

612
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,520
is interested and wants to play around

613
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,400
with it however this is not

614
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,279
meant to be run in production to do the

615
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,440
full build of the wiki

616
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,400
system it or wiki js it literally was

617
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,880
like 15 minutes is very intuitive very

618
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,960
easy to start and we'll go through some

619
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
of the processes here in just a minute

620
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
um but once again

621
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,320
it has default credentials baked in do

622
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,640
not run this in production

623
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
so

624
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,720
basically if you do

625
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
want this i'm more than happy to give it

626
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
out but you import the vm say i moved it

627
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,240
make sure the network type is bridged

628
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,559
and then once you power it on you're

629
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,720
going to have to go through and log in

630
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,279
once again it's a default credential

631
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
do not run in production

632
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
then you do

633
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,559
three commands

634
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,840
to go through and to launch the three

635
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,279
components that you or docker components

636
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,200
you need that being the database the

637
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,240
wiki and the wiki update companion

638
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,799
once you go through and spin those up i

639
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,320
usually give it about 30 minutes it's

640
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
pretty lightweight pretty nimble i go

641
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
through and i just validate

642
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
a sudo docker status and that's going to

643
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
go through and it's going to show you

644
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
how well it is going through

645
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
and or

646
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
the or it'll show you that all of the

647
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,440
docker components are up and running and

648
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,679
then you're going to need to go through

649
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,320
and find the actual ip address that your

650
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
system has so

651
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
because i'm on my laptop i don't have

652
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
that big of a screen i just use an

653
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,080
ipconfig config

654
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,559
a and grep and then i start with like

655
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,919
192 and it'll spit it right out

656
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,760
and then finally from your primary

657
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,480
system the way that you access this is

658
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
you just go through and in the web

659
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,880
browser go to http colon and then the ip

660
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,840
address

661
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,440
that your vm

662
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
has been assigned

663
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,159
once again here's some more informations

664
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,080
about it

665
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,840
and now to the live demos

666
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,679
so

667
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
i know i did not

668
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,600
but i did sacrifice a budweiser

669
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
so

670
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,480
well i had to get up here on stage so

671
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,640
when the bottle of rum comes after that

672
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
comes tonight

673
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
so

674
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,320
i already started

675
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,679
the vm pretty simple i logged in

676
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,559
with the pa or the username amarfati and

677
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,960
the password change me

678
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,840
once again do not run this in production

679
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,799
and that being said now all i have to do

680
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,559
is i'll just bring this up

681
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,279
hey it works

682
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,760
so my idea was and once again this was a

683
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
rapid prototype but what i wanted was

684
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,080
any of these boxes or the text in any of

685
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,400
these to go through and to be clickable

686
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,640
and it'd take you right to that

687
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
area now i'm not a graphics designer

688
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
but i do draw on a drawing board a lot

689
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
be it

690
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,039
physically or in vizio

691
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,840
but

692
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,159
the idea was that all of these links

693
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,760
would be directly clickable

694
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,120
and so

695
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,279
as you can see i went through and this

696
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
is how bored i got at the start of the

697
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,240
pandemic i wrote over

698
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,559
195 pages of fictitious documentation on

699
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,559
a fictitious company just to build fully

700
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,279
build this out

701
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,600
so

702
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
of course

703
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,960
indeed

704
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,039
so when i go through and let's take a

705
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,120
look at the technology stack i can go

706
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,799
through and say i want to look at how we

707
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,120
are doing our technology stack i can

708
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
come in and the major components were

709
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
bring your own device client system so

710
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
laptops cell phones that are owned by

711
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,360
the organization

712
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,720
uh cloud

713
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,679
what we're doing in the future identity

714
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,559
uh network organizational servers and

715
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,799
virtualization so let's just go through

716
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,480
for networking because

717
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,279
that's very fun and then i created a

718
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,520
document for firewall and once again

719
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,760
these were all meant that everything

720
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,120
would be clickable and take you right

721
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
where you wanted to go so we'll bring up

722
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,760
firewalls and you can see i created an

723
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,279
executive summary

724
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,080
we'd have a capabilities description

725
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,880
a scope a location the data

726
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
classification

727
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,399
the business security checklist mappings

728
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,039
the control mapping so whether this is

729
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,399
in the scope of nist or pci et cetera

730
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,360
normal contact process emergency contact

731
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,600
process who's the service or the control

732
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,840
owner who are the subject matter experts

733
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,640
so within my organization we have think

734
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
of the service owner

735
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
is that is the person that is

736
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,880
responsible to make sure that that

737
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
control is actually up it's running it's

738
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
more of a management role for the

739
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
subject matter experts those are the

740
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,080
technical experts that are hands-on

741
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,760
doing the work

742
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,240
we'd have i wanted to have a list of all

743
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,799
of the cis for that type if it's a

744
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,240
physical device

745
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,080
the technical overview so this would be

746
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
where we go through and put a link to

747
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,320
the more technical documentation that if

748
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,840
a person is authorized they could just

749
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,320
click and get in management instructions

750
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,640
you know where are their run books their

751
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
start of day start of week start a month

752
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,360
uh the how do we update say a firewall

753
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,240
rule we'd have those links and then a

754
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,559
link towards any more technical

755
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,240
documentation

756
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,760
the goal was to make sure that this was

757
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,120
that this summary was very simple very

758
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,399
approachable i wanted to it just

759
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,600
to be

760
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,440
very well defined so that

761
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,360
if we have an auditor and they say how

762
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,000
are you protecting your firewalls

763
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,679
the it's or the person that received the

764
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,919
request could come to this page just do

765
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
a control print here's a start of the

766
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,399
information of how we protect our

767
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,880
firewalls how we do this and then if the

768
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
auditor needed more we could go through

769
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,039
and justify more but one of the

770
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,320
challenges i have at an enterprise level

771
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,240
as big as we are is just

772
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,720
knowing what my colleagues are doing

773
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,360
knowing how our cloud is being

774
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,679
architected making sure that we have

775
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,960
consistent

776
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,760
identity and access management policies

777
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,000
across all of the technology that we

778
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,559
implement and that really was one of the

779
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,679
genesis that led me down setting up this

780
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,320
rapid type of a documentation

781
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,559
and actually going through and building

782
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,120
this type of a system

783
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
out for

784
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,880
our organization and one of the key

785
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,320
things to me in order to be successful

786
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,080
we need to be able to effectively

787
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,279
communicate

788
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,200
this is who we are as i t and i i.t

789
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,840
security this is how we protect the

790
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
organization these are the tools the

791
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,919
controls these are the asset types that

792
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,679
we're going through collecting

793
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:12,720
and

794
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,919
i believe

795
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,320
very much so that this type of a system

796
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,120
can help make things more open and more

797
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
transparent when we make things more

798
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,799
open and transparent i think we tell a

799
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,760
great story and we win

800
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,679
i know this was a little bit short but

801
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,240
are there any questions

802
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,399
so

803
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,039
right now we are in the start of the

804
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,279
building process once again

805
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,080
it's a very large organization but the

806
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
idea that i had for various technology

807
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,640
groups say we have one person that owns

808
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,080
how we do

809
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,880
our sim they would own their sim part

810
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,799
and then they would be required once a

811
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,279
year to go through and for formally

812
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,919
assert yes this is actually up to date

813
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,679
that's how we're starting it for those

814
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,480
groups it would be the manager for that

815
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,880
group to go through make sure that that

816
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,840
setup was correct and for the actually

817
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
policy documents that we're going

818
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,279
through and we have records for it'd be

819
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,840
the responsibility of the document owner

820
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,600
and once again they would keep that up

821
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
to date yearly at a bare minimum

822
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,720
so it's basically still a manual process

823
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,840
it's it really is a manual process it's

824
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,640
it's more about making it very

825
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,320
friendly for

826
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,880
people to go through and ingest because

827
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,279
i can't tell you how many times

828
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,360
i get somebody just

829
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,159
typing me and saying hey do you know our

830
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,679
policy on this or do you know how we

831
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,519
protect that and i can some of the times

832
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,360
i can say yes

833
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
give me a minute i'll put it on my to-do

834
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,200
list sometimes i'll come back and say no

835
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,559
but you really should reach out to this

836
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,120
person and some people even after i've

837
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,960
been with this organization for over 10

838
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,080
years i still don't know how we do x y z

839
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,880
so we are still going through and

840
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,120
generating the copious amount of

841
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,559
documentation so it's still an

842
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,200
implementation phase which is why i

843
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
spent the start of my pandemic coming up

844
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,080
with a rough poc so that i could share

845
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,159
this approach with others another

846
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,320
question

847
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,440
in the world's implementation

848
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
did you have any problems to bring

849
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,200
people import idea organization which is

850
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,960
not under cyber security

851
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
this kind of

852
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,919
organizational and political challenges

853
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,720
i wouldn't say that it's really a split

854
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,600
between it and i.t security i have a

855
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,080
very broad definition of what is i.t

856
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,440
security i think

857
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,840
if you're protecting the confidentiality

858
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
integrity or the availability of your

859
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,399
company's assets or data i think you're

860
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,239
kind of you are i.t security so i think

861
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,159
it's less so the split between it

862
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,239
security and i.t i think it's more of a

863
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,679
split

864
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,560
and

865
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,879
people don't like to do documentation i

866
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,719
want to be out doing the fun things i

867
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,480
want to be doing the sexy things i don't

868
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,918
want to be doing the nerd work

869
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,520
danielle i just think this is still a

870
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,839
lot of overlap between a good grc tool i

871
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,040
can see why a grc tool might not be

872
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,480
user friendly for the rest of the

873
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,918
organization so i'm curious how you plan

874
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,480
to integrate that back into other

875
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,040
components

876
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,199
so

877
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,280
i absolutely see what you're saying with

878
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,320
a good grc tool and we do not have

879
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,440
that fully implemented once again the

880
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,119
the bigger

881
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,839
the bigger use case for this was to

882
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,359
enable

883
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,320
internal resources to find out the basic

884
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,480
who what where when why

885
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,920
within its itnit security services

886
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
in your this can eventually have a

887
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,800
process or process

888
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,720
management or things that need to be

889
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,320
done

890
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,079
that is definitely a use

891
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,800
so the question was is that going to go

892
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,280
through and eventually have a formal

893
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,720
process

894
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,680
tied to it is that correct

895
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,599
so there's a separate project that's

896
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,680
doing this this is more just trying to

897
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,800
tell a consistent story to those

898
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,680
both i see the main use case of this is

899
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,359
to tell a consistent story to those

900
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,320
outside of it and i.t security on how we

901
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,839
do things as well as to be able to tell

902
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,079
those within i.t security

903
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,160
and i t if you wanted to know about a

904
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,480
process here's where you need to go to

905
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,400
learn the more technical details once

906
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,599
you have the approval to get that

907
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,839
documentation to more self-feed if you

908
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,078
will

909
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
most people didn't realize

910
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,240
it was supposed to be turned over to an

911
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,839
outsourced company outsourcing

912
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,920
absolutely so the statement was that uh

913
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,000
daryl had gone through and did this at a

914
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
very large organization

915
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,560
the whole ita department and at the very

916
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,760
end

917
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,400
this was or it was so that they could

918
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,280
outsource this now

919
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,520
from a point of view yes that's a risk

920
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,160
there are challenges within sourcing

921
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
there are challenges with outsourcing

922
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,040
i've worked on both sides of the house

923
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
and

924
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,480
i will say that if you do outsource

925
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,480
the better that you have

926
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,400
that you understand how your it and your

927
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,800
i.t security works

928
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
the better your managed service

929
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,560
experience is going to be

930
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,720
however i definitely go through and make

931
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,240
sure that if you are a business and you

932
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,800
are looking for outsourcing that you

933
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
understand clearly the roles and

934
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,280
responsibilities you understand the slas

935
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,320
and you make sure that those are in line

936
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,240
with your organization standards and

937
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,400
your organization's needs

938
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,640
to me the challenge is

939
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,599
i constantly have people coming and

940
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,560
saying

941
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,280
what do i need to do deploy to deploy

942
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,359
this type of technology

943
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,480
and

944
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,800
instead of going through being

945
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
aware of the various policies and

946
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,640
procedures

947
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,599
they are

948
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,000
having and being able to self-feed

949
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,520
they're having to go through and reach

950
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,440
out to others and create more work so

951
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,760
it's a lot there's a lot of

952
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,480
inefficiencies and the goal was to make

953
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,520
both

954
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,160
it and i.t security being able to better

955
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
self-feed through this type of a wiki

956
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,200
system

957
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
what's your strategy for taking the show

958
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,400
on the road within your organization

959
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,879
so

960
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,560
we are going through and building this

961
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,440
actively now and it's going to be

962
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,720
a tool where we're going to basically

963
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,359
interact with our internal marketing

964
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,760
department to go through and promote it

965
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,680
within our various sites within our

966
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,480
various communities and just use this as

967
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,680
a this is a starting point a one-on-one

968
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,520
on how to get it security services well

969
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,280
it it security services from the

970
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,200
organization so it's going to be a lot

971
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,000
of

972
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,240
socialization from

973
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,240
practitioners

974
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,960
are internal yes

975
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
so creating like little infographics and

976
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,359
putting them in strategic places within

977
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,480
existing

978
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,320
say sharepoint sites and stuff like that

979
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,280
i got a question yes how does this help

980
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,000
deal with your game

981
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
it doesn't because i gave it up because

982
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,320
that

983
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,960
that hobby is very very expensive some

984
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,200
of many of the cards that i have are

985
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,879
worth more than their weight in gold

986
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,800
any other questions

987
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,320
not

988
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,359
not this i have not seen this wiki style

989
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,320
approach to documentations elsewhere a

990
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,240
lot of what i see is

991
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,680
here's a

992
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,440
shared folder with a bunch of different

993
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,079
policies or here's a sharepoint site

994
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,640
with a bunch of policies and

995
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,119
not having a consistent

996
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,359
way in which we can go through and to

997
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,359
tell our own story i think is a

998
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,720
significant weakness for ourselves

999
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,359
accessibility cia assessment which

1000
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,720
goes back to the nist rmf framework

1001
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,599
and i just after seeing a tool

1002
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,200
i did a search

1003
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,079
are you familiar there's an xacta

1004
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,839
360

1005
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,680
tool that

1006
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,160
is being marketed our

1007
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,720
community

1008
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
to be able to capture

1009
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,520
categorized systems

1010
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,200
no i was not aware of that thank you for

1011
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,319
bringing that to my attention

1012
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,240
i remember there's another one that

1013
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,520
starts with the past but i can't

1014
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,000
remember what it is

1015
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,680
yeah i just wanted to throw together a

1016
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,480
rapid prototype because i'm not a

1017
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,160
you can clearly tell i'm not a ui

1018
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,319
designer you can totally tell i'm not a

1019
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,920
web developer

1020
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,960
so i just wanted to have something that

1021
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
i could put in front and say this is

1022
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,280
what our documentation at least our

1023
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,680
initial documentation could look like

1024
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,200
because there's

1025
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,119
i get asked a lot

1026
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,240
how and these are usually from uh

1027
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,560
management types how do we do x how do

1028
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,720
we do y how do we do z

1029
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,520
and

1030
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,359
for projects that i've worked on i

1031
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,040
usually have really good answers and

1032
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,480
really good documentation but for

1033
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,560
projects that i'm not on

1034
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,560
it may or may not be as

1035
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,040
well yeah robust and so i was trying to

1036
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
think of a way how can we make sure that

1037
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,480
we all capture the same base exactly

1038
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,680
are you trying to get back to miss

1039
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,000
controls i mean are you is that part of

1040
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,400
what you got embedded in there yeah so

1041
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,319
there was a part where we can go through

1042
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,119
and do control mappings right here

1043
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,560
and

1044
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,599
are you gonna use that to i mean can you

1045
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,680
use that to generate any kind of

1046
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,640
documentation that you might

1047
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,920
so that's a second level iteration of

1048
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,000
this type of approach i've given it some

1049
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
thought right now i'm just working on

1050
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,440
getting the actual

1051
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,760
first line

1052
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
this whole database structure of

1053
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,440
processes policy control the whole nine

1054
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,280
yards and literally just gave the

1055
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,040
auditors access to it then they

1056
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,319
that's one of the primary use cases is

1057
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,400
to go through and open this up to

1058
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,200
internal auditors for external auditors

1059
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,599
we'd expect that a munich or that a

1060
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,079
company resource would go through and

1061
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,680
interact with a company resource

1062
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,280
who could then go through and create

1063
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,760
prints or not print screens but print it

1064
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,400
to pdf

1065
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,520
but the idea is to try to

1066
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,839
have a consistent story of how we go

1067
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,000
through and define our processes our

1068
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,960
procedures uh the controls that we apply

1069
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,280
to our different asset types in a clear

1070
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,599
and consistent way so that we are

1071
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,200
able to go through

1072
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,800
and to defend this is what we're doing

1073
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,319
and this is why we're doing it as i t

1074
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,079
and i t security improve value

1075
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,760
any other questions

1076
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,680
there's a critical need for this just

1077
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,920
all the the questions and comments that

1078
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,119
have come up here

1079
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,040
and i i appreciate your comment you're

1080
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,839
not a new live designer but tapping into

1081
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,119
a wiki

1082
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,800
having referenceable information you've

1083
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,280
got a framework here a foundation that

1084
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,359
uh when you get to another phase where

1085
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,880
you're pulling in uh

1086
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,359
right you lay down some apis to some of

1087
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,920
the sources you're tapping into you can

1088
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,680
automate some of this validation start

1089
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,160
bleeding into that grc space but to

1090
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,400
danielle's point you know making this

1091
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,119
accessible to the people yes the

1092
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,560
wizardry i'm going to come back because

1093
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,640
i'm a huge magic fan myself thank you

1094
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,440
started playing the 93. um

1095
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,000
you you take that uh that secrecy

1096
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,720
working in information security and the

1097
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,400
thing that makes it scary for all the

1098
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,319
people we work with and you're making it

1099
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,400
less scary and that's a big deal i

1100
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,720
really like this well thank you i this

1101
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,800
is one this is my least technical talk

1102
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
that i've ever put together so i'm a

1103
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,240
little bit outside of my comfort zone

1104
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,680
thank you for letting me beta test it

1105
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,560
here with you

1106
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,240
i know i went a little bit fast but i

1107
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,920
think you're more interested in the i.t

1108
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,280
security side than the magic the

1109
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,599
gathering side but danielle i saw you i

1110
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,119
was thinking it would be really cool to

1111
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,200
have like a little video embedded in it

1112
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,440
like a 30 second why why is this

1113
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,040
technology important oh

1114
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
i'm you know the absolutely user click

1115
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,800
on that i'm gonna watch the video it's

1116
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,280
30 seconds long that's that's my speed

1117
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,400
right there i'm going to read all that

1118
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,640
stuff oh absolutely that could be an

1119
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,640
easy add-on but the idea is to move the

1120
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,960
documentation into a consistent way to

1121
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,200
digitize it and to make it easily

1122
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,359
accessible to everyone and that really

1123
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,520
you know was the heart this was

1124
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,000
just a rapid well not so rapid proof of

1125
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,839
concept because i wouldn't

1126
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,880
because honestly i built out every one

1127
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,640
of the

1128
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,280
topics so sim knack vulnerability

1129
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,640
scanners you know

1130
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,800
i have active content for a fictitious

1131
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,839
company on each one of those

1132
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,880
any other questions

1133
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,839
thank you very much

1134
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,219
[Applause]
