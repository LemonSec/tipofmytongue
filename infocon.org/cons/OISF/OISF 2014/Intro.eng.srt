35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,470
to buy cake unlike Black Mesa the cake

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,450
is not a lie when you come to isf

37
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,680
requirements of you guys is to

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,619
contribute knowledge to participate in

39
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,360
discussion so especially if one of our

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,340
speakers today it's up here and ask

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,950
questions don't make them feel awkward I

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,630
think most of our speakers are

43
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,070
experienced enough they will just sit

44
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,119
here until you respond so so make sure

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,820
you participate in the discussion and

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,878
then share your expertise it is only as

47
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,730
good as you make it presenter

48
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,590
for our monthly presentations we need

49
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,530
presenters anywhere from five minutes to

50
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,440
60 minutes to beyond this is our user

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,500
group so if you don't participate you'll

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,569
have to listen to myself Ravi or Tom

53
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,269
speak every month and that gets old for

54
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,760
you guys so I'm going to steal a little

55
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,709
from Evan booth who we had talked last

56
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,349
month it was phenomenal print who always

57
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,870
here last month for Evan boos fantastic

58
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,220
presentation right we've got to play

59
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,519
with robots things got blown up on video

60
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,129
hit build weapons out of the

61
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:50,530
Constitution it was amazing great

62
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,290
presentation but I loved part of his

63
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,390
presentation talked about creativity how

64
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,640
we're all really creative even though

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,590
most of us especially an IT say I'm not

66
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,900
that creative but when you pointed out

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,359
is everyone's creative when you have a

68
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:06,549
dream at night you're not sitting at

69
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,920
your desk filing paperwork you're riding

70
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,430
a unicorn on a rainbow and fighting

71
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,000
dragons all of us are creative and we

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,690
run into this block it seems like that

73
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,669
that will hit ideas novela well I'm not

74
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,139
that creative and then the idea is just

75
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,669
go out the window so I want to encourage

76
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,230
you especially as we talk about

77
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,410
presenters use your creativity everybody

78
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,680
has it Wow somebody's speaking up here

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,870
if somebody says something and sparks an

80
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,450
idea jot it down or file it away and

81
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,760
research it and come back to us and

82
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,060
present on that idea if Darryl's up here

83
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,889
presenting and you're watching and

84
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,780
present in your life and Darryl's

85
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,669
mustache is epic then you start thinking

86
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,950
about handlebars and you like dude

87
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,630
handlebars are pretty cool and man I

88
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,329
should go biking and hey there's cake so

89
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:57,010
I really need to go biking to burn off

90
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,280
the cake I don't know where that's going

91
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,470
necessarily because it kind of stops at

92
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,660
cake but do something like that if

93
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,400
something sparks an interest well a

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,440
speaker is presenting about a concept or

95
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,019
an idea follow that down the road and

96
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,479
make a presentation based off of that

97
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,339
sponsorship so so there is no monthly

98
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,459
fee that we charge so sponsors are the

99
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,510
way we get food for you guys

100
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,780

119
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,950
couple of days ago this morning at

120
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,780

121
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,710
our speakers that he's in London so if

122
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,180
you're familiar with geography all

123
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,440
London is not here and so he's not going

124
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,100
to make it but we do have a speaker

125
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,480

126
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,070
going to fill in and talk about modern

127
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,290
