1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
as the presenter this morning email as

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,879
he's still in London England on london

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,429
ohio and so that i was going to make

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,519
presented here difficult so tom has a

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,250
presentation he threw together that he's

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,289
going to give us on modern times too

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,990
clear on passwords so give it up for Tom

8
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:26,550
now this one usually runs a little short

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,330
and I know you're all just absolutely

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,239
angry because you need to stay away from

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,250
that cake so passwords first I'm Tom I

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,399
look fancy I've got websites twitter

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,160
google+ whatever I also walk around a

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,750
lot so that came up from enough gonna

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,949
follow me if you want to get a hold of

16
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,390
me I'm everywhere across the internet so

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,230
in essence the password is home how long

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,729
have we been using passwords yeah I mean

19
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,979
you can go back to the speakeasies you

20
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,740
can go back in for that yeah nice and

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,549
low what's the password balls all right

22
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,590
here it it wasn't into the bar and you

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,080
like a good time but we've learned a lot

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,049
right we can't just use bubbles as the

25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,759
password that's simply not good enough

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,710
especially not when we can guess a

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,229
thousand passwords a second on the

28
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,460
slogan so here are the bad guys here are

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,990
the things that we have to watch out for

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,400
here's the things that are trying to

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,560
make our world more insecure or more

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,650
inconvenient probably the biggest the

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,850
most comment is a wordless attack you

34
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,979
saw Dave Kennedy take a look at you know

35
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,049
certain password certain user behaviors

36
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,780
and how he's trying to use education to

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,490
fix those will go into that a little bit

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,659
later but if you teach people to use

39
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,610
really bad passwords like the name of

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,350
the dog plus the year or the season plus

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,919
the year it's a really bad password what

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,300
a worthless attacked us for those who

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,990
don't know is it

44
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,570
it's the most commonly used passwords

45
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,830
foots about the phone the last and says

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,600
okay we're going to try those first

47
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,190
we're just going to run through the list

48
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,760
and you'll get about half of them in

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,200
most organizations the next thing is and

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,240
it's not really commonly used unless

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,830
you're trying to crack something that

52
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,140
you've stolen locally as a brute force

53
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,450
attack you literally just run through

54
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,010
every combination of characters that

55
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,990
could possibly exist for a given

56
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,410
language and Hopi cracks on very slow

57
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,460
you never use it in an actual attack per

58
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,100
se if you're doing something remotely

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,080
it's just too slow too noisy come on

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,300
ical attacks this is getting more common

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,660
in the internet if you use the same

62
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,940
password for Twitter that you use for

63
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,090
your exchange admin you're going to have

64
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,700
a bad day but LinkedIn links your

65
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,260
password and a happens through you're

66
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,470
going an admin account I it's game over

67
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,080
at that point you shouldn't really reuse

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,460
passwords but we keep telling people

69
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,220
this but they keep doing it and that's

70
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,040
kind of our fault I'm going to some of

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,640
the things that you know people in IT do

72
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,290
people like me people like my

73
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,300
organization so you're going to have all

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,070
these characters and scad to be this

75
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,830
long and people make one really good

76
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,200
password that hits the majority of their

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,180
size when we use a permanent thing it's

78
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,610
bad but it's our fault that they're

79
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,530
doing it forgetting passwords here's

80
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,000
something that people don't really think

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,130
of as you know part of your standard set

82
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,590
of bad guys if people are forgetting

83
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,180
their passwords they're going to make

84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,890
simple at once plain and simple they're

85
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,030
going to make one's easier to remember

86
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,460
they're going to have passwords doc on

87
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,290
their desktop or they're going to be

88
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,210
scribbling sticky notes all over the

89
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,190
place check under the keyboard it's

90
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,350
always under the keyboard always things

91
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,570
that make a good password we've got

92
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,980
entropy which is jumbling up characters

93
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,660
it's the randomness inherent in a

94
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,310
password if your password is ABCD it's

95
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,510
pretty easy to make

96
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,550
program to enumerate that to get the

97
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,030
password easily if it's got more entropy

98
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,440
it's going to be harder to crack and

99
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
it's all pretty easy stuff but we'll get

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,820
into the better stuff in a bit and we're

101
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
a good thing I don't really like to just

102
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,440
sit up here to be a talking hat please

103
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,540
interrupt me I like having a

104
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,370
conversation when I do just talking

105
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,560
length is definitely the most important

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,940
thing when it comes to passwords and

107
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,270
we're starting to see organizations

108
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,340
value length over complexity over

109
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,620
certain rule sets and even take away

110
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,140
password rules as the password gets

111
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,300
longer it's a really novel concept

112
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,940
national leads to much much happier

113
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,830
users in much better passwords way

114
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,180
better security and again uniqueness

115
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,250
don't reuse passwords it's just a bad

116
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,550
idea so here are some brute force times

117
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,850
at a relatively modest a thousand

118
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,550
guesses per second this is assuming you

119
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,970
know no knockouts no compensated control

120
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,970
if you just have a slow network

121
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,910
connection in your attacking a system

122
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,230
this is what it would take to guess

123
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,120
these passwords now here's some cool

124
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,880
stuff because you use different

125
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,540
characters you've got 10 posture denied

126
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,430
possible characters or 10 possible

127
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,960
characters if you're using just numbers

128
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,010
right so the list of possible passwords

129
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,820
is a lot shorter than if you include

130
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,480
letters and then upper case and symbols

131
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,610
and just keeps getting bigger the bigger

132
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:15,210
your wool sentence so yes you listing of

133
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,070
all those times then does that factor in

134
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:27,720
any any job any comment assets or does

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,340
it just assume no password is talk no

136
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,040
this is just straight-up really dumb

137
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,020
brute forcing there's no intelligence

138
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,960
this list as you can see in the bottom

139
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,120
two examples just by adding one more

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
character you can make a password way

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,199
way harder to brute force but it's it's

142
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,629
not about brute forcing right so someone

143
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,810
tell me and raise your hands which of

144
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,879
these is more security which of these

145
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,440
passwords one considers who's refugees

146
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,360
the bottom of obviously more complex

147
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,340
like I told you it has presentation the

148
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,199
only company I wasn't able to break into

149
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,030
was the company where all their

150
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:36,990
employees and preachers exactly so again

151
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,110
one more character makes your attacks

152
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,630
way more difficult you don't need

153
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,710
complexity for security you just don't

154
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,960
this the general gist of this

155
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,849
presentation is more of a look at the

156
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,349
social component the human component the

157
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:58,270
squishy component of security how we can

158
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,639
make the humans better at what humans do

159
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,819
well not a lot but make them a little

160
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,389
better at what they do poorly people

161
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,150
won't remember this if you say well my

162
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,069
passwords a name of my dog and I just

163
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,419
hit zero nine times okay all right

164
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,370
that's that's okay that's way better

165
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,169
because you're not running down a

166
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,419
password you're not going to use it for

167
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,180
Twitter and Facebook and your email

168
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,520
account and your work email account and

169
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,490
all this other stuff so here's a couple

170
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,169
things this is what we tell people to do

171
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,120
we told to use a password manager we

172
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,059
tell them to your log into lastpass of

173
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,659
one password he passed or whatever

174
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,040
anything on earth just to make something

175
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,260
long complex just don't use your

176
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,190
mother's maiden name

177
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,230
fast with anything and then this is what

178
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,960
they do everyone does this right so so

179
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,100
how many people work I tea or InfoSec

180
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,750
probably did the majority of the room

181
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,030
great how many times do you see that

182
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,380
password probably a fair amount you know

183
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,420
some combination of something and then

184
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,870
some numbers I mean it's a basic it's

185
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,080
the default word list in everything if

186
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,490
so it says hey let's make a word list

187
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,900
and crack some passwords you start with

188
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,240
word then some numbers that's how you

189
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,890
build a word list that's rule number one

190
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,170
that password doesn't hold up over time

191
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
here's here's what users do and this is

192
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,120
all of our bulbs so of course the first

193
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,380
one common word some numbers the second

194
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,400
one is really really common as Darrell

195
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,920
likes to point out you all can change

196
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,920
your passwords to summer 2014 because

197
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,780
we're now officially in summer so

198
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,449
prepare yourselves for fall 2014 I

199
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,550
probably shouldn't say this on camera my

200
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,650
company half of the people Jesus

201
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,750
password because I haven't been able to

202
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,460
break them yet it's bad it's it's really

203
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,950
bad and it's all our fault because they

204
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,620
say hey you've got to have something

205
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,960
that's at least 10 characters long

206
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,030
you've got to have capitals you got to

207
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,180
have numbers and you have to change it

208
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,950
every 90 days oh that's convenient or

209
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,420
you have to change every month we'll

210
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,070
just use the love I know people that

211
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,270
every month it's you know august 2013

212
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,390
and then their first name that's the

213
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,130
password and this happens a lot do you

214
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,960
guys see this if I'm able one who sees

215
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,210
this everyone seen their right so I kind

216
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,830
of other common ones and the third

217
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,760
example isn't horrible it's bad but it's

218
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,530
not the worst thing I've seen at least

219
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,800
augusta me punctuation in there and of

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,150
course the bottom is abysmal

221
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,180
I see that a lot I see user initials

222
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,590
plus some numerical version of gear plus

223
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:20,220
month that happens upon them we did this

224
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,350
and a lot of government organizations

225
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,740
mandate password changes to comply with

226
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,410
various regulations and that's a real

227
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,280
damn shame we are causing bad security

228
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,250
practices by forcing people to not just

229
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,430
choose a really good password from the

230
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,350
get-go and say yeah you can stick with

231
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,630
it have that one be done I also the VPN

232
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,700
happen at my company we've got RSA

233
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,490
tokens they all need a pin they say

234
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,960
they'll have to change the center in

235
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,660
loan I say no choose one that six

236
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,200
characters long and I won't even look

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,580
twice at it you will never have to

238
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,100
change it long as I'm in charge of this

239
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,510
they pick something crazy complex they

240
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,520
don't pick their birthday I mean I run

241
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,010
the system I know what they pick because

242
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,600
our essay isn't very good at not few

243
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,510
skating user data but they pick

244
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,390
something that's to me seemingly random

245
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,410
to them memorable complex will use it as

246
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,300
two factors of the risk is pretty far

247
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,400
mitigated that line and this is pretty

248
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,630
controversial forced password changes

249
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,230
decrease security they don't do anything

250
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,250
they don't help anyone ever except one

251
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,420
very tiny tiny case if a piece of

252
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,920
malware gets on your system and it's

253
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,200
using a password and it needs to use

254
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,240
your password for a very long extended

255
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,580
period of time that's when a force

256
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,530
password change would really affect

257
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,010
anything but you basically got if given

258
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,990
a piece of malware if you get an

259
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,970
attacker we trying to compromise your

260
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,100
system and he hits your password see you

261
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,800
like yep got that password that I've got

262
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,480
90 days to kick back no well he's going

263
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,379
to take your past

264
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,239
he's going to root your company is going

265
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,859
to get on your domain server he's going

266
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,410
to wreak havoc he's going to take all

267
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,539
your data instantly it's not going to

268
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,399
sit around and wait because he knows

269
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,169
well I've got you know maybe 60 days

270
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,899
maybe 60 whole days to use this password

271
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,849
this is great now he's going to get his

272
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,349
work done real quick malware is going to

273
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:40,569
get its work done real quick the only

274
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,249
thing forcing people to change their

275
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:44,829
password does is it forces them to make

276
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:48,519
really really bad passwords you know

277
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,939
like these horrible awful passwords

278
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:54,579
because it fits in so nicely it hits all

279
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,649
the complexity rules and gets I tee off

280
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,509
your back and lets you get some damn

281
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,689
work done and you can apply it every

282
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:04,509
single password change because it always

283
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:08,829
works that's that's terrible we

284
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,779
shouldn't do that so what can we do

285
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,939
right we do the only thing that makes

286
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,939
sense and it's really hard to do right

287
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:20,919
you can't do this and straight up Active

288
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,869
Directory you're going to have some

289
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:24,699
add-on somewhere and Linux you can do

290
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,979
anything but an Active Directory being a

291
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,929
little bit harder to extend you've got

292
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,709
to have a custom module great password

293
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,579
shouldn't expire what makes a great

294
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:39,909
password and yet some people are that

295
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,669
throw things at me at this talk so thank

296
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:46,199
you for not but what do you guys think

297
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,899
that's worth so well yeah you should use

298
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,139
a passphrase yes up a unicode characters

299
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,029
i think you can't actually tighten up

300
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:58,269
yes it windows me too probably woman at

301
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:05,039
least the gluten characters mmm Greggy

302
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,949
anyone else no yeah I'm just here a

303
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,399
binary awful bit with anything is

304
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,629
laughable I believe the easy communities

305
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,569
PHP is in parsi could sing wait that's a

306
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,329
ski I think we can we can discount that

307
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,470
advice because PHP

308
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,260
I'm just in it I also write PHP I

309
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,410
understand your pain that's awesome

310
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,910
unfortunately for compliance there

311
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,100
somewhere doesn't matter how we got

312
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,100
River where regulators clients changed

313
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,200
your mind right which means it'll never

314
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,360
happen sorry the movie compliance is

315
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,580
never going to change well here is given

316
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,310
by H best practices all right that

317
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,070
Piazza where are you ECI as best

318
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,180
practices and we would never use yeah

319
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,860
well it's a good thing that target

320
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,100
implemented pci right yeah great job

321
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,950
great job totally save everyone a lot

322
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,780
out all of you have seen this this is

323
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,490
very Commons going around the internet

324
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,460
it's the famous XKCD the correct horse

325
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,570
battery stable and where randall Munroe

326
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,620
points out very lovingly that the quick

327
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,240
thing we've done in infosec in IT

328
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,790
security quality as we've made people

329
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,770
choose passwords that are easy for

330
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,720
computers to guess and hard for us to

331
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,080
remember that's what we've accomplished

332
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,850
the good news is we can fix that it's

333
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,190
not impossible we just have to change

334
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,340
our thinking a little bit correct words

335
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,080
battery sable isn't a bad ass but i

336
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,150
wouldn't use that exact one I'm sure

337
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,710
it's are plenty of other much that's

338
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:57,320
inside but it's not that I mean from a

339
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,790
password standpoint that's actually

340
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,810
pretty good the moral of the story is is

341
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,569
longer his back always that's what she

342
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,410
said it is we should be listening right

343
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,810
longer is always better and if she said

344
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,190
Barnes that's a clue discussion of get

345
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,569
work off white characters we can do this

346
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,780
sure it happens dirty I don't know any

347
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,700
word list that has a unicode characters

348
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,710
on that side from other languages

349
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,780
but passphrases passphrases non-defining

350
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,910
passphrases as a password that's greater

351
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,470
than 16 characters in length now just to

352
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,210
see what type of reaction you would get

353
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,520
go up to you know your your CTL go up to

354
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,970
upper management go to someone in sales

355
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,350
and say yeah I was thinking about making

356
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,800
password 16 characters long you will

357
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,750
either be laughed out of the building or

358
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,460
thrown out of the building one of the

359
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,450
two will happen i recently tried to try

360
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,130
to implement this new policy at my

361
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,010
company and it was a combination of the

362
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,960
two they were laughing and throwing

363
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,280
still try very difficult but people

364
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,040
assume the worst people assume okay so

365
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,660
you've got to have a Hebrew word 37

366
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,090
characters a couple unicode characters

367
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,340
spaces wide characters and some form a

368
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,840
book that this weird an author wrote in

369
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,560
your password and it people always

370
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,480
assume the worst the thing people can

371
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,340
start making when you have really long

372
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,380
passwords as they can make correct horse

373
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,990
battery stable in all lowercase if add

374
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,610
spaces that's even better they don't

375
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,020
have to we need to start making rules

376
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,830
that take this into account now other

377
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,140
places are starting to do this most

378
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,040
notably Sanford then it's not only

379
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,690
Stanford Stanford made the news but

380
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,100
there was actually a university that did

381
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,680
this before them a couple of them so

382
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,540
we're starting to see this in education

383
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,070
this may be the news because Stanford is

384
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,340
giant this is their password rules all

385
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,120
wrapped up in a nice neat infographic

386
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,590
gotta be at least eight characters you

387
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,960
can't go below that but if you make

388
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
something that's 20 or more characters

389
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
don't even worry about capital letters

390
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,250
they don't care the complexity rules the

391
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,700
requirements for a password shrink as

392
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,940
the password gets longer because we're

393
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,809
looking at wordlist when you're looking

394
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,720
brute force tools when you're in the 8

395
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,049
to 11 character range having a good word

396
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:50,230
list a really good word list can still

397
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,710
sink a password it's difficult with all

398
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,070
of those sets it's not impossible for

399
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,460
20-plus characters as long as you stay

400
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,620
away from common phrases common song

401
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,559
lyrics in bible verses then you can you

402
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,490
can do that that's one of the things one

403
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,840
of the pieces of analysis that's been

404
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,539
done after this change happened as they

405
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,269
said hey just about everyone is using

406
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:22,049
some form of bible verse or Beatles song

407
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,039
those are going to start getting word

408
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,019
list and we have to solve that so as

409
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,690
long as you have a block list in place

410
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,909
it makes for a good password again I've

411
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:33,340
use of word monkey it's on a word list

412
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,869
it's going to be the first one hit if

413
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,960
you use it's been a hard day's night as

414
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,539
your passphrase it's kind of beyond a

415
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,259
word list it's going to be hit there's a

416
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,600
thing with that too Tom I mean when you

417
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,559
have passwords that 8 to 15 character to

418
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,110
other characters the size of dictionary

419
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,470
that you need to enumerate all

420
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,480
possibilities is much larger than the

421
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,919
size of the dictionary for something

422
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,950
that's 20 characters oh yeah I'm

423
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,169
downloaded 10 character rainbow tables

424
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:08,230
and it wasn't the most fun I've ever had

425
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,470
oh come on everybody yeah still I mean

426
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,629
it's a huge difference I think I had a

427
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:15,580
dictionary there's like 13 gigs I don't

428
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,320
remember what all that covered but I

429
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,909
believe it went up to 16 characters

430
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,759
again not fallible possibilities still

431
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,549
13 gigs if I had a dictionary that

432
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,279
covered 20 characters plus totally

433
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,009
headed to Peppa bites yeah and God

434
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,990
forbid they thrown a capital letter in

435
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,409
fact there's a lot of storage it really

436
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,090
in we can live passwords we can't just

437
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,190
keep doing this we are going in circles

438
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,029
yes

439
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,010
you're opening yourself up to different

440
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:35,390
factors that's a good point to consider

441
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,490
Oh patty on top of that has a 20-plus

442
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,620
character password and you think oh yeah

443
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,870
if it's more than 20 characters it's

444
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,330
just one deep hi there you have string

445
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,670
characters or astral just a string of

446
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,430
words instead of guessing ABC you're

447
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,850
guessing correct Apple corrects baby

448
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,360
correct whatever what have you instead

449
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,900
of conventional reports I mean where we

450
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,630
go from there right right and I there's

451
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,970
no secret to it the password by

452
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,490
implementing visuals we are just pushing

453
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,860
the wheel further a little bit we're

454
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,450
going to have the exact same problems

455
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,910
for historic is cheaper network is

456
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,700
faster processor gets faster we're not

457
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,650
solving any problems this is the way to

458
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,000
push the problem down the road a little

459
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,610
bit there are people who are interested

460
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,950
in solving the password problem this

461
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,530
doesn't solve any of that it's true

462
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,090
people are going to write word lists

463
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,080
they're going to be different attacks

464
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,620
based on having giant passwords right

465
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,690
because there's a lot of real complexity

466
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,900
to it there's a decent out processing to

467
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,940
it they're not ask analysis on the

468
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,440
Gradle too yeah a lot of people who

469
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,490
analyze the statistics of the passwords

470
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,850
that are actually getting hit the

471
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,000
different words inside of those yeah

472
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,120
it's I worthless will be built I mean

473
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,080
this is not immune to a word list attack

474
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,590
if if they're constructed well it hurts

475
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,600
it and it makes it more annoying for a

476
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,610
worthless attacked happens and as we

477
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,350
know in security especially security at

478
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,889
scale it's the objective is not to be

479
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,179
invincible because you'll never

480
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,919
accomplish that the objective is to make

481
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,600
yourself the smallest target possible

482
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,980
and if someone says oh man 20 character

483
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,879
word list do you know i'm i'm just going

484
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:33,000
to hit the 16s we're done with that i'm

485
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,289
going to hit that two ain't character

486
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,519
passwords so hard you fought for the

487
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,320
turf of the light and I think the

488
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,850
assumption is that one could repeat a

489
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,970
brute force as often as one way so

490
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,820
second characteristic that would be you

491
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,350
have a rule about timeouts after failure

492
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,379
and a third principle for me do you have

493
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:03,779
access Adam to the hash and so if you

494
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:06,659
have access to the hash then it's only a

495
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,320
matter of how long under these new

496
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,049
high-powered CPU as it takes bill

497
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:18,929
rainbow table or generate multiply so I

498
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:20,970
forgot what the stats from the earlier

499
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,799
speaker was 93 can because 19 good

500
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,789
question that became 10 million so what

501
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,070
does it is does that turn into attend

502
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,500
character rainbow table that

503
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,110
approximately the truth villages what'll

504
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,659
film keep in mind rainbow tables get

505
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,259
pretty gigantic after 12 characters with

506
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:46,139
your your full set now that's the point

507
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:49,590
of making is that your table earlier is

508
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,720
very small yes so it if

509
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,049
our characters the number of characters

510
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,010
for seconds we generate a chin carrier

511
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,460
rate with table and 24 hours per day if

512
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,980
you want to look out for sure if so that

513
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,610
you don't even need that storage holder

514
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,220
right right you just one through it you

515
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,630
don't even care about storing values

516
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,490
because you can anywhere eat it fast and

517
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,490
operational so so let's meet if you're

518
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,870
going to make your point about keeping

519
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,570
transport it's simple you have to assume

520
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,650
that the hash is not available right

521
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,380
yeah that's a different copy as well

522
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,210
yeah this is he protecting those things

523
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,789
I hope that if the action directly

524
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:38,690
available did not look any different

525
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:46,530
they take it on well but but so as far

526
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,679
as an attacker obtaining a copy of your

527
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,330
password database or getting a list of

528
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,140
hatches the only thing this this doesn't

529
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,760
make any difference you're entirely

530
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,860
right this doesn't help that attack at

531
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,289
all it doesn't mitigate anything it

532
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,700
might make it a little bit more annoying

533
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,400
for a little bit longer but not very

534
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,909
much it was not enough it wouldn't stop

535
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:12,240
anyone right the only thing that will

536
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,700
prevent that attack is by using eight

537
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,380
secure hashing algorithm to store your

538
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,070
passwords password based key derivation

539
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:26,220
function bcrypt for instance if so i got

540
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,500
a list of md5 passwords not even salted

541
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,000
just straight up ND functions like hell

542
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,690
this is fun throw him into a rainbow

543
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,169
table and got back done i also got a

544
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:42,630
list of bcrypt passwords that's at all

545
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,120
right so I tasked out a machine on

546
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,840
amazon ec2 to go crack booze I let it

547
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,700
run for 24 hours ended up with one pass

548
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,740
travel

549
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,440
as long as you do in that attack while

550
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,900
Ian's the technology implements a secure

551
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,400
a she offered them there's not a lot you

552
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,900
have to worry about there's still some

553
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,640
because if they're trying to practice

554
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,750
one password especially if that person

555
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,880
has reused a password and that services

556
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,860
using a really bad ashen algorithm they

557
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,340
can reuse it so as long as all service

558
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,480
of start implementing security

559
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,550
operatives it minimizes the attack

560
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,510
vector by a huge amount decrypt is one

561
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,540
of the ones that you can't see realize

562
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,550
that even if you throw in GPU power read

563
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,730
it doesn't do a whole lot to speed

564
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,400
things up doesn't roll bit but not on

565
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,670
the level that you would see in char md5

566
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,430
or hash algorithms built for speeding so

567
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,970
vote for security so yeah you're right

568
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,770
so if you want to take the hashing piece

569
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,590
off the table for the next most

570
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,410
important thing is the timeout after

571
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,680
failure yes and once you put that on the

572
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,270
table then what we are calculating is if

573
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,870
it's a ten-second or however long I'm

574
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,910
home tempted how long would it take to

575
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,170
brute-force rainbow table they look over

576
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,320
excuse me brute force a sixth period or

577
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,950
passing right and that's why we have

578
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,290
this slide and then the next one but

579
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,580
this one first account walkouts often

580
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,220
used to dissuade brute force attacks and

581
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,550
it doesn't work but a lot of IT

582
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,850
organizations deploy or set their

583
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,330
account lockout rules incorrectly this

584
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,390
means if a person you know if their

585
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,970
password if you have a proxy that it

586
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,980
uses user credentials login to get

587
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,810
people to the internet fairly common

588
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,960
when Chris and password expires windows

589
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,500
says hey log out log back in you need to

590
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,570
change your password but just like out

591
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,130
whatever they click the X and then they

592
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,990
try to Google something and they just

593
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,400
keep hitting refresh because the thing

594
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,900
won't come up because the proxies got

595
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,660
the wrong

596
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,610
those may just locked out their kennel

597
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,590
we can avoid that by I mean hopefully

598
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,870
don't have refresh 30 or 50 times they

599
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:17,200
might but setting a lock out of say you

600
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:25,230
know 30 to 50 incorrect attempts I

601
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,290
didn't I didn't want to so so in the

602
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,470
cases in your case if they possible

603
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,170
across the entire environment is I don't

604
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,970
have employees you got more employees

605
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,110
you got with 30 and 40 temps and you

606
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,470
probably have let me try to give min

607
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,600
thresholds reason to discover so i can

608
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,730
easily go against a couple of counts

609
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,720
figure out walk out is I think I've got

610
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,940
the answer to that further slides and

611
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,800
then I can build one tire brute force

612
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,410
attack followed with your stats the

613
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,520
basis that their run brother the day

614
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,710
it's it might not be the right answer I

615
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,810
think I've got the answer to that to

616
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:20,590
another slide well I mean if your

617
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,060
servers are randomly rebooting in a

618
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,470
production environment and you should

619
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,260
probably know what's going on that's

620
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,330
just me that come from asus has a point

621
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,700
of view if my server randomly reboots

622
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,220
I'm not just gonna go five server

623
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,830
rebooted randomly found a ton of things

624
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,080
wrong so if you're in soldier because it

625
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,630
might open sets of security video

626
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,210
release you know lockout exactly yeah

627
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,400
yeah in most organizations set this way

628
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,510
too low I get the idea I think this is a

629
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,470
better solution right and that's the

630
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,570
solution to your issue but most places

631
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,490
don't do that and you can only have let

632
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,720
this if you've got some sort of scanning

633
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,330
she's loving others reality so what did

634
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,510
he do so oddity automated oddity content

635
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,289
right so the other exactly exactly thats

636
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:18,760
you said if you said quote up and

637
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,850
certainly observes okay you should still

638
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,710
see the Pierces em and you see here

639
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,280
things fail like that right it's still

640
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,809
pretty noisy and if they've got a

641
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,210
monitoring system on the backhand it's

642
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,770
probably setting off some alarms not

643
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,419
depending on the organization they might

644
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:40,990
not have one and they might not care

645
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:47,360
custom here computer issues yeah so my

646
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,919
thinking is lockouts yeah we can have on

647
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,330
you know set to 30 seconds to a minute

648
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,669
to try to dissuade brute force attacks

649
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:00,260
why not just slow things down

650
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,440
progressively let us say hey look you

651
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,470
get 5 10 tries on a password and then

652
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,940
you gotta wait 10 seconds before you try

653
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,250
another one you get five more incorrect

654
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,559
okay we'll just add 30 seconds and then

655
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,090
you ask away from there up to a point

656
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,760
right you don't want it lock someone out

657
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,740
for eternity and say well you've got to

658
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,690
wait the next 60 years long to log into

659
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,900
your tail but i think this is better

660
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,450
than an account lockout especially if

661
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,730
there's a user interface I want to

662
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,890
impress a'n't to tell me user hey you

663
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,000
can't do that you're doing it too much

664
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,159
custom modules it you can't do it in

665
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,429
straight active directory it annoys me

666
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:47,179
he's service all damn day yes I use that

667
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:48,860
on my linux systems along I haven't had

668
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:56,870
one of those even morosely the amount of

669
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,610
time reaching me

670
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,420
whatever you're storing that value

671
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,340
reaches the maximum value of that type

672
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,639
also reaching the maximum value of the

673
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,109
lockout time no I mean lockout time

674
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:18,699
increases of what we're can't increase

675
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,550
any further oh yeah when you accept that

676
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,520
something unreasonably high right so if

677
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,250
you had to wait 30 minutes to throw

678
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,739
another password to your brute force

679
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,899
engine they would probably stop things

680
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:34,840
mostly dead depending on scale is what

681
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,659
I'm saying is I'm having would that

682
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:48,010
actually someone just again just making

683
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,690
that limit increase so I so fast you

684
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,070
could definitely get off management or

685
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,840
even yeah you could prevent someone for

686
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,960
long if if that was the goal on the your

687
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:25,270
question no that's true that's true and

688
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,050
this really only works in in enterprise

689
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,270
environment during an environment where

690
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,580
you've got monitoring to get a sec team

691
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,440
you get an ops team you've got an IT

692
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,750
team watching these things for home user

693
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,910
you know they've got nothing I mean you

694
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,380
could yank someone's internet connection

695
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,720
for a fan and they might call time or me

696
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,060
might wait for it to come back and they

697
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:59,710
might plug the router six times yeah I

698
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,640
should have made that clear yeah this is

699
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,770
doesn't I still think longer passwords

700
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,890
are good but disabling account lockout

701
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,259
universally probably isn't the best idea

702
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:35,310
right there or they have kind of for

703
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,460
rails applications that general perceive

704
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,290
the best practices through a chemical

705
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,050
devise and if your account gets locked

706
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,990
out or time Dale you can click something

707
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,790
similar to a reset password link and it

708
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,800
gives you a one-time off code that's

709
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,540
good for an hour and then you click that

710
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,250
says okay you're clear to log in now

711
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,619
please put in your password so something

712
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:00,940
like that would alleviate that issue but

713
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,350
I think slowing things down is probably

714
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,869
the better answer I think it would be

715
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,880
more effective and less disruptive than

716
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,920
walk out and that's really the whole

717
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,400
point is to make it hurt password

718
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,040
attacks without necessarily hurting a

719
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,770
user who's just dumb because we have

720
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:22,420
those they exist in none of this means

721
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,369
anything without some sort of monitoring

722
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:26,650
tool without a bunch of interns watching

723
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,500
logs without some sort of red flag like

724
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,320
Enterprise style Red Alert thing going

725
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,020
off saying hey someone's doing something

726
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,030
and a bunch of accounts are trying to

727
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,090
get access to rapidly you should prob as

728
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,160
look at this you should probably unplug

729
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,580
your Ethernet cables if you don't do

730
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,450
that if if there is no account lockout

731
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,930
if you're not even slowing things down

732
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,760
it's worthless I mean you probably

733
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,020
should be out at that point oh so you

734
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,070
get a book in terms watch your walls he

735
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,470
would entered what you the way I see it

736
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,980
there's enough interns in the world does

737
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,680
take like a tin of like a hundred and

738
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,920
twenty interns

739
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
watch the screen and stuff scrolls by

740
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:31,220
it'll catch enough one thing this

741
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,770
doesn't help you could have a slow burn

742
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,120
on brute force attack I don't know if

743
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,010
anyone's going to really be that

744
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,450
persistent but if someone's persistent

745
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,490
enough to hate your box every 30 minutes

746
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,010
or every hour trying to get a password

747
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,370
out of it they're gonna be really

748
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,260
persistent there's not a lot you can do

749
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,870
to stop that you can lock out accounts

750
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,070
but we're just going to try and get

751
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,160
after you a model so the default I

752
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,270
couldn't directory don't actually drink

753
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:16,010
up yes so yeah basically passphrases

754
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,770
better blogger is going to be better and

755
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,710
way more important than being complex

756
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,220
longer is always better in just about

757
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,150
anything monitoring tools watch your

758
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,430
logs get some like red alert stopped

759
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,760
going you need to be alerted when your

760
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,400
network is under attack that's plenty

761
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,460
simple a lot of people don't a lot

762
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,040
companies don't but if they're standing

763
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,070
up in enterprise environment they should

764
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,890
be qualified and vigilant enough to run

765
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:56,570
it or else Darryl one of them failed to

766
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,970
beta account lockout really nasty

767
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,290
account block out where you say you can

768
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,910
get your password wrong twice and then

769
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,040
you're locked out until you call IT

770
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,870
who's in India by the way they're asleep

771
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,710
now is expensive for people it may clock

772
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:14,330
out easier either by introducing just

773
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,810
delays introducing short block out here

774
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,950
is anything that will make your users

775
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,410
not hate you it'll still dis wait root

776
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,530
four stacks I think the LAN does

777
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:33,550
for you that and you could not have the

778
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:40,920
staff in government well be realistic

779
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,860
Charlotte president that's a little bit

780
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,060
the palsy I'm saying I mean if you gonna

781
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,400
really that bad there you'd be surprised

782
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,220
I'm seeing something mean I know I mean

783
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,400
I know there's I know the mechanics

784
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,000
behind that ticular thinking beyond

785
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
scope this was taken but you can't put

786
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,490
it and say so with fail2ban does I gave

787
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,760
you the ability to set delays okay is it

788
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,340
hi damn look at feel advances if

789
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:26,500
acquaint us okay okay it really won't be

790
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,320
ms distance used to have a time delay

791
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,180
that is actually so I random you get a

792
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,040
period who may wear the tree the five

793
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,830
minutes and on progressively more but

794
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,570
what was nice about that you could

795
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,720
absolutely correct password and it until

796
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,010
they ignore you you wouldn't know that

797
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,030
was correct again time period a lot of

798
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,730
web services are implementing delays

799
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,220
when you try to get an account a single

800
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,650
account tries to log in to lunch it says

801
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,420
yet you've got to wait and then if you

802
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,800
keep getting at while the timer gets

803
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,000
increasingly large especially in web

804
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,670
services you rarely see strict lockout

805
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,990
you usually say with banks health care

806
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,760
especially social networks or anything

807
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,210
that's not really important data you

808
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,500
don't see a kind of lockout you see

809
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,520
these delays but monitoring tools are

810
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,760
important see if this has more more

811
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,350
services sort of captured challenges

812
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,170
that pursue a failed login to them

813
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:39,760
like a delay it depends there's a lot of

814
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,890
great tools that solve friendly great

815
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,010
captions and any time a new capture

816
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,890
comes out or a new style you'll get

817
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,109
tools written specifically to attack

818
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,170
those now luckily the tools leak then

819
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,900
you can use them to do good things with

820
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,119
reading like translate books or read all

821
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:01,329
the dresses or whatever but it's it's

822
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,770
the same canon asking me out with

823
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,270
antivirus somebody builds a better

824
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,530
caption somebody's going to build a

825
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,780
better capture reader india everyone

826
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,040
benefits but we're still fighting the

827
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:19,630
same thing any questions back on ok the

828
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:28,000
password certainly stayed on that is it

829
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,980
difficult to get as password it all

830
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,290
depends on the environment and what

831
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,309
you're trying to attack there are some

832
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:40,930
if you're attacking a windows

833
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,900
environment I essential at your on the

834
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,480
local box you can get whatever local

835
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,880
credentials are on the box windows is

836
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,799
trivial to pull credentials from the

837
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:56,230
same with linux OS 10 if you are a

838
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,540
process on the machine you can get the

839
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,210
local credentials for that machine there

840
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,880
are ways to mitigate that but not my

841
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,349
default that was part of page talk

842
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:12,490
earlier he got walks but he didn't have

843
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:15,190
any admin credentials so yeah held in

844
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,089
society today one of the ones it was a

845
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:23,349
memory it was it as far as web services

846
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:25,150
it depends on the service house

847
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,000
implemented when it's written in early

848
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,680
PP apps if you go back I years ago 10

849
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,900
years ago early PDFs that had a mysql

850
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,460
back end it was really easy because no

851
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,710
one sanitize their inputs

852
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,140
is no one cared PHP makes are really

853
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,660
easy to develop web applications

854
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,060
fantastic downside of that is you get a

855
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,380
lot of people who shouldn't be building

856
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,910
web applications now building web

857
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,400
applications so instead of putting in a

858
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,300
user name they can now put in just a

859
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,820
piece on a database query to pull

860
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,920
database information out or had a user

861
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,980
or drop all the information what have

862
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,250
you with Bobby tables and little Bobby

863
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,119
tables I love us under one bug and back

864
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,760
to the example of having access the rods

865
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,119
on a workstation that's essentially

866
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,089
going to rid of you to transfer the user

867
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:25,140
that workstation but it's a server

868
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:31,050
obviously even if it's in using Active

869
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,589
Directory anyone who comes in through

870
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:38,000
that serve route is vulnerable to

871
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
collecting your ash more or less Darrell

872
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,849
brought me more qualified answer that

873
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,619
question that I would one from Windows

874
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,000
you don't even necessarily have to crack

875
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,400
the hatch you can pass the hash data for

876
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,160
a tease token so if domain admin

877
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,859
involved corner asians gape at my apt

878
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,640
specific employment minister hi caption

879
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,040
box so I or my server yeah you know if

880
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,140
your administrative access to machine or

881
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,240
the server there's a number of tools

882
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,359
available one you can pull the hashes

883
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,910
off the box that we settle the box you

884
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,570
pull the tokens of the delegation third

885
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,119
consecutive replay from the box of the

886
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,490
other thing she favors you see with his

887
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,560
condition as they run out of the box and

888
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,960
the waxing strip anyone is a dedicated

889
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,070
under the box password out of memory or

890
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,020
if you've exploited you can also run

891
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,080
many cats on that box which will also

892
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,530
pull those the same password on plain

893
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:47,740
tex whether Kerberos or not

894
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,240
all out of the system of claim tax that

895
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,740
all students have been privileged oh

896
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,920
right yes I was trying to to come from

897
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,160
the ground up if I had someone's hash

898
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,680
through less privileged method then

899
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,640
automatically the rainbow table gives me

900
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,790
access within a matter of minutes to

901
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,660
that password so i am kevin dillon ash

902
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,410
the indolent ash right and what is about

903
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,600
in the mother's apartment eyelash then

904
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,900
drove up for you unless you have a

905
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,640
decent record prison has a good complex

906
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,460
password you may not get the may not be

907
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,040
able t be practical and ash but you have

908
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,869
a actually really no need to crack

909
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:38,890
replay the badges so so seems to me that

910
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,600
the weakest link here is can i obtain an

911
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,930
act without an improvement 30 yes

912
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,990
there's lots of exploits that they learn

913
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,750
from being on my box alright there's

914
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,670
lots of exploits to do privilege

915
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,250
escalation where you take a standard

916
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,619
user account and you can get certain

917
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,840
additional privileges to be able to try

918
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,570
to access things you're not supposed to

919
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,470
yeah that's one of the things you would

920
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,480
go after as an attacker you have the

921
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,330
system you detach save ministry that

922
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,300
should your system on edge those you

923
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,300
compromise the promises on a machine

924
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,730
that you pull the ashes associated with

925
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,040
a machine or gain access to your crew

926
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,780
memory areas on that machine bathroom if

927
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,520
you just have a hash one of the typical

928
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,920
text so I compromised the machine on and

929
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,040
set from last week and we had a guy's

930
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,350
passions not a domain admin as she was

931
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,570
an active directory hash but we want

932
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,550
elevator right with you

933
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,920
users hash will give us access to his

934
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,010
resources own so we quickly replay that

935
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,130
ash facts against entire windows all

936
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,770
machines immersive environment made it

937
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:58,340
specifically requesting see dollars seed

938
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,430
offer and looking to try to retrieve a

939
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,740
specific Bob windows system32 cmd.exe

940
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,480
but I plan that attack specifically

941
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,970
looking for that knowing that through

942
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,120
that method we be able to identify what

943
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,530
machines that person would have

944
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,290
administrative a console and just a

945
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,690
mystery factors definitely eaters we

946
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,550
played that back to skype sure enough to

947
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:25,400
be a developer really gaining access and

948
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,680
environment at two thousand sheets it

949
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,730
really gain access 15 sheets and he had

950
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:34,760
and as a developer we get footholds each

951
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,010
one of those as administrator turn

952
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,410
around and use the tool many cats to

953
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,810
pull all the passwords out of memory on

954
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,960
all 52 machines and by doing that we

955
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,190
were able to compromise 16 and count so

956
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,650
as a matter of is it edible and spread

957
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,500
the employees escalate data straight and

958
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,720
so testing services to factor on your

959
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,370
domain servers stop that what was that

960
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,830
2-pack urban areas you factor

961
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,810
authentication on your domain servers

962
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:10,370
that pull the hash tables does that stop

963
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:14,390
what you just it will stop some stuff I

964
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:16,550
have yet to encounter anyone with two

965
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,640
factor but i have discussed that copies

966
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,710
with other people the two-factor

967
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,200
authentication will stop certain levels

968
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,690
of access typically that level of access

969
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:31,340
is being stock is going to be our TV so

970
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,050
i'm not going to be able to rdp to that

971
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,930
box but i can still make as the

972
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:39,080
requested loi de aki challenge just like

973
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,680
you make SMB request that box as an

974
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,920
admin level bypass Rd the interface I

975
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,260
can easily actually that Brock's writing

976
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,710
the boxes

977
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,660
that's that's what I understand how

978
00:50:53,660 --> 00:51:00,440
function but I and if they did I think a

979
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,850
patient this is that we're with you or
