Financial Bank in Cincinnati I also run

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,850
the Simpa security sig so I serve as the

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,920
chair there hit our booth up out in the

67
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,290
middle there is all sorts of propaganda

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,329
that you can pick up out there for all

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,310
of our Cincinnati InfoSec native groups

70
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,290
maybe not all of them but a good

71
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,540
representation of them anyway

72
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,260
and I'm also an ambassador and security

73
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,030
researcher for a bugcrowd what's really

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,560
cool about this talk is because of the

75
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,850
people there in this room I'm going to

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,900
call on some of them throughout this

77
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,700
talk which will be a little bit

78
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,670
different than any other place I might

79
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,579
give this one so really glad the crowds

80
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,958
here that is here so some objectives is

81
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,390
what I want to provide attendees with

82
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,238
ideas and options for continue to expand

83
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,399
their information security skills not

84
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,159
all these ideas are gonna appeal to

85
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,200
everyone and that's perfectly fine

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,230
my advice is pick and choose the one

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,630
specifically that means something to you

88
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,940
the ones that you think yeah this is

89
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,900
something I would like to do may be a

90
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,490
good idea for me

91
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,830
I think I can latch onto that and run

92
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,720
with it so the examples provided these

93
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,070
are not an exhaustive list there's way

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,470
more resources than I could ever

95
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,210
possibly cover but if you feel really

96
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,000
compelled that there's that one big

97
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,590
thing I'm really just missing what and I

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,979
would say let me know but really this

99
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,469
talk is for everyone as the title would

100
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,150
indicate so I'm sure with everybody in

101
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,110
the room if you think of something that

102
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:01,388
I'm just outright missing so why should

103
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,030
I do any of this stuff is the question

104
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,889
you might be asking so I'm gonna lay out

105
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,809
my case here of developing improving

106
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,780
your skills helps whether you're looking

107
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,090
for your first ever InfoSec opportunity

108
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,888
and I get asked off a lot how do I break

109
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,630
into this industry I've got a degree I

110
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:21,210
got certifications it's getting me

111
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:23,500
nowhere I can't even get interviews so

112
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,930
also if you're looking to take that next

113
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,460
career step maybe you think okay I'm in

114
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,410
a situation now where I'm ready to move

115
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,680
on regardless of what the reason might

116
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,380
be hopefully I'm giving you some ideas

117
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,660
for that if nothing else making impacts

118
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,630
now and starting now is gonna help

119
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,660
safeguard your own job security so if

120
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,340
your situation ever changes unexpectedly

121
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,139
you're ready to hit the ground running

122
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,969
on to the next thing and hopefully where

123
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,270
I get those connections and contacts

124
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,190
where you can basically impress people

125
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,130
enough where you don't have to worry

126
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,510
about these kind of things again or

127
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,729
maybe you just want to simply help

128
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,590
mentor other people which is certainly a

129
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,990
noble cause it's a large part of why I

130
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,940
do the things I do running the group's I

131
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,820
run coming to conferences like this and

132
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,620
speaking and maybe you're just looking

133
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,690
to give back to the information security

134
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,060
community or get involved a little bit

135
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,070
more and we're going to talk about this

136
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,099
but there's tons of opportunity to do so

137
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,030
within the space so some inspirations

138
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:24,039
for this talk

139
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,859
creative workarounds to learning with

140
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,380
very limited time in Xero training

141
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,539
budget so if you're Michael Brown in the

142
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,630
room you can go to your employer and say

143
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,020
hey I want to take this really expensive

144
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,690
professional training halfway

145
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,878
the country yeah sure go ahead that

146
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,430
sounds nice bring back what you'll learn

147
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,039
if you're in the boat I'm in which is

148
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,080
probably the majority of us you get told

149
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,180
yeah we're sorry we don't get a heavy

150
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,150
trading budget for that or yeah we

151
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,680
requested it and they got denied so

152
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,840
hopefully I'm giving us some ideas to

153
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,120
work around those things but free

154
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,429
educational sites other conference

155
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,639
speakers and talks articles blogs

156
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,069
podcasts and videos bugcrowd University

157
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,139
which we're gonna touch on later and

158
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,300
then personal experience I've learned an

159
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,060
awful lot I think running a local

160
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,430
information security meetup group and

161
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,470
also in my time of mentoring others I've

162
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,300
helped a lot of people get job

163
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,580
interviews in some cases that's led the

164
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,190
jobs others it didn't but at least it

165
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,289
gave them an opportunity to do so and I

166
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,719
do get asked for a lot of advice on this

167
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:32,060
so what I wanted to do is put together a

168
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:33,860
talk that covers really the basis of

169
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,020
everything I try to convey but I just

170
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:43,069
don't usually have time and that brief

171
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:44,180
one-on-one exchange with people so one

172
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:45,889
of the things I want to start with is

173
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,020
that traditional qualification of

174
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,300
triangle that most people look at in the

175
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,969
deployment situation and then this

176
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,520
triangle we have education experience

177
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:57,319
and certifications and those are sort of

178
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,370
the traditional model what people try to

179
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,430
do in my experience having experience is

180
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,900
typically the most valued by employers

181
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,610
that's the thing they appreciate the

182
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,080
most more so than the degree or the

183
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,120
certification because if you have the

184
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,740
experience you can speak to if you have

185
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,349
other people that can validate what you

186
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,490
know on a personal level it does have a

187
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:21,319
big impact and some just general notes

188
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,860
is the triangle itself it doesn't count

189
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,840
for things like luck or particularly

190
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,389
around the Dayton areas having a

191
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,250
security clearance which I don't have if

192
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,440
anybody has secrets to that let me know

193
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,390
because I don't have any short of just

194
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,510
trying to get it into a bunch of defense

195
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,100
contractors hoping one will sponsor you

196
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,450
into a position

197
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,580
but some other things I want to talk

198
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,260
about that may not make a lot of sense

199
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,170
of the information of security talk but

200
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,850
emotional intelligence quotient or he IQ

201
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,680
for short and I'm going to touch on this

202
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:56,540
as near the end of the talk good to the

203
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,939
next slide here so if a subject

204
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,069
street-cred what I found is giving that

205
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,770
first opportunity and InfoSec is really

206
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,300
hard it's just hard to get somebody to

207
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,910
give you an opportunity if you don't

208
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,650
have any experience whatsoever some

209
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,719
people will get lucky and I talked about

210
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,760
luck some people might get a good co-op

211
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,520
or an internship maybe that leads to a

212
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,860
position I've set in conferences for

213
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,569
years and a lot of speakers are saying

214
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,340
oh well you know it's just happenstance

215
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,420
that I happen to be somewhere and

216
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,190
somebody said well you're gonna be our

217
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,319
security guy because of this or we need

218
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,560
somebody to fill it so they've almost

219
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,320
gotten into it by accident and then

220
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,180
there are people like mine where it took

221
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,760
a lot of years to finally get somebody

222
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,010
give me that first opportunity I'm

223
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,420
hoping to help deliver at talks at a

224
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,270
shortcut that for a lot of people

225
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,520
looking to break in or maybe move up the

226
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,380
ladder a little bit so equipped with

227
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,730
only a degree in certifications alone

228
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,310
the world probably isn't gonna beat a

229
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,280
path to your door I hate to give that

230
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,869
bad news in spite of having you know a

231
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,850
large number of job openings that are

232
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,810
unfulfilled year over year that's a

233
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,980
growing number and big skills gaps it's

234
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,650
still hard to get somebody give you that

235
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,850
opportunity but I do have some ideas on

236
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,350
how you can stand apart from the crowd

237
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,930
and this one I'm going to talk about

238
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,130
next so there's some things you can do

239
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,939
to really help yourself

240
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:19,570
and again whether your first time sort

241
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,160
of mid-level trying to move up or you're

242
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,380
simply just wanting to raise you're

243
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,030
prone prey profile so you have better

244
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,300
opportunities later on down the road

245
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,819
even if your concerns aren't immediate

246
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,400
ones so you can do things like writing

247
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,400
recording posting new tech videos

248
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,980
volunteering doing bug bounties and

249
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:49,350
teaching others are great ways to sort

250
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,540
of stand apart from the crowd

251
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,040
usually in job interview situations I've

252
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,779
been the one being interviewed most

253
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,219
often but there have been a few times

254
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,339
where I've sat on the other side of the

255
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,600
table and I'm talking to candidates and

256
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,779
trying to understand what they actually

257
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,699
know and the biggest thing it's hard to

258
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,920
determine sometimes is who's really

259
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,719
passionate is this person just looking

260
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,969
for a nine-to-five job or they a nine to

261
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,410
fiver or they really have a passion for

262
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,230
this stuff and they're just looking for

263
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,399
somebody you much hands and these are

264
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,139
the kinds of things if I find out

265
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,540
they're doing it tells me an awful lot

266
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,019
about that person and their motivations

267
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,399
for applying for a position so some

268
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,249
writing examples you can write tech

269
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,100
articles tech blogs or white papers are

270
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:34,350
great ways to get some material even if

271
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,360
you don't have high traffic if you can

272
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,029
speak to those things it says an awful

273
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,949
lot event write-ups if you come to an

274
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,529
event like this maybe just share out

275
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:46,109
your key takeaways you got five speakers

276
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:49,230
today maybe your top take away from each

277
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,660
speaker or something you've learned be a

278
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,029
great write-up just to throw out there

279
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,069
shows you not only were you here but you

280
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,999
were also paying attention and looking

281
00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:01,709
to expand your knowledge so video of

282
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:04,439
some examples you can record and post

283
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:06,329
videos I have a question beside YouTube

284
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:08,790
channel and the reason for that is

285
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:13,040
because recently YouTube has decided

286
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:16,860
that they are going to start removing

287
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,339
content and banning content if it was

288
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,619
deemed instructional hacking videos

289
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,629
I think they've gotten a big backlash

290
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,399
and they've maybe backed off of this a

291
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:28,920
little bit what I can tell you from my

292
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,360
own personal experience is some of you

293
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,099
that were here earlier in the year you

294
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,410
saw my fishing forensics is just

295
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,379
suspicious or is it malicious talk we'll

296
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,339
see that was the ISF february meeting

297
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:40,390
give me a pass so if I don't have that

298
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,370
date right but

299
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,920
my favorite recorded version that talk

300
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,600
was a b-sides Cleveland and after this I

301
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,610
went out look because fishing was one of

302
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,800
the things that YouTube were basically

303
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,850
removing it sure enough that video was

304
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,829
gone

305
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,740
I checked just the other day they put it

306
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:59,349
back so but it's but now it's listed as

307
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,360
restricted content and it was not listed

308
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,730
as a restricted content before about

309
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,740
other talks that were but I was sort of

310
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,320
surprised that that one they put it back

311
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,420
but they put a restricted content on it

312
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,220
so some of their alternatives and

313
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,800
Adrienne actually tweeted about this the

314
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,570
other day after I had my slide so it

315
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,279
told me I was on the right path some

316
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,320
people have recommended maybe bitch

317
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,420
shoot or other YouTube alternatives I

318
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,970
think YouTube probably go to if they're

319
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,060
not maybe a little overzealous and their

320
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,769
their content removal practices but

321
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,768
maybe keep the others in the back of

322
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,540
your mind just something to think about

323
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,250
but anyway just having a channel

324
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,459
somewhere on some video service site

325
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,899
that you you record stuff and maybe not

326
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:42,729
everybody's comfortable talking and

327
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,640
recording I've seen a lot of things

328
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,899
where people use a screen reader to

329
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,610
basically speak out the content they

330
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,920
want I've even seen people just use

331
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,800
subtitles and they're not talking at all

332
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,240
but they've got an instructional video

333
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,099
so if you're not when you record your

334
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,819
own voice those are some alternatives

335
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,319
for doing stuff like that

336
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,099
volunteering examples this is a big one

337
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,990
for me

338
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,910
so volunteering at technology

339
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,740
conferences and information security

340
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:12,160
hacker conferences is a great way to

341
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,110
expand your professional network to sort

342
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,829
of and it also demonstrates your ability

343
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,959
to work as a team actually sort of get

344
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:21,579
your hands dirty with getting involved

345
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,589
in the conference and doing this sort of

346
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:24,998
things most people if they have no

347
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,819
passion for it aren't going to take

348
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:30,220
those steps so it's one of those things

349
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:32,319
absolutely tells people that you know

350
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,319
you're authentic when you're applying

351
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:38,319
for a position like that local tech and

352
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:42,339
InfoSec meetup groups so John mentioned

353
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:44,529
it OAS F I think they right now have

354
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,050
three open board positions if you're

355
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:50,050
local you can put forth a little bit of

356
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,269
time I know they're looking for help and

357
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,920
really running my own group most

358
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,199
immutable groups want help even if it's

359
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,599
not publicized so I don't really come

360
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:01,290
out and ask for help but in my dreams

361
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,360
somebody would come up to me and say man

362
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,129
he put forth a lot of time and effort in

363
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,720
this stuff looks like a lot of work but

364
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:09,670
I think I would like to help take some

365
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,319
of that burden from you can I you know I

366
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,180
would love to have somebody volunteer to

367
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:15,250
be like an understudy that I could

368
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,120
mentor and groom I'm not gonna be able

369
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,170
to run the group did I run forever at

370
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,329
some point I'm gonna have to turn over

371
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,800
the keys to somebody and it would be

372
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:27,000
really awesome if they were ready to

373
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,160
take the reins right then and there so

374
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,170
you know even if somebody's not actively

375
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,170
asking for help ask him hey could use it

376
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:38,079
you know maybe a person under you backup

377
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,939
something like that or just maybe there

378
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,429
are outright board positions open where

379
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,439
you have an immediate impact if you can

380
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:46,040
do something like that again it shows it

381
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,689
shows passion

382
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,530
and it also shows giving back to the

383
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:53,000
community is really helping out one of

384
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,160
the things I want to talk about sort of

385
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,650
teaching in general if you really want

386
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,760
to learn its subject well if you set

387
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,810
yourself up to where you have to teach

388
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,460
it to other people

389
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,689
you're really gonna put in time to learn

390
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,430
it and to make sure you know your stuff

391
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,340
so you can share that material with

392
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,920
other people it's a fantastic way to

393
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,520
sort of increase your own knowledge in a

394
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,380
subject

395
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,380
when you have to stand up from a crowd

396
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,400
and speaking to it conferences like this

397
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,620
meetup groups webinars workshops

398
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,560
brown-bag lunches school labs library

399
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:27,290
rooms always everywhere else anywhere

400
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,770
you can teach there's you know a lot of

401
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,569
need is much of a struggle as security

402
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,750
is to get right a lot of times you know

403
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,960
clearly we we need more people entering

404
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,000
into that and doing those things there's

405
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,860
some online places you can learn but not

406
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,110
only learn they also actively are

407
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,000
looking for instructors so there's

408
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,940
opportunities there at places like cyber

409
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,210
re LinkedIn learning plural site in

410
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,580
udemy so you can Google search any of

411
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,620
these and find their website also if you

412
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,210
do download the slide deck there are

413
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,000
embedded hyperlinks that will take you

414
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,980
to the sites so get the slide decks

415
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,319
later on but yeah here's more teaching

416
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,000
opportunities that are out there I've

417
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,099
seen all of these sites actively

418
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,500
recruiting for additional instructors

419
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,500
just a great way to get involved

420
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,690
so bug bounty programs this is a good

421
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,959
one you can actually get paid to hack

422
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,070
stuff legally and ethically I mean what

423
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,319
could be better right

424
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,810
and now with that but think about this

425
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,939
you're gaining the professional

426
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,820
experience when you do so now the

427
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:38,150
barrier to entry at places like bugcrowd

428
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,879
and other bug bounty hunting companies

429
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,980
is that the barrier to entry is pretty

430
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,360
low yeah there's some trust stuff you

431
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,400
have to send them you know your driver's

432
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,810
license and other personal information

433
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,060
and stuff like that because they have to

434
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,340
do a certain level of validation of who

435
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,590
you are to make sure it's good but in

436
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,300
general this is a lot easier to get your

437
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,419
foot in the door and something like this

438
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,399
is to just land the first opportunity so

439
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,780
if you're struggling to find somebody

440
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,960
give you an opportunity and InfoSec

441
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,760
consider doing bug bounty stuff it's

442
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,210
great because you can really kind of do

443
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,440
it on your own pace at your own time

444
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,140
you've got ample time to learn stuff

445
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,730
before you start going into it it's

446
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,620
really a great way to get professional

447
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,160
experience even if nobody else will give

448
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,810
you a chance and then also you can along

449
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,540
those lines consider entering a capture

450
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,270
the flag competition just add personal

451
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:33,080
skills that increase proficiency to

452
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:36,170
expand your skill sets tiny-bell

453
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,250
together and again I said before not

454
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,020
everything is going to appeal to

455
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,960
everyone pick and choose what you like

456
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,030
what you think would yeah sort of speaks

457
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,400
to you the most but publicly Journal the

458
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,620
stuff you're learning whether you're

459
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,270
taking the class participating in CTF

460
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,070
attending a workshop earning a

461
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,710
certification completing an online

462
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,560
challenge or course conducting security

463
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,960
research you know whatever have you but

464
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,260
also publish a write-up or post a video

465
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,940
recap there yet consider doing both to

466
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,070
really sort of cast a wide net

467
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,529
and again these it's all about showing

468
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,418
passion and also it sort of forces you

469
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,529
to you know when you're writing notes

470
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,240
when you're taking things down or

471
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:17,010
explaining to other people that just

472
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,159
sort of reinforces those skills within

473
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,140
you it's a really great thing and then

474
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,350
if you do this things come back to an

475
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,450
OSF come to a simple security sig or any

476
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,100
other local if a second heat up group

477
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,649
and share what you've learned because

478
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,750
people would love to just see a recap in

479
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:35,760
just sort of a replay of hey I did this

480
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,500
thing I thought was really cool here are

481
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,990
my favorite parts let me show you what I

482
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,330
learned you know those are the kind of

483
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,559
things that most meetup groups are going

484
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:49,110
begging for speakers in conferences yeah

485
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,000
that's a great way to do it and then put

486
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,158
these activities on your resume that's

487
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,470
an important part if you're applying for

488
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:59,820
a position if you don't speak to it I

489
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,529
may not know you have a YouTube channel

490
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,270
I mean I know you've written up some

491
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:05,640
cool malware analysis work that you've

492
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,860
done or whatever have you if you can

493
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,299
demonstrate that and I see like hey this

494
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,279
is a person I want to talk to you

495
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,510
because again I know they're authentic I

496
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,220
know they've got a passion for it

497
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,049
they're going above and beyond this

498
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,299
wasn't in their job they just did it on

499
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:23,879
their own time says volumes about who

500
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:26,158
you are and what your motivations are so

501
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,710
when it comes to learning there's plenty

502
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,159
of ways to learn new things and probably

503
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,039
more places now than ever before the

504
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,809
online learning has really exploded

505
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:40,169
there's so many great resources out

506
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:41,908
there and you know for me personally

507
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,220
though I still learned best through

508
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:46,020
hands-on activities and time in the seat

509
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,940
and it's just getting that personal

510
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,799
experience it's one thing if I'm reading

511
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,809
something in a book or I'm watching a

512
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:55,039
YouTube video or I come to a conference

513
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:58,260
and I see these things and it's cool it

514
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,120
sort of works a lot better for me if I

515
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,220
actually get my hands dirty and do these

516
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,049
things myself because I remember it

517
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,730
better I have that experience firsthand

518
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:08,559
as opposed to just being an observer

519
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,090
so there might be a lot of other people

520
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,450
in this room that we're invest the same

521
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:17,590
way I know that's for me personally how

522
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:19,420
I learned and then we're gonna just look

523
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,860
at some free and low-cost examples for

524
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,429
doing that because again we're not all

525
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,639
Michael Brown back there if you get

526
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:29,850
their employer to pay for this stuff

527
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,960
so once first talk about the seed labs

528
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:36,370
these are put together by Syracuse

529
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:40,480
University started by dr. Doo and so the

530
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:42,580
seed projects objective is to develop

531
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,650
hands-on laboratory exercises called

532
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,980
seed labs for computer and information

533
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,770
security education and help destructors

534
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,870
adapt these labs in their curricula at

535
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,760
present there are over 30 labs available

536
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,379
what I like about the seed labs as these

537
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,559
are very geared towards offensive

538
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,750
security learning but guess what you

539
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,730
don't have to be an instructor you can

540
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,040
be your own instructor and get these

541
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,740
labs absolutely for free and then

542
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,120
basically work through them and we're

543
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,740
gonna just go through what these labs

544
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,780
are and want hate reading slides

545
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,460
verbatim but I think there's so much

546
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:19,600
good stuff in here that you actually

547
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,010
want to highlight what they cover so for

548
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,860
software security labs they have a

549
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:26,950
buffer overflow of long lab basically a

550
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,379
Lipsy attack lab environment variable

551
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,840
and suid lab which is great for

552
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:35,260
privilege escalation particularly on

553
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,418
unix-like operating systems race

554
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,640
condition vulnerability labs how many

555
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,160
people really liked Darryl's talk for

556
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,809
you boo to root guess what when you

557
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,090
rooted that device when he got to a

558
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:48,280
shell account yeah that was a race

559
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,689
condition so this will teach you a

560
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,660
little bit more about that and getting

561
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,720
hands-on with a dirty cow the TAC lab

562
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,380
which is the copy-on-write

563
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,550
features within the Linux kernel that

564
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,180
basically becomes another privilege

565
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:06,879
escalation attack and I think also maybe

566
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,710
even some Android OS is historically

567
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,440
were proving that as well if I'm not

568
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,350
mistaken I've also seen Darrell their

569
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,720
demo for mastering vulnerabilities and

570
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,429
give really good talks on that and it's

571
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,350
stuff still relevant today it still

572
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,180
works a lot of cases even though it

573
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,129
shouldn't with secure coding practices

574
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,200
we all know that that doesn't always

575
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,860
happen right so shell-shocked

576
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,070
vulnerability lab pretty pertinent

577
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,229
newsworthy stuff from back in the day

578
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:38,280
and then so there's network security

579
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:41,910
labs and one on sniffing and spoofing

580
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:45,160
tcp/ip attacks heartbleed attack lab

581
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:48,190
local DNS attack lab remote DNS attack

582
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,430
lab firewall explorations exploration

583
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:55,390
hit firewall evasion and then some VPN

584
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:57,490
stuff and then more attack labs doing

585
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,680
some have sex stuff with web security

586
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,350
labs there's cross-site scripting

587
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:06,580
attacks cross-site request forgery

588
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,919
attacks sequel injection attack labs and

589
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,350
then system security labs such as

590
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,390
spectre and meltdown which certainly are

591
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,879
newsworthy the amazing thing about these

592
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,890
attacks are even very recently I

593
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,380
remember Microsoft has put out quite a

594
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,420
number of updates for these things I

595
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,490
think even some within the last six

596
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,860
months even though these side-channel

597
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,590
attacks are not new vulnerabilities it's

598
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:32,050
very hard to remediate them or at least

599
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,959
put those wrappers around them at the OS

600
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,250
level so you know you might think well

601
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,440
that's old news it's yesterday's news

602
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,940
there may still be some problems where

603
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,950
people can still exploit these things

604
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,170
and future patches to be released you

605
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,420
know who knows when but at least you get

606
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:49,540
a good basis for that by doing these

607
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,820
labs and then still some more so there's

608
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,649
some cryptography stuff such as md5

609
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,240
collisions where you take two different

610
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,029
files and make

611
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,070
have the same md5 checksum so they look

612
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:02,169
the same so for things that are doing

613
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:05,379
integrity checking based on the md5 hash

614
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:07,120
value there's ways to defeat that and

615
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,399
this walks you through it

616
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,459
RSA encryption the signature stuff

617
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:16,418
secret key encryption lab pseudo random

618
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,520
number generation PKI and then some

619
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:20,440
mobile security lab stuff such as the

620
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,379
android repackaging attack lab where you

621
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,510
take applications for the Android OS you

622
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,240
modify them in malicious fashions and

623
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,640
then you repackage them back up and make

624
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,500
them look like the original and then the

625
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,200
Android device routing labs so there's

626
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,370
some really great stuff for some free

627
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,480
labs it's really cool in my opinion so I

628
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:44,379
do want to talk about some caveats

629
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,059
though so there's a book because the

630
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,549
online documentation for these labs is

631
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:50,470
pretty sparse and they don't really

632
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:53,679
cover a whole lot so you'll want to

633
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:55,649
order doctor dues accompanying computer

634
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,029
internet security a hands-on approach

635
00:25:55,649 --> 00:26:00,129
2nd edition I don't have the second

636
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:02,200
edition book yet and the first edition

637
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,149
book here with me if somebody would like

638
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,940
to just flip through it I do want this

639
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:08,320
book back when I leave today but you're

640
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,909
more than welcome to peruse it take a

641
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,830
look at it and see what's in here and

642
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:13,919
determine if this is something that you

643
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,629
think would be valuable to your time

644
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,610
it's about seventy dollars on the Amazon

645
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,890
just a little bit under 70 bucks

646
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,070
actually and if you're ordering there be

647
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,539
sure to go to smile Amazon and choose

648
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,129
the Ohio recreation and security forum

649
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:28,270
so the group gets a little kickback for

650
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,840
that right

651
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,799
getting some applause for that excellent

652
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,418
but yeah if you wanna get the most of

653
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,340
these labs highly highly highly

654
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:39,520
recommend the book otherwise it'll be

655
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:42,220
hard to sort of work through some of

656
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,080
these things on your own and $70 that

657
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,419
may not be not anything to sneeze at but

658
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,340
it's a whole lot cheaper than a lot of a

659
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:51,309
lot of training courses I've seen

660
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,689
personally yeah college classes

661
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,220
absolutely I look at some of these

662
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,250
classes and I think yeah that's really

663
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,390
cool work will pay for it and honestly

664
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,860
if I had that kind of money to throw

665
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:04,830
around I just go get a nicer car

666
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,449
so yeah pretty expensive when you

667
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,250
consider the awesome of the alternatives

668
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,260
out there so I'm also going to talk

669
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,720
about the anisa trading labs and anybody

670
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,340
was here for OSF their last monthly

671
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,309
meeting will be kind of in there with

672
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,139
this a little bit so these were created

673
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:21,990
by the European Union Agency for

674
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,549
cybersecurity and ISA they Anisa see

675
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,250
certain trading material containing

676
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:29,280
handbooks for teachers tool sets for

677
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,260
students and virtual images virtual

678
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,928
images to support hands-on training

679
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,000
sessions that's a great thing about this

680
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:37,559
what I like about them is they give you

681
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,049
absolutely everything you need for

682
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:43,320
absolutely free these are lube unto

683
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:45,629
based virtual machine images unlike the

684
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,530
seed labs these are more around incident

685
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:51,659
response and for red digital forensics

686
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:54,299
focused but I really love the way these

687
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,380
are put together I've done a bit Lee

688
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,090
version of the website

689
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,610
so again if you get the slide deck you

690
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,928
get out there easily enough we're going

691
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,908
to talk about these because again it's

692
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:06,720
just so much great stuff that they put

693
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:09,990
in here so building artifact handling

694
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,390
and analysis environment process and

695
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,080
storing artifacts artifact analysis

696
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,039
fundamentals advanced artifact handling

697
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,789
introduction to advanced artifact

698
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,890
analysis dynamic analysis of artifacts

699
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:25,100
static analysis of artifacts forensic

700
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,600
analysis local incident response

701
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,480
forensic analysis Network incident

702
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,240

703
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,940
analysis developing countermeasures and

704
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,710
common framework for artifact analysis

705
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,500
activities

706
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:43,370
and then also using indicators to

707
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,260
enhance defense capabilities

708
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:48,810
identification in handling of electronic

709
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,060
evidence digital forensics which again

710
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,590
if you were here for OSF last month

711
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,260
you've already done two-thirds of that

712
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,270
lab I highly encourage you to get the VM

713
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,800
image in the manual and go through the

714
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:03,840
last piece where you basically use the

715
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:08,250
material that you have and sort of show

716
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,230
that this is a zeus variant we didn't

717
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,470
get it have time and really the

718
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,300
resources to do that last part in the

719
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,190
OSF so on your own

720
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,770
why not complete that training is some

721
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,110
really cool stuff is some good exercises

722
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,850
and these are based on Lou bunt too so

723
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,350
they're very lightweight VMs you don't

724
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,709
need much of a system at all to run

725
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:32,189
these things I really like the way they

726
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:34,050
put these together so after that we've

727
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,240
got mobile threat um

728
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:39,690
incident handling mobile threats

729
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,540
incident handling part to proactive

730
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,670
incident detection automation incident

731
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,370
handling introduction in network

732
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,260
forensics honey pots vulnerability

733
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,590
handling and finally presenting

734
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,050
correlating and filtering various feeds

735
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:56,790
so that's a lot of great stuff for

736
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,050
absolutely free all you gonna do is go

737
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,550
out there and download it put it a

738
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,470
little bit of time they give you the

739
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,110
manuals everything you need I really

740
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,730
like these labs a lot so I can't say

741
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,500
enough about the C labs and the anisa

742
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:12,150
labs so some caveats here these labs are

743
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,490
built with a noticeable international

744
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,980
focus that's created by the EU so the

745
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,660
European Union makes these things so

746
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,670
what you'll find is the GMT times the

747
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,430
labs are very different from USA time

748
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,440
zones the documentation is written in

749
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,660
international English rather than US

750
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,100
English so when you're looking at these

751
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,320
things some of the spellings are real

752
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,990
funny and things like that

753
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,610
and even when you read the c-cert that's

754
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:40,140
something you'll see a lot in the United

755
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:42,479
States that is the computer who Sears

756
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,940
computer security incident response team

757
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,470
we tend to call them Sox here security

758
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,200
operation centers and we talked about

759
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,330
sock teams and sake analysts so that's

760
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,450
one of those international nomenclature

761
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,290
things that's a little bit different

762
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,480
takes a little bit of getting used to

763
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:59,309
but something you can't work through and

764
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,320
then they do a lot of legal references

765
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,610
but again that's based on European law

766
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,370
now if you work for an international

767
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:07,049
company those might be very relevant to

768
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:10,020
what you need to know if you're

769
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:11,160
primarily us-based you know you have to

770
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,440
take those things with a grain of salt

771
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,650
there might be overlap between European

772
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,360
law and the law in the United States but

773
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:20,160
they could also be very different just

774
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,469
something to bear in mind we're really

775
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,130
reading their documentation that it may

776
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,240
not be fully applicable here I want to

777
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,520
talk a little bit just a little bit

778
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,410
about bugcrowd University so if you're

779
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,760
thinking hey that bug bounty hunting

780
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,590
stuff I really hadn't considered it

781
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,540
before but maybe that is my roadie and

782
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,000
maybe that's something I can personally

783
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,460
do to get that opportunity to get some

784
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,169
professional experience so bug tratan

785
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,330
university is a free and open-source

786
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,100
project for security education and

787
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,530
trading for the white hat hacker

788
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:53,309
community learn the basics of hacking

789
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:56,460
and bug bounty hunting they have videos

790
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:58,799
tutorials labs best practices and more

791
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,570
you get to their website which takes you

792
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,210
to their git repository where they have

793
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,520
a whole lot of resources it's continuing

794
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,320
to grow so even if you're not sure where

795
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,270
to start today here's your starting

796
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,240
point you can start here and then start

797
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,830
building up those skills and to where

798
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,720
you think you're ready to tackle your

799
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,030
first bug bound the assignment and

800
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,030
volunteer for it

801
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,030
oops

802
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:28,070
so some more free hands-on learning the

803
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:31,309
box is a relatively newer site that I'm

804
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:33,559
aware of at least and they've got some

805
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:38,059
really cool challenges out there highly

806
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:40,158
recommend you check into it yeah you do

807
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:41,629
have to hack it to get in but you know

808
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,429
if you're crafty with your internet

809
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,990
searching you get some really good tips

810
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:50,389
and hack yourself first two are how they

811
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,759
go on the cyber offense so most people

812
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:56,178
know Troy hunt for have I been poned

813
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:58,220
comm which is a fantastic site but what

814
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:00,409
doesn't get maybe as much publicity is

815
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,139
that maybe deserves is his act yourself

816
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:05,179
first Pluralsight course it's a great

817
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:08,059
place to warn web application of

818
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:10,370
security he's got a sample site already

819
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,750
out there online you can just pick up

820
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,090
from anywhere with an internet

821
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:17,139
connection and start doing that course a

822
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:19,789
really good one highly recommend it

823
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:22,610
offensive security has mostly unleashed

824
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:24,408
is a free course again it's a great

825
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,899
course I've gone through it it's been a

826
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:29,659
while but you know it's really good

827
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:31,908
stuff and so some people you know I

828
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:33,710
mentioned captured the flags and CTS and

829
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,570
some people might be a little averse to

830
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,340
you know like I'm not sure I want to

831
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,490
compete head-to-head with other people

832
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,168
live and I don't want to you know show

833
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,049
at the bottom of the scoreboard and look

834
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:47,090
like an idiot and you know in front of a

835
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:48,889
lot of other people the cool thing was

836
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,629
with a lot of capture the flag events

837
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:52,939
will upload their VM after the

838
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:55,299
conference to a site like Mullen hub

839
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,409
where you can basically download that

840
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,940
intentionally vulnerable virtual machine

841
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:00,919
image and they got all other stuff out

842
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,379
there too and you can do it on

843
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,779
self-paced Noailles over your shoulders

844
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:08,779
no no pressure you just kind of do it on

845
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:09,949
your own pace and you know really it's

846
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,679
just to enhance your own learning

847
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:14,388
process and get better at it and when

848
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,679
you get stumped you can search online to

849
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,629
find if other people have done

850
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,889
walkthrough write-ups things like that

851
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:21,290
to kind of help you through when you get

852
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:22,879
stuck it's just a great resource where

853
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,980
there's a lot of virtual machine images

854
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:31,848
you can spin up in your own home lab

855
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:34,010
and practice and get better there's also

856
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,690
some app set hands-on learning yeah I

857
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,849
must start with webgoat which is kind of

858
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,740
the granddaddy of them all it's been

859
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:43,280
around forever just to sort of give you

860
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:45,828
exercises for learning how to compromise

861
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,260
vulnerable websites web applications

862
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:51,950
that sort of thing the new hotness from

863
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,389
wasp is juice shop which is the sort of

864
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:55,629
latest and greatest thing they put out

865
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:58,160
what's really neat about this is they

866
00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:00,259
have it set up where there's a capture

867
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,700
of the flag mode I tried to look you

868
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,339
through the instructions that looked a

869
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,899
little more involved than I had time to

870
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:07,880
put into it but if anybody's ever

871
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,710
considering hosting a caption of the

872
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,020
flag or has some spare time to look in

873
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:14,680
the doing in in basically writing out

874
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,530
how you do it from scratch to completion

875
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,790
that would be a worthy project for sure

876
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,940
and then I want to talk about Mottola

877
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:25,250
day so the cool thing about today is

878
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,690
that we actually have the father of

879
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,050
Mattila day in the room anybody would

880
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:33,440
take a guess who that is it's not Daryl

881
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:35,750
huh but you're close daydream Crenshaw

882
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,310
right over there in fact I remember

883
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,890
sitting in the car

884
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:42,770
with Adrian this was him mentioned

885
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,150
weekend years and years ago and I

886
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,009
remember he was sitting in the seat

887
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,660
behind me saying guys I've been thinking

888
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,000
about doing this thing or teach people

889
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,770
about the OWASP top 10 and how these

890
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,380
vulnerabilities are exploited and so

891
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,759
forth and you know I mentioned like have

892
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,619
you looked at web go oh yeah I've looked

893
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,589
at it by Cayenne some of the something

894
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:02,119
else'll in mind and I don't remember it

895
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:03,440
was months later the one this conference

896
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,579
rolled around or maybe the following

897
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,930
year but next thing I know he's

898
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,250
presenting it and I'm like oh wow I

899
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,970
remember when he was talking about this

900
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,069
stuff in the car

901
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,828
he started it he completed it he

902
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:15,220
finished it did a great job since then

903
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:17,589
Adrian's turned it over

904
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:21,240
and it has sort of been adopted by OWASP

905
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:34,000
so it's a great great training tool

906
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:36,129
highly recommended and all right very

907
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,250
good and but yeah if it weren't for

908
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,130
Adrienne it may not be exist so very

909
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:46,050
appreciative of him as Craig is here to

910
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,050
give some credit on that for starting it

911
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,849
so here we're take a little bit

912
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,109
different approach than the rest of the

913
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,210
talk so I want to talk a little bit

914
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:56,710
about goal-setting here's just simply a

915
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,450
question if you do anything you would

916
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,910
like in the next five years what would

917
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,379
it be and no this is not the same crap

918
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,328
the interview question that people ask

919
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,430
well where do you see yourself in five

920
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:07,720
years like well I don't know I don't

921
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,339
know what opportunities are here I don't

922
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,500
know what opportunities for advancement

923
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:13,299
there are I don't know the culture I

924
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,490
don't I don't even know what I'm gonna

925
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,810
have for lunch Monday afternoon how

926
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,459
would I know where I'm gonna be five

927
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:21,279
years from now know what this question

928
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,319
is is if I could wave a magic wand and

929
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,650
do whatever I wanted to do what would

930
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:29,170
that be and really once you figure that

931
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,750
out take yourself out of the picture

932
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,670
because then you tend to give yourself

933
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,410
less excuses if you're thinking about it

934
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,869
from your own perspective imagine

935
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,609
somebody else who would acquire that

936
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,260
position what would be the steps that

937
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:43,150
they would take to get to where they are

938
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,160
you know and where you'd like to be

939
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:49,480
dream wise future five yourself right

940
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,560
shot these things down that becomes your

941
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:56,260
action plan do those steps and if you

942
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,450
take that approach I think you might

943
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,400
find that it's more beneficial than if

944
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,348
you you sort of give yourself permission

945
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,940
to make excuses for why you can't

946
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,940
achieve something five years from now

947
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,730
and just to sort of reinforce this stuff

948
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,070
a little bit

949
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,980
Jim Cathcart quotes think like the

950
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:17,080
person you intend to become that's very

951
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,570
important it's a very interesting change

952
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,180
in mindset to really sort of drive where

953
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,470
you might want to be and this is my one

954
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,500
of my personal favorites if you will

955
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:28,629
spend one extra hour each day studying

956
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,780
your chosen field you'll be a national

957
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,300
expert in that field in five years or

958
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:37,180
less so I think most of us can agree

959
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,370
that Darrell Highland is an expert in

960
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,839
hardware hacking certainly he's

961
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,920
demonstrated that in his first talk

962
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,200
today

963
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,910
Darrell quick question for you how many

964
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:51,040
years have you been doing hardware

965
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:54,029
hacking about three years you put a ton

966
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,029
hours into it right

967
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,530
the actual hardware acne taking the

968
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:17,009
noise the part it wasn't necessarily

969
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:22,740
this is what your job is the book was is

970
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:28,260
I want to learn this so you know when I

971
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:30,299
have actually 30 week I'm trying to do

972
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,580
my job I made all this stuff but what I

973
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:37,320
do is every Friday night and Saturday

974
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:40,529
night because I've been doing this for

975
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,620
three years now and I stay up too late

976
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:46,710
to so the clock 2:00 in the morning I

977
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,520
focus on thinking about things that I

978
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,970
don't know

979
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,950
and how can I go up figure them out in

980
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,959
reference to this and other things too

981
00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:00,029
and buy a frozen an extra time like that

982
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,250
it leads to this that leads to that

983
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,440
level of knowledge yeah and so let me

984
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,540
ask you fall question how much further

985
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,100
along are you now three years later than

986
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:13,320
when you started by your own estimation

987
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,810
it's kind of crazy three years ago when

988
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:19,170
I was offered the position as the

989
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:21,810
research lead for IOT technology I

990
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:26,040
didn't even know what frickin IOT stood

991
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:28,080
for what how to give me Brianna but

992
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:31,020
how you aren't was or any of this stuff

993
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,680
or anything get in touch with micronics

994
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,900
in any form or fashion in over 25 30

995
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,859
years it's up to clear back baby and

996
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,560
Technology change so yeah it's three

997
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,150
years of you know probably applying a

998
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:52,140
little more than an extra hour and it

999
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:52,860
put you learn quick absolutely and so

1000
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,450
there you have it

1001
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,150
Darrell didn't just intrinsically know

1002
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:59,970
this stuff and started day one going hey

1003
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,100
look I can you boot to root and that's

1004
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,930
no problem you know it was a process

1005
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,480
right and he put in the time the energy

1006
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,759
the effort and so that's sort of what it

1007
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,650
takes is it

1008
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,109
and then whatever schedule you work out

1009
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,300
for yourself to do that putting in the

1010
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:17,660
time that's how you grow and learn and

1011
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,250
get better and again I think nobody

1012
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,500
would argue Darrell's a national expert

1013
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:26,740
and hardware hacking just by virtue of

1014
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,740
learning that for other purposes yes

1015
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:47,000
that I see by doing this is meant to be

1016
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:49,330
given to somebody else so I put this

1017
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,500
stuff together purely for educational

1018
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:54,200
training type thing either for

1019
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,600
co-workers friends conferences and stuff

1020
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,879
like that so it's the knowledge is

1021
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,859
actually growing through a desire to

1022
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,270
share the knowledge yep

1023
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:03,619
and that really feeds back into this

1024
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,720
whole talk and I've been talking about

1025
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:07,970
this whole time and there's a perfect

1026
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,470
example real-life example everybody

1027
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,118
should be able to relate to because we

1028
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:15,950
saw it play out first hand then the

1029
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,750
first talk this morning so good stuff

1030
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,759
thank you Darrell I do want to talk

1031
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,290
about emotional intelligence I'm gonna

1032
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,790
kind of breeze through this a little bit

1033
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:26,000
because I'm starting to run on time a

1034
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:28,850
little bit but emotional intelligence BI

1035
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,220
emotional leadership PL emotional

1036
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:33,950
quotient EQ emotional intelligence

1037
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,689
quotient II IQ and there might be minor

1038
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,730
differences between these things but

1039
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,440
generally speaking most people kind of

1040
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:41,630
lump these all together and use them

1041
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,369
interchangeably but it's basically the

1042
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:46,580
capacity of individuals recognize their

1043
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:48,170
own emotions those of others discern

1044
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,600
between different feelings to label them

1045
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:54,020
appropriately use emotional information

1046
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,319
to guide thinking in behavior and manage

1047
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,900
in or adjust emotions to adapt to

1048
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,369
environments or achieve ones goals

1049
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,650
there's a Wikipedia article if you want

1050
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:06,200
to read through that later

1051
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:08,480
but building up soft skills this is the

1052
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,000
thing that we often overlook in this

1053
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,190
industry in a lot of conferences so it

1054
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,740
may sound touchy-feely for some at first

1055
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,740
but honestly I attribute a eiq for

1056
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:20,660
reaching my professional goals many

1057
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,910
studies have been done concluded in

1058
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,950
people at the highest e IQ typically

1059
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,140
achieve more success in earn higher

1060
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:30,379
compensation than even the smartest

1061
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,210
people and there are a lot of great

1062
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,130
articles through the following Google

1063
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:36,110
search of improving emotional

1064
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,430
intelligence what I recommend just find

1065
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,650
the one that speaks to you the one

1066
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,359
that's most beneficial bookmark some of

1067
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,430
those go back and revisit them

1068
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,530
periodically just to keep that stuff

1069
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,270
fresh in your mind because for a lot of

1070
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,850
people I know for myself it doesn't come

1071
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:52,250
naturally so it's something I work on

1072
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,170
personally and it's really paid a lot of

1073
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,540
dividends because before I started doing

1074
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,660
this I honestly I was kind of stuck in

1075
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,670
almost a dead-end kind of career path

1076
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:04,129
and that really changed my life and I'll

1077
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,870
be honest when I went into it when I saw

1078
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,880
like oh I got signed up for this this

1079
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,470
looks really lame I didn't have a good

1080
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,930
attitude when I headed into it

1081
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:13,879
thankfully I have to at least have

1082
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,069
enough of an open mind and be willing to

1083
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,930
listen they got far more out of it than

1084
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,510
I ever thought I would and thank

1085
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,910
goodness for that

1086
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:25,250
so some mom quotes before a IQ was a

1087
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,870
thing so mom would tell me growing up

1088
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,390
it's not always what you know but

1089
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:31,460
sometimes who you know and that's a very

1090
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,230
true statement if you have good

1091
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,640
connections and contacts that can help

1092
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,260
you out there's nothing wrong with

1093
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,480
writing somebody's coattails if you're

1094
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,910
the real deal but somebody can vouch for

1095
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,650
you and say yeah I know this person they

1096
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,500
are who they say they are I recommend

1097
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:48,320
them always treat others as you would

1098
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,940
like to be treated if you don't have

1099
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,100
anything nice to say then you shouldn't

1100
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,510
say anything at all and nobody cares how

1101
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,970
much you know until they know how much

1102
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,710
you care that last one this is true and

1103
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:59,660
boy a lot of people miss that I read

1104
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:01,130
stuff on Twitter it's absolutely

1105
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,290
ridiculous I was recently reading

1106
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,970
somebody that gives talks and they get

1107
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,860
so much criticism over stuff and

1108
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,839
nitpicking from people that probably

1109
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,880
never give talks about it themselves or

1110
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,060
really contribute much

1111
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,440
and they were getting discouraged by it

1112
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,359
and that's a shame because everybody

1113
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,160
loses wouldn't somebody decides it you

1114
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,529
know I've had enough I'm gonna drop out

1115
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,089
and just not do this stuff anymore I'm

1116
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,920
not perfect I'm not infallible

1117
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,869
look I fall short a lot of times

1118
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,880
particularly these last three bullet

1119
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,770
points but I tell you what if we all

1120
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,260
made a concerted effort to do these a

1121
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,060
little bit more this community would be

1122
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:38,030
a lot better off for it we could all be

1123
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:40,910
a lot more civil to one another and it's

1124
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,980
making accusations and assertions take

1125
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,810
time ask the questions what did you

1126
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,150
really mean by that or could you clarify

1127
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:49,759
this for me before just going on the

1128
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,630
attack and then it just goes back and

1129
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,980
forth and so my own personal

1130
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:57,800
recommendation is leave the trolli

1131
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,530
inflamed worse to all of her are I'm

1132
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,940
sorry bill and for those of you who've

1133
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:04,430
been to the troll pub Dayton will

1134
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:08,119
readily recognize the statue you also

1135
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:10,069
recognize this guy right here and oh

1136
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,410
yeah by the way this guy and this guy as

1137
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,780
well I didn't tell them I was putting

1138
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:17,868
this picture in the slide deck this was

1139
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:20,510
taken after the OSC conference in the

1140
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:22,910
Sinclair Community College learning

1141
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:26,150
spawn its Learning Center a few months

1142
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,460
ago so if I end up knifed in the parking

1143
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,780
lot laying dead in a pool of blood

1144
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,240
please tell the police that here's your

1145
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:35,690
prime suspects for that really

1146
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,459
appreciate it but very cool because a

1147
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:39,859
number of people from this picture are

1148
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,560
here not just thus but also yawns here I

1149
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:44,450
saw that which is great I think all but

1150
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,320
two of us in this photo gave talks at no

1151
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:50,890
is C here you have three fifths of your

1152
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:53,210
OSF speakers today so how cool is that

1153
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:55,490
but these guys are good friends of mine

1154
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:57,350
I really like them and I'm great too

1155
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:58,830
grateful to do this conference with them

1156
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,930
as well

1157
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,330
so just some quick conclusions and I'll

1158
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,580
wrap it up so experiment find what works

1159
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:08,069
best for you

1160
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:10,230
market yourself well you're in charge of

1161
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,250
your own personal brand nobody's going

1162
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,110
to do it for you

1163
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,790
usually so you're probably not to do it

1164
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,530
for yourself

1165
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,259
work hard and share these lessons with

1166
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:21,450
others I'm doing it all the speakers

1167
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,370
today are doing it Darrell's done it for

1168
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:26,339
a long time Adrian's done it for a long

1169
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:28,259
time yeah there's not too many people

1170
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,220
doing this believe me there's room for

1171
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,410
more

1172
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,569
so we're card share these lessons with

1173
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,549
others never stop learning you're

1174
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,300
challenging yourself that's the

1175
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,670
important thing

1176
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,770
don't be that nine to fiver those sort

1177
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:43,710
of pooh-poohing earlier you know

1178
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:45,630
actually step up and figure out what

1179
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,640
more you can contribute even if it's

1180
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,910
just a little bit it's you know it's

1181
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,440
very welcome and then also please please

1182
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,170
please don't forget those soft skills

1183
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,850
like emotional intelligence quotient and

1184
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,160
actually work on those things they will

1185
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:03,200
really help your career regardless of

1186
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:05,520
where you are at with that my content

1187
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,020
got maybe just a minute for questions

1188
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:12,020
anybody have any real quick questions

1189
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,020
yes

1190
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,119
[Music]

1191
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:42,310
but there are some other places you can

1192
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:45,940
go we're not just like recording

1193
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:49,509
lectures but also hands-on labs very

1194
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,980
good and yeah certainly groups like OSF

1195
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,560
uh security sig and a lot of other

1196
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,790
groups and since I had II wanted to help

1197
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,920
fill in that as well

1198
00:48:54,790 --> 00:49:00,040
appreciate that I think that he wants to

1199
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,180
works in government ask the gentleman

1200
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:18,940
the scene sure I'm sure you can point

1201
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:26,440
you to some great resources with

1202
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:28,570
customers consultants mostly and a lot

1203
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,270
of times when you're working we're

1204
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:33,580
delivering to your customer the biggest

1205
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:37,480
problem we have is in communication so

1206
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:38,680
it's the breakdown of oh wait I saw a

1207
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,800
problem but I didn't want to say

1208
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:43,750
anything I felt uncomfortable or this

1209
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,070
person slighted me at one point at work

1210
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:48,250
so I'm going to just kind of let this

1211
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,740
thing blow up and I think it's it's

1212
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,810
interesting to hear someone else say

1213
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,520
that you're actively trying to change

1214
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,520
the emotional intelligence because it's

1215
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,170
almost like until you're responsible for

1216
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,520
something bigger than yourself that you

1217
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,230
don't engage stuff because a lot of

1218
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,670
people I just don't walk around where

1219
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:05,290
I'm like why are you complaining it's

1220
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:08,120
really not that bad you can just talk

1221
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:11,630
about it and resolve it so what was like

1222
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,580
you're like I'm gonna have to engage try

1223
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,680
to fix this what's kind of funny you

1224
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,810
asked so just to set the table as

1225
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,750
quickly as I can be thorough enough

1226
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:23,000
about it I was like I said kind of found

1227
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,550
myself at a dead-end position I really

1228
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,320
was kind of yeah I had a certain level

1229
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:31,550
of discontentment with where I was at I

1230
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:33,400
wasn't really happy there and it sort of

1231
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,680
snowballed into a point where I became

1232
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,960
kind of really unhappy at the end almost

1233
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,480
bitterly so it's funny because I just

1234
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,030
got signed up for this stuff and but I

1235
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,160
remember a time before right took an IQ

1236
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,690
test and it was matched up against with

1237
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,399
other people who thought they were smart

1238
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:51,080
now I was in the top two or three

1239
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,980
percent or anything like that but I was

1240
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:56,810
like 7% top 7% and I'm looking at where

1241
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,480
I'm at and I'm thinking well how come

1242
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,279
I'm not in the top 70% of success I'm

1243
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,560
nowhere near I'm so far removed from

1244
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,780
that and for years I tried to be the

1245
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:08,180
smartest person in the room and then you

1246
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:10,400
run into people like Darrell and Dave

1247
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,169
Kennedy and HD more and you just think

1248
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,180
oh this is hopeless I mean they're just

1249
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:17,000
some really wicked smart people out

1250
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:18,589
there and what I realized though even as

1251
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,090
smart as I was it wasn't getting me

1252
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,340
anywhere it doesn't make a whole lot of

1253
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,990
sense I thought well maybe it's the lack

1254
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,580
of a degree and maybe I need better

1255
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,399
certifications and that's how I need to

1256
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,700
get there I don't have that much more

1257
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,860
now than I did then but I'm making more

1258
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,799
well over twice what I did back then in

1259
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:38,990
terms of income and I wasn't doing

1260
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,310
anywhere near what I wanted to do it was

1261
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:42,680
really when I took those lessons to

1262
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:44,509
heart and I started realizing I was such

1263
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,480
a privacy zealot that I didn't put

1264
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:48,770
myself out there at all and I just

1265
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,720
really went keep them up to myself

1266
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,730
because anonymous as possible as

1267
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,439
off-the-grid as possible when I realized

1268
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,640
that when to leave I didn't have any

1269
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,310
ways out because I had no anybody

1270
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:01,069
outside of there so I was able to get

1271
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:03,890
out on my own merits and blaze my own

1272
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:05,690
Trail but man it was rough country to do

1273
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,720
so it would have been so much easier if

1274
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,340
I taking the paved path and as I've

1275
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,350
started to do these things that's gotten

1276
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,200
a whole lot easier so for me that was my

1277
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,700
own personal journey

1278
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,799
I'm gonna conclude but family has

1279
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,259
questions I'm gonna be here all day also

1280
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,120
anybody wants to go to the troll pub a

1281
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,670
number of us speakers are gonna go there

1282
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,279

1283
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:30,030
