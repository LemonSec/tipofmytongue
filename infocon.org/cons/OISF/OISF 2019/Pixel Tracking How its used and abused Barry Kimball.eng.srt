1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:07,439
all right so we're going to finish up

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,550
here with our last presentation for the

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,889
day

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,070
Barry Kimball is going to talk about

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:17,580
pixel tracking and how it's used and

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,170
abused so it should be a pretty

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,419
interesting talk

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,609
Barry's worked with computers the

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,039
majority of his life as probably most of

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:32,579
us maybe he maybe he started a lot

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,960
earlier anyways anyways I studied

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,020
materials and engineering Computer

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,390
Engineering worked through how to work

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,940
through how and what makes a chip work

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,190
all the way to programming so you know

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,440
hardware and software huh that's pretty

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,599
ugly sadly not yeah so he's worked in

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,599
several fields of IT and wider range of

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,570
industries he's running the Cincinnati s

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,629
MBA and member of several local security

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,660
groups in the Cincinnati area so again

22
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:08,548
we have another Cincinnati rep here to

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:12,990
help us out for conferences this year

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:15,090
but again pixel tracking and how it's

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,310
used and abused in sonority you know

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,610
when I'm Cincinnati when I can't anymore

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,610
toto

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:37,470
marry me all right all righty

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,090
well thanks for coming out guys and you

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,850
know for those that are still conscious

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,980
and throughout so far we'll give this a

32
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,309
little run and see what you guys think

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,620
feel free to chime in this has been a

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,440
talk that's been kind of evolving over a

35
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,170
few years so feel free to inject and

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,170
might get out it may be spoken again

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,500
sometime

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:05,520
so pixel tracking what we're going to

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,470
cover and can't see anything so step

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,359
back a little bit more I guess so we're

41
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,190
going to cover what a pixel is and how

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,990
how they've been used and whether you

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,670
know how they've been abused and seeing

44
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,620
attacks and some of the things you can

45
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,679
do to help mitigate some of the

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,400
information that you give to the world

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,459
caused by them

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,230
of course I'm Barry Kimball I've

49
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,450
searched from a lot of letters that

50
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,679
people probably wow there's a few people

51
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,230
in the room that probably remember some

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,800
of the things but I'm the original MCSE

53
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,429
or you know something called son you

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:43,680
know I did my first stuff was Novell

55
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:47,340
anybody remembers that world oh yes my

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,130
favorite protocol huh but go ahead and

57
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,920
head on so what a picture stands for

58
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,600
basically it's the element for what

59
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,119
makes up the picture on the screen right

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,700
so it's usually the little square the

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,230
screens a whole bunch of little dots

62
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,690
little dots can be used for a wide range

63
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,609
of different things over the years but

64
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:11,250
it came in the use of 1965 was his first

65
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,180
existence in print as a bunch of people

66
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,500
working on the moon project said it was

67
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,350
in use for a couple years they're in

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,660
discussions for a shorthand for pictures

69
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,030
and the quality of pixelation and stuff

70
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,890
for how while the cameras could take

71
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,400
images of the moon for the moon landing

72
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:33,269
project just for an interesting history

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,780
and fun facts properties of the pixel of

74
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:40,350
cliffs included for RGB which is the

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:45,510
red/green/blue numbers and then there's

76
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:47,040
the you know ygb or the cy or CMYK wacky

77
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,040
stuff and I never seen anybody actually

78
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:56,220
utilize it but was on some of the TVs

79
00:03:50,040 --> 00:04:01,079
there for several years so some of the

80
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:03,630
mostly pixels are use them in the world

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,970
of HTML of course is the biggest effect

82
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,760
that the world sees and these are some

83
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,720
of the how to make a pixel call that's

84
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,690
an HTML and I you can see that the these

85
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,470
are different ways and the code which

86
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,519
they hide the pixel for the purposes of

87
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,280
embedding their website with tracking

88
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,430
technology and ability so that when you

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,969
visit the website this will reach out to

90
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,410
the world and try to request a

91
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,530
non-existent image in order to purposes

92
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:38,310
of logging that you visited the website

93
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,469
right and also they can return the

94
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,010
queries to your browser whatever it

95
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,300
wants to do because the browser doesn't

96
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,870
really care whether it sends back a

97
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,130
picture or not so it can request from

98
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,040
your computer a lot more information

99
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,719
than just what the picture it was

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,540
originally requesting but it by default

101
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,080
automatically gives that target location

102
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,080
your IP address

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,599
so are the first uses originally were

104
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,400
anybody it was in the world of HTML 1

105
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,319
you know it was a great way to count how

106
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,599
many times somebody visited your page or

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,460
be able to restrict you know just so you

108
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:20,389
can do an accurate page counter so

109
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,370
people were interested in that kind of

110
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,139
information the back in the ancient days

111
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,729
is like can you get you know 10 people

112
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,590
to visit your website randomly from

113
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,270
wherever in the world I used to run a

114
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,489
little script to keep track of all the

115
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,490
different countries fun stuff

116
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:40,490
the some of the uses today it's expanded

117
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,190
substantially of course the web pages

118
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,310
it's expanded in the email advertising

119
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,849
that allows companies to target and

120
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,620
better make money and some people in the

121
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:55,099
recent years have even figured out ways

122
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:58,849
to weaponize the ability of what a pixel

123
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:01,430
can do for it so some of the things to

124
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:07,039
know of course there every read browser

125
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,479
knows about are very capable of query in

126
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,590
your system or whatever when you use the

127
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,240
web browsers as your IP previous sites

128
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,630
how fast your internet is your operating

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,520
system browser plug-ins hardware specs

130
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:22,250
it's actually kind of crazy with all

131
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,960
that can query for your CPU video

132
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,479
resolution battery level with

133
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,919
orientation of your device like I tell

134
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:34,880
my pads tablets cell phones of course

135
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:39,590
give away geolocation GPS they can also

136
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,419
do autofill for purposes of login one

137
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:46,130
thing that really took me by surprise is

138
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:49,310
your web browser will expose what sites

139
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:53,530
you stay logged into so if you're in a

140
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:58,210
social media like Facebook and Twitter

141
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,859
Amazon Microsoft you have the option to

142
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,349
stay logged in in the background all

143
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,500
those are visible to any website to

144
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,960
choose visit and they can query against

145
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,599
that and ask for what credentials you're

146
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,638
actually logged into so they can use

147
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,560
that to track you as you visit our

148
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,530
different sites that profile stands out

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,360
all right so flare your cpu and how much

150
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:23,020
ram and your resolution and your logged

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,659
into these seven sites you know that it

152
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,789
helps them track where you are so if I

153
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:30,610
visit Amazon and I hop over here - yeah

154
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,419
or go to over to Google they can pin

155
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:40,270
together the profile of your machine

156
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:43,448
from all that recorded data some of the

157
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:46,270
reasons and places use for pixels of

158
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,340
course their traffic analytics is you

159
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,770
know the big thing so I'm who's visiting

160
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,529
what what you doing along that way is

161
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,628
direct marketing you know if your stone

162
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:59,680
adds to a particular area you don't want

163
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:01,719
to sell parties in a commercial and a

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,129
non Hardee's environment right and so

165
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:05,979
you want to target the cities where you

166
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:08,610
want to promote your sales you know spam

167
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:12,460
costs for like email tracking that gives

168
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:16,409
back information you know who's opening

169
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,729
your webs or your emails and such and

170
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:21,430
another interesting thing I found out

171
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,438
was the document usage if you want to

172
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,120
track whether your users are actually

173
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,250
doing their jobs and working on the

174
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,689
documents they should be you can tag

175
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,939
your documents and every time they open

176
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:36,430
the document Microsoft Word and it's in

177
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:38,260
it Joey likes to pass on any geometry

178
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,620
that you'd like to record in Word

179
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:45,160
documents Mike most Microsoft suite auto

180
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:51,930
passes pixel tracking with no

181
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:54,339
qualms so we sit in the world of email

182
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,130
several companies have sprung up over

183
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,560
the last several years that allow for

184
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:02,890
email marketing tracking capabilities

185
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,369
like there's companies like yes we're

186
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,620
banana tag streak prob about seven or

187
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:12,790
eight and other to become pretty popular

188
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,590
over the years to slice you know so if

189
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,079
you wanted to do mass marketing email

190
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,670
for your company these companies step in

191
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,340
and tag all your email so that when they

192
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,990
visit they can say you know hey your

193
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,520
worker yeah they they sent out these

194
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,210
emails to these companies and these

195
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:32,740
amount of people open them very

196
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:34,420
interesting like said online surprises

197
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,850
imagine most everybody in this room is

198
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,479
pretty familiar just how bad different

199
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:44,590
companies are spying upon us cursing it

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,200
between the Amazon and Apple Facebook

201
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,880
and Google there's some information on

202
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,170
the slide there if you guys want to read

203
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,460
through but the couple informations

204
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,650
that's kind of interesting as most of

205
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,270
them have made publicly available how

206
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,550
much telemetry they have collected on

207
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:04,810
you so like at the bottom of there is

208
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,579
this Google you go to your account then

209
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,530
that website and it will tell you what

210
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,570
they've collected on you there's some

211
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:14,560
more in later and my slide deck to for a

212
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,790
belief Facebook and Amazon has one as

213
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,949
well it's a little bit more complicated

214
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:23,400
to get to but so some of the things that

215
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:27,250
I found the dark side of the pixels is

216
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,439
how people are abusing them of course

217
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,270
there's malware tracking banner

218
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,830
infections stereographic attacks

219
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:37,660
phishing attack information the word

220
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:41,050
documents also you know Microsoft

221
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:46,150
automatically passing information script

222
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:48,240
execution queries there's many different

223
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,020
ways to collecting information of course

224
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,779
but one thing that was really

225
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,069
interesting this is the matter

226
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:58,689
some of the more recent malware is

227
00:10:54,069 --> 00:11:00,810
utilizing they can track the spreading

228
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:03,879
of their malware they started passing

229
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,219
those like pixel calls throughout the

230
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,439
systems as they infect it so that each

231
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,360
one queries out currently basically its

232
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:18,399
beaconing you know people familiar with

233
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:20,110
web beacons and when I was first putting

234
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,949
this together it was probably month or

235
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,389
two before this report came out but our

236
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:28,329
bigquery or things I'd been discussing

237
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:31,779
with somebody was that they in a cloud

238
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:33,729
environment is who are you providing the

239
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,500
information to on your documents right

240
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,660
if somebody gets into your cloud

241
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,079
environment and was able to tag your

242
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,350
documents now they are receiving

243
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:48,399
telemetry whenever you open your cloud

244
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:50,259
documents right and so you know who's

245
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,209
that information going to is it your own

246
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,470
company providing that data or was that

247
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,719
somebody else has gotten into your

248
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,269
documents and the cloud point actually

249
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,920
had put out a warning that they were

250
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,559
starting to see attacks that where

251
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,979
people were placed in pixels and that

252
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,559
gives an adversary right the information

253
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,809
to who's opening the documents what

254
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,180
users are you know accessing it and you

255
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:15,490
know what their IP addresses are what

256
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,750
the computer names are giving them a

257
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,079
little bit more of a background

258
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:24,399
information over your site through the

259
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,750
cloud I would think from a riskless

260
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,819
standpoint that's you know you're

261
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,490
providing more efficient information for

262
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:33,160
them the better craft if I know sue and

263
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,939
HR opens this document every day on

264
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,089
Monday then you know for different job

265
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:42,250
postings or whatnot that would be

266
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:43,449
something I would want to watch or you

267
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,579
know somebody in the accounting

268
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,139
documents you know you find out who

269
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,579
works in the different departments that

270
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:50,949
aren't necessarily publicly available

271
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:52,279
information if you get access to their

272
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:58,229
cloud documents

273
00:12:52,279 --> 00:13:00,390
repertoire up till about a year and half

274
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,610
ago Microsoft didn't really care too

275
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:07,350
much despite people complaining for over

276
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:10,740
a decade but in the last couple of years

277
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,830
I started taking pixels in their

278
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,420
documents a little bit more seriously

279
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,160
for example us not as easy to place

280
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:22,079
anymore you need a third-party tool to

281
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:24,300
inject them now but you can still do it

282
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,850
but up until about a year ago which was

283
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:31,560
well before I regionally started on this

284
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,430
but they said some of the different

285
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,500
things that they can pull from your

286
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,160
documents but they the fact that

287
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,020
Microsoft is starting to realize that

288
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,550
they're kind of liable for giving away

289
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,579
some of that information by passing it

290
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,660
automatically right or they don't want

291
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,550
to be on the hook for it but there was a

292
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:54,540
Trojan and being passed around an office

293
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:56,399
365 the pixel called and documents where

294
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,110
they advised that you know if you

295
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,540
started pulling documents down locally

296
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,660
to view them and protected mode to

297
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,189
prevent those calls for me and made so

298
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:12,810
that that information is not passed

299
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:14,459
outside so some of the other weird

300
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,739
attacks had been over the last few years

301
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:20,339
there was a couple of attacks through

302
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:24,480
flash utilizing units and granite which

303
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:26,070
were different styles of tax one was a

304
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,399
backdoor allowed them to figure your

305
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:32,820
screen the other ones was targeting the

306
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,149
bank one of the ones I found pretty

307
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,190
interesting is countly which is a form

308
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:42,570
of JavaScript people were modifying real

309
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:46,100
heavily to circumvent antivirus and

310
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:49,750
detection because the JavaScript just so

311
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:53,680
scrambled it doesn't trigger

312
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:56,319
any of the previous skin algorithms or

313
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,800
hashes so they're not allowed for them

314
00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:03,189
to spin up things for like stereographic

315
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,128
attacks and actually pass the payloads

316
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:09,069
through pictures which we'll cover here

317
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:13,540
in a few moments of course javascript

318
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:15,939
and had taken on audience for a script

319
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,750
data mining injection which allowed a

320
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:22,149
query as to where they'd start checking

321
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,699
what other site to use in the background

322
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:27,329
and kind of download your hashes from

323
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:31,000
your web browser if you stored your

324
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:32,529
password in the browser then at least

325
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,379
gave them the hash to which they could

326
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,329
run against because it would auto submit

327
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:42,579
but you don't realize it's occurring

328
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:45,040
when you visit the website this is a

329
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,138
this is a tactic that I think happened

330
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,399
about probably about a year and a half

331
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:54,309
ago was a very small run the personnel

332
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,139
that found this it was targeting a bank

333
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:57,719
in South Korea but it only affected

334
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:03,939
about a hundred and eighty computer

335
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:05,559
handheld devices the people think that

336
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:07,629
the people were working on accidentally

337
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,649
let it slip out of their network or you

338
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:10,149
know that we're building the tool

339
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,370
because the tool wasn't completely

340
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:16,209
finished but what was kind of freaky

341
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:18,459
about it is that it was utilizing if

342
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,138
anybody's familiar what's on the right

343
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,138
side of their you know your right side

344
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:27,790
of the screen for you guys in the world

345
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:29,949
of graphics with that is a familiar with

346
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,879
what that is in the world of graphics

347
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,878
anybody

348
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:43,069
so it's a transparency pixel herb so so

349
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,180
just doing pixel they're doing an entire

350
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:49,969
image overlaid the login screen and

351
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:54,138
which they could record taps on the

352
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,970
device and have an XY coordinate now of

353
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,740
course it wasn't completely finished but

354
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,589
it was collecting data but it wasn't

355
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,180
doing anything with it so like if you

356
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:04,549
know when you clicked on there to put in

357
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,149
your login and your dressing EULA pop-up

358
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:07,220
keyboard

359
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,860
so then they have the XY coordinates

360
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,750
they could go back and map you know kind

361
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:16,819
of like a virtual key logger through

362
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,109
digital screen which is you know stuff

363
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,908
people are evidently working on because

364
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,490
it hasn't been seen since but it's been

365
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:24,650
a little bit over a year since the

366
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,909
initial outbreak of whatever it was they

367
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:32,090
were working on we were mentioned a

368
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:34,760
stereographic attack what's interesting

369
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,340
about this is I priced several you're

370
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,510
familiar with it but um each picture has

371
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:44,350
the RGB wider RGB for normal pictures or

372
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:48,950
whatever all those pixels are in binary

373
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:51,379
right and so you have 255 for green 255

374
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,390
for red and 255 for blue and you can

375
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,000
manipulate the last two bits without

376
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,090
actually affecting the colors enough for

377
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,610
most people to realize that that data is

378
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:07,760
been manipulated so malware code can be

379
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:11,120
added to my picture and be your actual

380
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,200
payload and on a website which actually

381
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,389
was utilized pretty recently and no late

382
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,669
in November confident and malwarebytes

383
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,659
Terry really liked seeing a large uptick

384
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:25,700
in an attack that they didn't understand

385
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:27,140
what was causing all the traffic but

386
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,600
they managed to trace it down this

387
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,610
little white bar on the top left of the

388
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,178
screen there is carrying a malware who

389
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,969
payload

390
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:41,669
which once it was decrypted or converted

391
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:45,190
from base64 back to an open SSL

392
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:50,370
decrypted and then removed another

393
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:54,159
base64 and then reverse the sass key the

394
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,989
hex to sass key with source code that

395
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,649
actually activated and downloaded the

396
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,330
payload for a chosen backdoor that was

397
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:05,979
spreading on a website and affected

398
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:10,178
primarily Mac devices an apple hidden

399
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:13,840
roughly 5 million users and on January

400
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:18,370
7th I believe so it was like one of the

401
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,928
more successful stereographic attacks

402
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:24,309
that's been seen and then like this some

403
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:30,070
of the source code in the bottom of what

404
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:33,250
it looked like and then the hash here

405
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:37,570
like the the base64 decrypted and then

406
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:43,570
the secondary payload where it actually

407
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:45,820
went out and grabbed the code I'm some

408
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,990
of the options so what you can do to try

409
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,879
to circumvent some of the data

410
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,669
collection on yourself from these

411
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,710
various things of course as web browsers

412
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,809
we usually have an incognito mode

413
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,640
nowadays that's not entirely foolproof

414
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:01,149
any longer is more and more people

415
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,830
develop they still think you're in

416
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:07,209
enough for your computer that they can

417
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:11,168
carry through that and using VPNs your

418
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:14,799
tour helps you know we please get rid of

419
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:16,510
your geolocation some of the things I

420
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,340
thought came across to is operating

421
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,140
systems some are a little bit more

422
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,870
versatile as some of you hear that

423
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,039
workaround right pattern familiar with

424
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:30,070
tens I assume it's a rating system

425
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,620
actually created here right patented as

426
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:36,250
a ram only operating system it's very

427
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,949
nice for being able to use any device or

428
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,930
any desktop PC or laptop that you can

429
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,330
and you have no access to the actual

430
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,910
hardware structure the operating system

431
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,659
runs entirely out of RAM so that leaves

432
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:52,580
no artifacts or than that part of the

433
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,260
website your browsers can't query

434
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,199
against because you have no access to

435
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,650
the physical hardware other than the RAM

436
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,050
drive that it's operating out of tales

437
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,210
and some other versions of Linux distros

438
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:10,310
that are been built for tried office

439
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:13,310
escape what you're doing on the web some

440
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:16,760
email plugins Thunderbirds one of the

441
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:19,220
nicer browser email utilities ironically

442
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,840
because that look doesn't carry Outlook

443
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,460
automatically passes all pixel tracks

444
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,139
there's a plugin for Chrome if anybody

445
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:35,750
uses Chrome as your email browser ugly

446
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:38,870
mail and then some other plugins now for

447
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,930
Chrome Firefox people of course Mac

448
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,389
users are proximally with Safari with

449
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:47,750
starting with hi sea air and introduced

450
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,700
intelligence tracking purrs engine which

451
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,370
was become a real big deal over the last

452
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,440
several years and that Facebook lost a

453
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:59,929
lot of revenue due to the fact that they

454
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:02,780
couldn't trace Mac or give ads to Mac

455
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:08,120
users because Safari Auto filters out

456
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:11,060
their ads which of course Facebook has

457
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:14,479
recently retaliated and will cover that

458
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,570
here in a few moments but there are

459
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,660
another bad blocker I've really enjoyed

460
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,510
up until last week was you block origin

461
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:27,470
if anybody's familiar with it it's been

462
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,750
a was a very powerful tool but Google

463
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:33,380
has decided to start targeting

464
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:36,110
third-party app blockers and it's on the

465
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,270
it's kind of not working so well in the

466
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,840
last two weeks due to some of the

467
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,840
changes done

468
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,559
so some of the controversy of course is

469
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,620
because you are blocking the ads various

470
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,299
websites and companies don't prefer to

471
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,580
allow you to view their website since

472
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,629
they're not making revenue off yet all

473
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:01,090
right

474
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:03,789
anybody here ever visit Forbes so when I

475
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,039
first started building that and trying

476
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:09,700
out some of these various tools I found

477
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,830
a very interesting that Forbes had what

478
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:16,960
Sawyer dated at 88 different vendors

479
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:19,539
just by hitting the home page so I wish

480
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,700
I had thought had the idea at the time

481
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,940
to have taken screenshots of that

482
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,429
because they have since masked what's

483
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,909
visible and but they had a really nasty

484
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:32,590
gram for using that blockers at the time

485
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:37,480
which at 88 I thought was a little

486
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:43,059
extreme myself but I said and then

487
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:45,960
there's a local channel there but so

488
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:48,549
Thunderbird has the built-in options

489
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,500
here's the settings for the security and

490
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:53,020
then you'll get these little when you

491
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,150
know there's a your email has a pixel

492
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,900
block in it get these little boxes

493
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,940
withdrawal squared broken gif files

494
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,179
basically where they're not able to make

495
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,480
the call the phone home in this case

496
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:09,730
this particular email had two of them

497
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:32,260
the most I've seen is actually eight and

498
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:35,159
one email through gleameil really

499
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,020
dissected into the email that heavily

500
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,610
because it's gotten so convoluted in

501
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,980
being able to actually have access to

502
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,780
the raw email at least from the tools I

503
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,840
usually i mean i just use Chrome

504
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,480
and Thunderbirds kind of archaic if

505
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:57,800
you're used to familiar me it's not very

506
00:24:50,480 --> 00:25:01,100
robust playing the wrong medium they're

507
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,050
all and it's just text only and so that

508
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,080
instead of the actual image kind of grew

509
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,060
it should see you should see the HTML

510
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,550
link what's left and a lot of times you

511
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,260
look at it and if you read it all the

512
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,050
way across there's a little section says

513
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:19,070
tracker or ID those are then continues

514
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:22,639
on to whatever and I was curious if you

515
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:26,149
had a to read on the right side there if

516
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,040
it had something similar to that I'm

517
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,380
tired I did not with some Thunderbird

518
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,909
myself primarily throughout I mean I

519
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,900
used to use Thunderbird several years

520
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:38,420
ago I got a car liked it from the fact

521
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,180
that it wasn't outlook right but but at

522
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,370
the same time it's not outlook and then

523
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:47,810
the real problem is is it doesn't do

524
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:51,979
exporting so if you change computers you

525
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:53,840
can't reinforce your mail at least at

526
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,400
the time I don't know if it's gotten

527
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,370
better over the last couple of years but

528
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,170
if you're you know is the fact that it

529
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,409
had built-in security features none of

530
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:05,120
the other ones do that for the purposes

531
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,550
of tracking it's the only browser that

532
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,850
does saw at least as of last year when I

533
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:12,680
was digging through that part but um

534
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,389
yeah as I say to say because

535
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,460
Thunderbirds a little bit more primitive

536
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,010
on the viewing stuff and raw modes a

537
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,850
little harder to do it might be in there

538
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,830
buried somewhere I didn't spend a whole

539
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,139
lot of time digging into like said

540
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,360
Thunderbird as well as I do a little bit

541
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:34,220
yeah I said outlook I would assume gives

542
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,379
you a an HTML link this is what ugly now

543
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,770
looks like it'll put a little I in front

544
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,770
of all

545
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:45,470
it's titles for your email so that

546
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:49,850
you're aware that if you open that that

547
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:52,190
you're going to trigger a response there

548
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,689
was another one I don't know if I had

549
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,820
written down but there was a pixel

550
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,010
something Oh give you a little red one

551
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,260
it'll actually let you it won't activate

552
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:04,280
it so you can actually go into the email

553
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:07,640
and then see what they are gostrey is an

554
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,220
interesting product gostrey due to the

555
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,350
fact that nobody really bought that or

556
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,380
pays for it for as a plugin for your

557
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:19,600
browsers they still do sell your

558
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:23,290
information but they have anonymized it

559
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:27,139
everybody likes that information right

560
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:29,750
so they're like so instead of saying hey

561
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,350
user so-and-so visited said site they

562
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:36,410
say yeah you know allegedly you know 50

563
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:39,949
people use this site today right so they

564
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,570
don't actually pass on depending on they

565
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,670
give you a breakdown of you know which

566
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,220
one do you want which is kind of

567
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,810
interesting so you can track and see

568
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,490
which the different analytic sites are

569
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:52,070
collecting the data when you visit a

570
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,070
visit a site and you can whitelist

571
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,560
whatever sites you want you know but

572
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,090
they're there they're still trying to

573
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,760
make money as well so they're trying to

574
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:04,100
stay afloat they openly admit now that

575
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,260
they sell your information but they just

576
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,879
they strip out your personal

577
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,760
informations and stuff and give a

578
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,750
general you know collection the data I

579
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,070
guess to the different companies pixel

580
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,750
blackness as well I was talking about I

581
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,149
didn't know if I start a slide left but

582
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,520
so it gives you the little red little

583
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:26,780
red mark in it then you can see and

584
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,160
highlight who it's beaconing out to or

585
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:32,960
whatever if you open it you can actually

586
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:34,310
go ahead and click it the source so you

587
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,690
can see cases whether it's more than one

588
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,040
it'll give you a list of the sources and

589
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,119
you can check mark if you want to

590
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:43,570
actually go ahead and send that pixel

591
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:47,499
why you might want to do that is if

592
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:49,899
you're signed up for ads like fries or

593
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:51,429
Micro Center or something like that they

594
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:53,649
don't know you're actually opening those

595
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:57,429
ads right because now you're blocking

596
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:59,439
that tracker so if you'd like to

597
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:01,629
continue to receive those ads or their

598
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,009
discounts or their or whatever you kind

599
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:04,928
of have to make an extra step to go

600
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:08,169
ahead and say yeah go ahead and let them

601
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:09,969
know that I opened this you know but you

602
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,219
know if anybody likes their free coupons

603
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:14,950
for micro Center I'm a fan of free USB

604
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:16,839
sticks so I occasionally click a couple

605
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:22,330
of those and let them go through you

606
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:24,719
know I think I missed one minute and

607
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:27,489
this is what you black origin looks like

608
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:30,629
puts the little shield up top you gotten

609
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:32,619
on the off button you can also whitelist

610
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:35,468
what sites you want to make available

611
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:38,468
the pass your information and then it

612
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:41,409
will give you a running count number of

613
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:43,899
every site that that particular page hit

614
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:46,659
count of how many trackers are on that

615
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:51,008
actual site sometimes those get really

616
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:53,909
large if you're a big fan of Xbox this

617
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:57,149
is ending their ad sites for X boxes

618
00:29:53,909 --> 00:30:01,690
ridiculous digits I think - same about

619
00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:06,580
485 over the courses and you may a xbox

620
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:08,919
an advertisement page really nice if

621
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:12,249
you're using YouTube or something like

622
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:15,940
that you get no commercials or ads it's

623
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:17,649
worked really nice up until I said from

624
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,059
everything I've used for up until two

625
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,418
weeks ago it was a great product is

626
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:24,789
still decent product for free you can't

627
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:27,309
knock it but I've noticed

628
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:29,339
whatever the backends that chrome is

629
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:29,339
doing

630
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:35,240
any pixels that are pictures that are

631
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:40,220
smaller than like a little speaker logo

632
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,290
are now like the little like red Xbox we

633
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,960
had a little bit ago so like you can't

634
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,700
tell what's your like your dropdowns or

635
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,520
what's your speaker control or your

636
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,020
minimize like if you're visiting YouTube

637
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:57,170
like all your little controls are

638
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:59,780
disappeared I would assume that the

639
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:02,570
people that help maintain this will

640
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:06,670
eventually fix this but also as a side

641
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:09,110
effect both Firefox and Chrome has

642
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:12,140
confessed that they're not doing Auto

643
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:14,060
updates for ad blockers anymore so if

644
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,800
you want to continue to maintain your ad

645
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,240
blockers you have to manually update

646
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,280
them yourself because they are

647
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:23,720
preventing those from auto updating any

648
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:27,740
longer as of about a month ago as they

649
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:32,030
are blaming speed that the ad blockers

650
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:34,310
are slowing down web traffic browsing

651
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:41,360
which let's see I got a slide there for

652
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:43,100
that I thank you yeah so they're claims

653
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,540
from Google of courses that the ad

654
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,760
blockers are slowing down the web

655
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,350
trafficking so much that it's not worth

656
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,150
your time to have them and that they

657
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,969
should build their own web blocker so

658
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:55,880
that of course Google's will pass their

659
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,600
own ads into their browser and block the

660
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,330
other people's ads here's some of the

661
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,490
time stamps of a third party the effects

662
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,919
of some of these ad blockers which I

663
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,890
can't quite see them from here but

664
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:14,230
ghostery is pretty low you block origin

665
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:16,580
I mean it's hundreds of a second I mean

666
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:19,130
happily put up with a hundred seven

667
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:22,280
millisecond do not see any ads when I

668
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,770
was visiting Facebook or YouTube or the

669
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,860
like

670
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:30,920
if you get into other browsers like was

671
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:34,760
a go duck or whatever DuckDuckGo gets a

672
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:38,720
little own brutal those are you know

673
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,150
eight seconds is a different story you

674
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,140
can't understand that that probably

675
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:49,220
would retire from using that that was

676
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,840
back up here there's another guy that

677
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:56,929
stunner gal I'm not sure but the Robin

678
00:32:52,840 --> 00:33:01,070
lioness has done a lot of work and has a

679
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:03,049
really recommends no script as a tool to

680
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,480
use in the background for blocking a lot

681
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,309
of this material what's neat about the

682
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,730
site and it was in the slide at the very

683
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:14,330
end but that you can actually visit

684
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:17,090
their site and run tests on to see what

685
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:20,418
kind of information is being passed from

686
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:23,270
your network by browsing the internet

687
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:26,770
and it'll actually give you solutions

688
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:29,030
for different things to plug if you

689
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,910
mostly miss grep will stop almost

690
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,830
everything but it at least give you an

691
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,690
idea what kind of information you are

692
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,730
leaking to the Internet one of the

693
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,590
things I thought was because I tried it

694
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,540
out on one of my boxes for creds and

695
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:45,649
giggles I let her run for like a 20

696
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:50,059
minutes it didn't find it in my pcs but

697
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:53,090
the fact that my TV's visible kind of

698
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:57,200
took me off-guard because of course IOT

699
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:58,610
devices aren't robust in security so the

700
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,120
fact that somebody could tell that I

701
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:04,580
have a samsung television just by this

702
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,070
is ending our website because it's on my

703
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:14,480
network was kind of an interesting

704
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:16,219
eye-opener Apple devices and I said with

705
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,649
the Safari and stuff like that they have

706
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:22,459
built-in that blocking they call it

707
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:25,129
limiting the ad tracking on their iPad

708
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,290
and iPhone and the settings to enable

709
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:30,649
that

710
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:34,070
the privacy badger I've not personally

711
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:36,199
used it yet but it's pretty similar to

712
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,649
you block origin you can do a whitelist

713
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:41,779
read list or you know neutral whether

714
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:48,168
I'm not Irish clear what the yellow does

715
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:51,169
but some other things too there's a like

716
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:55,850
pfSense firewall builds a module that

717
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:57,980
you can put in for blocker in G which

718
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:01,520
automatically block a lot of the pixel

719
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,870
tracking calls I played with it a little

720
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,360
bit I haven't spent a whole lot of time

721
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,009
making it work but there's an excellent

722
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,460
document there for anybody I'd like to

723
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:15,920
take that challenge it's several pages

724
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:20,600
long and very technical not big pfSense

725
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,120
so it was kind of but they keep you

726
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:26,569
entertained for a weekend or two if you

727
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:30,049
want to take a shot at it there's things

728
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:31,850
that came across to you in the later

729
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,760
editions of this is some of the effects

730
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:37,069
that pixel is having on artificial

731
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,660
intelligence right so because that's the

732
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:44,720
big thing now but the fact that you can

733
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:49,129
put a pixel in an image and it will

734
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,730
affect the a eyes ability to detect what

735
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,400
that image is right so it'll cause them

736
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,930
to miss class classified just by dot on

737
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,700
the tire and it changed from an

738
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:04,190
automobile to a dog you know putting a

739
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,589
dot on this dog and changing it to a cat

740
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:08,540
you know a horse to an automobile and

741
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:11,120
it's pretty interesting research so once

742
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,940
they get the three pixels in a picture

743
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,850
the most day I can't identify the image

744
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:19,880
any longer

745
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:24,410
so I was interesting

746
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:27,800
so yeah back in October taste announced

747
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:30,589
that they are no longer they implemented

748
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,180
what's called the Facebook pixel which

749
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,160
basically is they're given their

750
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:38,060
third-party advertisers first right

751
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,600
access to the data so that all ads come

752
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:45,340
through to the users as actual Facebook

753
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,339
traffic instead of a third party app

754
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,320
they've cut back how much ads they throw

755
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:56,600
at you but the fact that the now means

756
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:59,270
that if a third party ad has malware in

757
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,450
it the Facebook is passing it to you and

758
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:07,400
there's you know outside your browser's

759
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:10,310
bro you're a Z you know I think it's

760
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,340
kind of an interesting response to in

761
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:18,440
order to catalog and regain the revenue

762
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:20,210
from mac OS operating systems and of

763
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,190
course I'm sure they probably have

764
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,660
something negotiated with Google with

765
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,880
Google implementing their own ad

766
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,740
blockers and thought was very

767
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,960
interesting to and if anybody saw last

768
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:34,609
month but Google started putting ads on

769
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,440
their home page which I had never seen

770
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:40,640
before which is kind of bothered me as

771
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,410
well cuz I always went to Google was the

772
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,670
browser because there's no ads and now

773
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,089
they're starting to put an ad in the

774
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:49,220
bottom so but the fact that they're

775
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,720
giving first party access to everything

776
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,450
you do be able that means their third

777
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,549
party can trace and fingerprint your

778
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:58,240
computer just as you've visited their

779
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,240
own website

780
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,890
these were the plugin slowdowns more

781
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:07,170
recently this was I don't know how many

782
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:10,290
weeks back those Matt turned me on to

783
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:14,040
this a couple days ago gentlemen Joe

784
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:18,509
chasing him he has created a new tool

785
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:22,220
called subhuman which scans your system

786
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:24,630
for incoming pixel calls and then

787
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,390
anonymizes and bombards that site with

788
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:31,609
several thousand calls from around the

789
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:35,490
world clarion that email pixel track

790
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:39,330
found is an interesting solution to you

791
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:41,939
know mess with people that are you know

792
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:44,640
tracking you on the backend on your

793
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,410
emails I read through some of this

794
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,848
material pretty weird a couple days ago

795
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:51,598
or last night and her yesterday

796
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:54,000
yesterday morning or whatever a lot of

797
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,970
people say well aren't you kind of DDoS

798
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,070
in these ads nice like the same way that

799
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,959
you know his response of course was

800
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,480
while we didn't ask to be tracked in the

801
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,070
first place so you know which ground you

802
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,349
me hitting them with 3000 different

803
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:10,589
random places from around the world you

804
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:18,570
know to obscure you know where I opened

805
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:22,020
your actual email it's not as much as

806
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:23,250
like okay so your email advertisers

807
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,160
wanted to know when you open the email

808
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:28,890
so when you open the email just subhuman

809
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,430
will hit that thing with like two or

810
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:37,049
three thousand hits from random random

811
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:39,540
places on the web yeah so said hey

812
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,040
instead of getting one response with the

813
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,710
information you're trying to track I'm

814
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,390
giving you five thousand copies of me

815
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:49,260
opening that email every time I open

816
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:52,379
that email I was a very amusing thing

817
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,910
you know it's a fairly new github

818
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,260
there's the address on the bottom of

819
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,299
thing buddy wants to take a look to get

820
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:01,930
to work it's it's kind of an

821
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:05,819
interesting concept to start poking back

822
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:09,730
at people doing the pixel tracking and

823
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:11,440
everything that we're doing you know and

824
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,509
these were some useful interesting sites

825
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:19,599
that said the FF privacy Badgers

826
00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:23,559
considered pretty good that web ke Linus

827
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,210
Pro or Robin - I'm sorry that's let's

828
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:26,829
talk about theirs they got like eight

829
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,769
different categories of different tests

830
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:32,049
you can scan your system with the

831
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:34,538
courier letting them giving them

832
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:36,249
permission to scan your system right so

833
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:39,190
as much as you want to trust hitting a

834
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:39,819
ok button on a random website on the

835
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,299
Internet

836
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:45,279
have at it said my stuff I don't care

837
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:48,970
about too much but it did find my

838
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:51,849
television so that was a kind of an

839
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:54,488
eye-opener and then places like you know

840
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:58,720
the analytics to Google and YouTube of

841
00:40:54,489 --> 00:41:00,130
collected Anja and Facebook together the

842
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:08,848
sites while you're logged in they'll

843
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:11,470
show you what they've accumulated so but

844
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:16,140
if anybody's got any comments

845
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:16,140
suggestions or questions I'm always open

846
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:24,190
I can send them out I don't personally

847
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,379
got and post them anywhere I think they

848
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:31,330
were posted online from oh is f-from

849
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:34,240
we can't go so we want to make sure we

850
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:36,430
have permission to do so first sound

851
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,899
like we did a person it's the other

852
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:43,899
thing is that Adrienne is going on his

853
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:46,360
record of these and they will be on IV

854
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:49,120
Club Website yes oh and all the dirty

855
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,340
girls didn't moved a bit shoot you down

856
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,380
little multiplied sometime tomorrow yeah

857
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,960
so last year they were off with it and

858
00:41:53,380 --> 00:42:33,240
by the end of the day actually I think

859
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:35,800
you had before well of course that

860
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,060
actually there was one more thing I

861
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,950
wanted to add on this which was kind of

862
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,340
interesting but I forgot to look into it

863
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:44,980
too much but um anybody see the article

864
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,660
on LinkedIn this week about that they

865
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,610
have so much telemetry on us that they

866
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,779
can actually track us by our heartbeats

867
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:54,310
that everybody's heart beats so unique

868
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,070
that they can actually trace where we

869
00:42:54,310 --> 00:43:01,480
are based off our heartbeats and the

870
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:04,030
devices that can hear it yeah I thought

871
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,530
that was a little fun to dig him down a

872
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:10,080
little bit more but I meant to do that

873
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,080
before today but I forgot about it

874
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:24,038
what's that I said I didn't dig into the

875
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,240
actual thing there was an article on

876
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:29,749
LinkedIn this past week that a friend

877
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,839
had posted that they were that they have

878
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:34,519
collected so much intelligence honest as

879
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:36,950
they can trace us and know where we are

880
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:40,640
based on our heartbeat that that's a

881
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:43,399
unique identifier that can be used to

882
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,150
locate us kind of similar to facial

883
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,619
recognition I wish you could tell you

884
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,779
more about that was like I just hit that

885
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,069
and skimming and I didn't dig into as

886
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:54,859
much as I wanted to but I thought you

887
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:57,950
know you guys might be interested in

888
00:43:54,859 --> 00:44:00,230
hearing about it but I'm sure there's a

889
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,149
few articles up on various websites by

890
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:06,519
now because it was posted like Monday or

891
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:40,849
Tuesday you be something to look at

892
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:42,288
would you ask guess what you're trying

893
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:44,269
to say how easy it would be to

894
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:45,099
completely cover your tracks of what

895
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:50,299
you're doing

896
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:52,309
visiting the internet from the from a

897
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:53,569
few various people I've talked to if you

898
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:55,400
actually wanted to do something

899
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:58,308
anonymously on the Internet you need a

900
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,009
computer that you don't use exclusively

901
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:03,289
for that particular purpose preferably a

902
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:05,779
burner laptop that you don't use

903
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:10,530
actually plug into anywhere other than

904
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:12,810
your tor connections and

905
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,900
you know use public Wi-Fi and tunnel

906
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:17,640
somewhere else in the world and because

907
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,860
it's going to fingerprint that machine

908
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,680
enough that companies like Google or

909
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:27,600
Microsoft are going to be able to pull

910
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:29,339
serial numbers or MAC addresses or off

911
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,069
that device to such a point that it

912
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:37,470
doesn't really matter what you do after

913
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:39,690
the first day right I say once they

914
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,339
figure I mean that's I've had a friend

915
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,410
show me like once you plug something

916
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:46,980
into the computer in like 10 or 15

917
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:49,710
minutes there's a like Google token on

918
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,540
your device that lets them know then

919
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,690
fingerprinted you so once you've got

920
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,730
that token once you put your name or

921
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,170
some personal information into it it's

922
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,790
going to be tied to that token and that

923
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:05,430
token will be paired with anything else

924
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:07,310
that you've used yeah so I mean once you

925
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,759
once you put your name in the browser

926
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:11,610
BAM

927
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,440
you know that's tied to you I personally

928
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,470
have somewhere in the ballpark of 50

929
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,160
some computers which is a little

930
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:22,439
abnormal but so the fact that you know

931
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,250
my ability to obscure that is probably

932
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,950
really hard because I go out most of

933
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,290
mine are all in one place so but it does

934
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,990
make for an interesting way of trying to

935
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:36,980
surf the net anonymously you pretty much

936
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:41,450
have to have a device dedicated for that

937
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:45,230
now that you put zero information into I

938
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,230
would think at this point
