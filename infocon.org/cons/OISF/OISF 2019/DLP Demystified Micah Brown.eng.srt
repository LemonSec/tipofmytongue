1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:09,629
okay so we're gonna keep going with the

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,649
next presentation so Micah brown are you

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,840
didn't like it

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,039
okay can we get all the names come to

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,320
Kiel we just met today so so Mike is

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,050
gonna be our next presenter he said that

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,910
to keep his title or intro grow short so

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,490
just a shameless plug for there is a

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,890
organization so he's the vice president

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:38,610
of the Greater Cincinnati is a chapter

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,920
down in Cincinnati obviously so I say is

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,809
the information system security

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,649
Association and he's got to talk about

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:01:04,920
DOP demystified so I'm gonna let you put

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:01:06,689
these on and all right do you guys have

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,729
it's excellent am i coming through good

17
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,500
for you Adrian

18
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:13,049
excellent well once again my name is

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,790
Micah brown thank you for going through

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,790
and inviting me to be a part of today

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:24,360
all right I'm glad to be here

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,330
so I formerly work with Munich Re as 19

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,329
security engineer to for the past four

24
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,000
years I've been part of a DLP project

25
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:37,619
data loss prevention as the lead

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,259
engineer on that and other fun facts I'm

27
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,770
a huge barbecue fanatic so much so that

28
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,630
last year one of my official goals for

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,149
my organization under personal

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,329
development was learned to cook brisket

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,840
like a Texan I'm glad to say that I met

32
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,139
and exceeded that goal in full that

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,000
being said a shameless plug we have a

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,040
lot of good things going on in

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,850
Cincinnati with local IT security groups

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,770
Matt berry myself we all run a group

37
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,899
come great friends at these types of

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,299
conferences and others we run around and

39
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,580
we have so much fun so I urge you find

40
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,400
those groups find those people that make

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,630
your personal and professional life just

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,110
a little bit better

43
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,630
I want to thank Barry and Matt and Gary

44
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,459
for all their help and support and we'd

45
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,040
love to have you at any one of our

46
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,060
meetings if you're ever in the area

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,980
that being said data loss prevention now

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,480
for those of you that are new to this

49
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,810
I'm sorry this is a data centric talk

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:47,609
however misery loves company that being

51
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,980
said what is DLP well anymore

52
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,730
data loss prevention it's not a

53
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:57,119
monolithic stack of technology from one

54
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:00,298
single organization it is not meant to

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,590
stop a sufficiently advanced adversary

56
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:06,660
it is not digital rights mem management

57
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,670
is not in use or behavioral analytics

58
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,739
and it is not a silver bullet

59
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,440
what DLP is is more and more it's

60
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,760
starting to become a feature in terms of

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,380
what technology is putting in or what

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,780
various solutions are putting in to

63
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,030
allow a business to control how data

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,180
stored process and transmitted within

65
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,459
their organization in many ways I've you

66
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,640
as data loss prevention as really more

67
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,579
of a business tool the IT security might

68
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,890
go through might have ownership of from

69
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,590
an administrative perspective from an

70
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,518
incident or event response protective

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:48,989
but really is a function of the business

72
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:52,799
in and of itself so the Golden Triangle

73
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:55,950
of data loss prevention is we want

74
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,350
technology in order to go or to allow us

75
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,988
to go through and control how we store

76
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,440
how we process and how we transmit data

77
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:08,069
within our environment that being said

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,519
in many DLP environments this is done by

79
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,060
very or by different actors by different

80
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,250
technologies throughout

81
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,720
so the very first one is the DLP client

82
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,839
so this is a piece of software that sits

83
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,400
on your client systems and interacts and

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,530
it's mainly watching and enforcing

85
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,900
policies on how your end users are

86
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,409
interacting with data so this would be

87
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,429
something to the effect of permitting or

88
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,630
blocking access to external peripherals

89
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,700
looking at information that you're

90
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,290
writing to an external peripheral and

91
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,419
seeing if there's any sensitive

92
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,120
information and then making them allow

93
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,729
an alert or a block decision but it can

94
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,980
also do things such as go through them

95
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,480
force controls whenever someone takes a

96
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,530
screen capture go through and do

97
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,630
inspection on emails that they're

98
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,179
sending on web posts that they're that

99
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,770
they're sending the next one is DLP

100
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,500
network so I often go through and I tell

101
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,299
people the DLP network that's kind of

102
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,590
like our traditional IDs systems and

103
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,400
we've gotten really good when it comes

104
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:12,340
to ids/ips and so a DLP network device

105
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,659
will go through an ingest packets on a

106
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,789
particular part of your network

107
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:20,410
generally you're going to use something

108
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:23,110
like a spam port tab or if your you've

109
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,880
got a lot of good technology maybe you

110
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,910
might have a packet an aggregator that's

111
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,310
feeding these DLP networks however where

112
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,330
an IDs IPS is looking at potential signs

113
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,650
of attack and the DLP network monitor is

114
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,330
going to go through and it's going to

115
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,780
look for potentially sensitive

116
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,789
information traversing the network the

117
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,979
DLP repository scanner so this is

118
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:47,800
usually a server or their twelve lines

119
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:50,020
that you spin up and it has a special

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,539
software component that you point it at

121
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,430
a repository and data repository this

122
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,669
could be a database server this could be

123
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:01,000
a traditional share and as this could be

124
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:03,599
a something such as a SharePoint and

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,220
it'll scan every file in that repository

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,000
against your defined classifications and

127
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,680
then it'll either make an alert or take

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,450
some sort of prescriptive action we'll

129
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,479
talk about that in a little bit later

130
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,979
DLP email kind of simple it's kind of

131
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,380
like

132
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:23,100
antivirus on our email so you've got

133
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,860
this either server or applying virtual

134
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,780
appliance they'll partner with your mail

135
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,490
server and it'll go through an ill

136
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,320
perform DLP checks on every email sent

137
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,450
and/or received by your organization I

138
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,340
honestly think that there's value of

139
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:43,560
scanning inbound inbound emails inbound

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,090
traffic into your environment against

141
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:51,360
DLP because what I have found is that

142
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,859
this has helped me and discover actual

143
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,920
events where we had sensitive

144
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,290
information coming in suboptimal methods

145
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,590
and in order to go through and address

146
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,970
that we first have to be aware of that

147
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,460
finally we go through the FDA or not

148
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,260
finally we have DLP webs so this is once

149
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,260
again usually a server or virtual

150
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,890
appliance that we go through and it will

151
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,980
form a bond with any proxy that you have

152
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:20,789
to do DLP activities against any web

153
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:23,280
traffic being sent and or received from

154
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,350
your local environment and finally we

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,960
have the DLP management console and guys

156
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,450
this is one that we really need to pay

157
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,659
attention to because the DLP management

158
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:36,570
console this is kind of like the puppet

159
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,760
master it's the piece of the puzzle that

160
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,920
goes through and coordinates all the

161
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,810
other parts of data loss prevention

162
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,000
together this is where we go through and

163
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,700
we define what our policies are what our

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,690
data classifications are as was where we

165
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,640
go through and we store our DLP

166
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,350
incidents and guys the DLP incidents

167
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,320
keep in mind what is the lp designed to

168
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,110
do it's defined areas where very

169
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,150
sensitive information is going through

170
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,800
your network in an unauthorized manner

171
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,409
and those usually manifests themselves

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,450
as DLP incidents inside the DLP

173
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,940
management console so we need to go

174
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,010
through and acknowledge that we're going

175
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,700
to have very sensitive information both

176
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:22,140
primary information things like HIPAA

177
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,880
GLBA PCI NPI in DLP incidents directly

178
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,010
but we're also going to have secondary

179
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,529
information like where that data was

180
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,469
flowing where it was stored and you

181
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,659
believe me if I were to put on my black

182
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,088
hat and I got access to the management

183
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,240
console and I saw that there was a

184
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,399
particular HR file that had personally

185
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,829
identifiable information in this one

186
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,689
folder in this one file what are the

187
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:47,219
chances that other information in that

188
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:49,800
folder would be likely as valuable

189
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,899
chances are pretty good so we need to

190
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,719
make sure that we protect our DLP

191
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,220
management console sufficiently to go

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,709
through make sure that we meet any rules

193
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,819
laws or contractual obligations that we

194
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:08,069
are under so one of the challenges that

195
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:09,180
I've had in implementing this is why

196
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:12,800
don't we just do everything on the

197
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,040
client it seems like today we have seen

198
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,258
two big trends in the IT security

199
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,709
environment now one is going through and

200
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:25,459
focusing on the actual client and the

201
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:27,869
other is doing data for first

202
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:32,430
methodologies and I defined DLP as a

203
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,990
data first methodology and so there are

204
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,649
some challenges with doing everything on

205
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:41,519
the client for example we go through or

206
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:44,459
with our particular DLP solution we go

207
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,129
through and we have an option to do 12

208
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:50,160
data protection rules we've only turned

209
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:52,379
on one to add significant value to us

210
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,360
the other ones just don't function in a

211
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:56,309
way that actually add value they

212
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,930
actually add work to us so there are

213
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:03,569
negative so we need to understand what

214
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,359
DLP any one of those points what value

215
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:08,339
is it going to go through and add to us

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,279
secondly when we go through and we turn

217
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,929
on especially the data protect rules

218
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,199
we're actually going through and we're

219
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:19,110
every action that the user takes could

220
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,729
potentially add a DLP skin which is

221
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,529
going to affect the compute cost of

222
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,350
those computers in terms of CPU memory

223
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,290
disk i/o network i/o so we need to go

224
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,059
through and make sure that we keep our

225
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,248
actual client configuration as

226
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,839
lightweight as possible that way we are

227
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:35,310
not going through and we're introducing

228
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,990
latency and

229
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,640
problems for the rest of the business

230
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:44,370
now guys I love third-party software and

231
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,470
I love Chrome and I love Firefox the

232
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,060
problem is is that Google for all the

233
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,450
good that they are doing in our industry

234
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,760
they are very protective of chrome in

235
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,810
and of itself so much that the very

236
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,460
first day that my DLP vendor goes

237
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,709
through and gets an update to Google

238
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,150
Chrome is the same day that my end-users

239
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,779
are getting that update to Google Chrome

240
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:10,170
and one thing that actually happened to

241
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:13,610
us is that Google significantly changed

242
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:18,209
how chrome worked and overnight our

243
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:20,430
chrome became incompatible with our DLP

244
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,730
client solution and it resulted in

245
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,479
crashes now guys I was put in a position

246
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:30,720
where I had two other utter the words to

247
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,460
our local Desktop Services I understand

248
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,310
that there is an incompatibility

249
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,230
however we should be telling our users

250
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,459
that the officially supported browser is

251
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:46,470
Internet Explorer who wants to be that

252
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:50,460
guy not me but I did say that and

253
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:53,490
technically that is still true and the

254
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,200
problem was is Google change the

255
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,170
underpinnings on how Chrome was working

256
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,530
so during that time my DLP vendor had to

257
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,660
go through and reverse engineer Google's

258
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,459
Chrome new version so that they knew

259
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,620
where to set their hooks so that they

260
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,540
could provide DLP services so in that

261
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,970
case what was our solution well we're

262
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,069
going to move wett inspection off of the

263
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,080
client and move it up on to a network

264
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,660
level through something like a DLP

265
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,610
network device that actually has worked

266
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,819
out pretty good you're going to get some

267
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,400
applications that just don't work and in

268
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,500
fact where we ran into this was really

269
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,829
with our developers so we had to go

270
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,380
through and create what we call trusted

271
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,120
application templates for several tool

272
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,890
development tools and basically what

273
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,320
that says is hey DLP don't mess with

274
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:46,490
these processes they're no good

275
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:49,860
and finally excuse me we also have

276
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,500
conflicts when it comes to other what I

277
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,720
refer to as more DLP enterprise so

278
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,260
depending on where you're intercepting

279
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,150
with the DLP network monitors you're

280
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,069
going to go through and you could have

281
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,439
overlap and duplication of incidents

282
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,710
with things like your DLP web and your

283
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,900
DLP email just on what traffic your

284
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,740
actual DLP monitors are going through

285
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:16,380
and seen once again be mindful that the

286
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,480
DLP management console is going to hold

287
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,120
a lot of very sensitive information and

288
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,720
we need to have our additional controls

289
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,920
to make sure that that is not abused as

290
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:32,010
well as many systems are now adding DLP

291
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,530
light functionality to their environment

292
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:37,530
so we as administrators we as IT

293
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:41,160
security practitioners need to decide do

294
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:43,949
we want to use a single DLP policy stack

295
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,800
to architecture to enforce all of our

296
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,660
data loss prevention or do we want to

297
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,109
write to our DLP program in such a way

298
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,850
that we can use multiple different DLP

299
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,460
scan engines and that's going to lead to

300
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,440
some challenges initially our

301
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,930
organization went through and we were

302
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,110
using one single vendor up and down the

303
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:08,550
stack which that has some pros it has

304
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:11,100
some cons it means that as a plus where

305
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,560
you go through and we are have

306
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,470
consistent classifications across all of

307
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,839
our environments as a con we are

308
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,750
actually choosing to limit our

309
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,180
functionality to just that one vendor

310
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,710
and we'll talk about some of this but

311
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,870
now we're in a situation where we're

312
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:32,040
looking where we actually have two DLP

313
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:37,140
environment and we're looking to add

314
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:39,120
four in total by then in about 18 months

315
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:43,170
so we'll talk about the trade-offs there

316
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,230
as we talk a little bit later so the

317
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,839
number one thing that we need to do

318
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,940
is to define our goals and to define it

319
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,730
clearly so I just got back from a trip

320
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,060
to Munich and one thing that was

321
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:59,090
interesting is paying attention as I was

322
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,910
in the airport and I saw a poster for a

323
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,580
data loss prevention product and it

324
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,990
showed a businessperson mid-flight

325
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,860
looking like they're running to their

326
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,560
office and they had the typical tag

327
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,320
lines of that now more than ever our

328
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,430
data is one of our competitive

329
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:22,850
advantages and this companies DLP stops

330
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:26,420
the bad guys from stealing are stealing

331
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,730
your data and put yourselves in our

332
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,170
executive shoes how many times a day do

333
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,350
we care about breaches and that they're

334
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:37,699
a significant issue we hear that all the

335
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:40,010
time so many records were lost and so to

336
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,220
an executive if they hear a tool called

337
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,569
data loss prevention that's naturally

338
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,290
going to go through and be very

339
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:51,170
attractive to them right so what we need

340
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:54,530
to do as IT and IT security we need to

341
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,750
shape and provide the true value of what

342
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:59,030
can these the tools do for us because

343
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,500
they can do a lot of good but they're

344
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:05,180
not a silver bullet so during our

345
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,070
project over four years we had the

346
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,420
project run many different ways it

347
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,180
started out that we had a program

348
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,069
coordinator that ran it that wanted to

349
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,260
be a program coordinator half the time

350
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,220
and half the time wanted to be a project

351
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,530
manager we had an issue where the senior

352
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,080
management started to get frustrated

353
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,420
with the actual speed of the project and

354
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,180
so they started to make decisions that

355
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,370
had adverse effects because they didn't

356
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,520
understand the full ramifications of

357
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,460
those decisions until finally I stepped

358
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:41,449
up and I took over the roles of both the

359
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,220
actual lead engineer in the lead program

360
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,590
manager and what that did is that

361
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,190
allowed me to control the actual

362
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,740
narrative

363
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,890
just to say definitively this is what we

364
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,750
can do and to paint the consequences of

365
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,060
those and truly

366
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,490
that was one of the most effective ways

367
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,319
to run it because we were able to

368
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,110
control the narrative to make sure that

369
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:06,619
we were educating all business partners

370
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:10,039
as to what the intent of DLP actually

371
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:12,139
was we need to be very clear and defined

372
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:16,669
exactly what functionality we're turning

373
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:20,419
on for example the Cree is a global

374
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:23,419
company so when we take a look at the

375
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:27,049
global implications I believe it is fair

376
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:30,799
to say that the European Union has much

377
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:33,200
more progressive data privacy rights

378
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,970
than we do here in America and that's

379
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,600
manifested actually in our DLP

380
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,760
regulation where in the Americas we have

381
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,889
a rule that says when a person writes a

382
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,408
file to a piece of portable media we

383
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,450
check it to see if there's any critical

384
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,070
or any classified information any

385
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,650
sensitive information written in that

386
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,230
file and/or folder and if there is we

387
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,870
allow the write but we create a DLP

388
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,720
incident on the back end we're not

389
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,389
allowed to roll that out anywhere else

390
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,159
in the globe because of data privacy

391
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:09,289
concerns in terms of our rules laws and

392
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,870
regulations we see things like the

393
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,370
California consumer Privacy Act and yeah

394
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,850
I think that might actually have some

395
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:20,209
futuresplash damage for us so we'll have

396
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:22,428
to keep that very interests or keep that

397
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,640
in play we need to go through and we

398
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:28,520
need to invite not just IT to the table

399
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,070
but inviting the various business units

400
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,289
inviting HR inviting legal to the table

401
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,960
because each one of them at the end of

402
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:38,179
the day our owners of their data they

403
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,799
are data stewards we need to tell them

404
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:42,140
this is the capabilities this is what we

405
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:44,690
can do for you and work with them to

406
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,520
make sure that any rules that we put out

407
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:51,100
any policies we published through DLP

408
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:56,299
actually adds value to the business

409
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:58,949
so in our environment there was what I

410
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,658
refer to as the great potato een

411
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,029
and this was within the first year that

412
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,909
we turned on the environment luckily we

413
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:08,580
only had a sample of about 15 computers

414
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:11,309
but these were all security users up to

415
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,590
the very height of IT security as well

416
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,440
all the way down to me and some of my

417
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:19,259
colleagues and because I made a single

418
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,929
logic err in a data classification that

419
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:24,299
was akin to leaving that one single

420
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:26,820
parenthesis in a data classification I

421
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,700
introduced a memory leak that over a

422
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,178
period of 35 minutes turned each and

423
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,859
every one of our computers into a potato

424
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:40,109
so we so we need to be very very careful

425
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:42,720
when we're making any type of changes to

426
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:46,889
our environment so to help go through

427
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,509
and to correct that we set up a test

428
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:50,639
environment with its own test

429
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:53,639
classifications with its own test rules

430
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:55,678
we set up a pilot group with its own

431
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:57,840
pilot classifications with a doe its own

432
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,970
pilot rules and a production environment

433
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,029
with its production classifications and

434
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,970
production rules as we grew and rolled

435
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:08,190
that out not just to the Americas but

436
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,950
globally we had to go through and we had

437
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,049
to create that same three policy

438
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,119
architects or each containing their own

439
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,509
unique revisions of rules and its own

440
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:23,999
unique for vision zuv classifications

441
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:26,519
for our APEC and our NIA location so now

442
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:29,100
we have nine different environments each

443
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,619
with different classifications each with

444
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,279
different rules so every time you

445
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:37,408
fragment a policy you're adding

446
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,029
complexity and support issues for

447
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:40,859
yourself

448
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,109
however you need to determine what the

449
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:44,759
correct level of fragmentation is for

450
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:48,629
you and your environment so that when

451
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,720
you go through and when you do implement

452
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:53,639
it you are doing it in a manner in which

453
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,220
adds as much value to the business and

454
00:20:53,639 --> 00:21:00,719
makes it so that you prevent events like

455
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:04,940
the great potato in them so there was

456
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,940
one decision when we were run

457
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,590
the actual project from senior

458
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,710
management on down they were getting a

459
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,209
little bit frustrated with the actual

460
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,100
time it was taking to do our initial

461
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,670
rollout and they came to me and said

462
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,610
Micah we need to go on this day and so I

463
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,740
said I hear that I do have some concerns

464
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,709
about our availability to go through and

465
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,000
to respond to DLP events but give me 24

466
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,200
hours and I can quantify those for you

467
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,160
when it comes to DLP we're putting

468
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,510
ourselves at a very interesting decision

469
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,310
how are we treating DLP in our

470
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,830
environment is that what I refer to as

471
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:45,800
an active defense tool set in which we

472
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,980
are going through and we are required to

473
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,600
look at each and every alert or is it a

474
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,760
historical sim where we're just keeping

475
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,959
a record of what happened in our network

476
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,000
that way if we ever need to go through

477
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,290
and query we've got those answers right

478
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,510
there if we were involved in a breach

479
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:07,909
and it was found that we had alerts but

480
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,920
no one was looking at those alerts is

481
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,850
that a lack of due care or is that

482
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,620
negligence

483
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,629
that's not something for Micah the

484
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,939
engineer to decide that's something that

485
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,290
the business needs to decide and make

486
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,460
sure that we build the environment so

487
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,639
that we can go through and we can

488
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:26,210
support it and we can be successful so

489
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,800
when every when they came to me and they

490
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,340
said that we want to go live I said oh

491
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,149
alright

492
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,669
that's fine you want to go alive I went

493
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,060
through I calculated how many incidents

494
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:41,740
did the average user creating a day and

495
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:46,810
that was 96 I didn't did the math and

496
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:50,270
calculated that what's the number 4235

497
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:52,250
with a number of DLP engineers that we

498
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,050
would need to go through and respond to

499
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,000
each of those incidents assuming that we

500
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,990
were only looking for incidents made

501
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,990
during eight to five

502
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,270
we are actually hiring but not that

503
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,430
number they said this is unacceptable

504
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,560
what do we need to do I said it's quite

505
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,950
simple we need more time to go through

506
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,450
and to tune the environment and so they

507
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,180
saw that they said good that's what we

508
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,010
need to do so the moral of this story is

509
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,160
we need to build through and we need to

510
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:26,020
present the challenges that we're facing

511
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:30,400
to management in a term that they can

512
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:33,580
understand and that was as inflammatory

513
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,630
as as told us that number was it did get

514
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:40,840
the message across and now after we did

515
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,790
many many rounds of tuning we're down to

516
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,439
about three incidents a week per person

517
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,330
I'd all right assert that that's

518
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,120
something that is much much much more

519
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,790
manageable my good friend man who you

520
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,469
just heard before anytime somebody comes

521
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,780
on to the DLP project there are a couple

522
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,000
videos that I give them I give them this

523
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:02,139
slide deck to read through I give them

524
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:11,020
maps in 2017 regex 101 talk from Derby

525
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:15,190
Khan and those are some critical

526
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:17,260
on-ramps when I'm doing this tuning we

527
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:21,550
need to acknowledge that there is a risk

528
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:24,310
in over tuning and what I mean by over

529
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:28,030
tuning is we tweak a rule so much so

530
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:29,800
that actions on the environment that

531
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,010
should have created an alert and alert

532
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:36,790
do not longer create a more I'd rather

533
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:40,150
go through and create a ton false

534
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:44,409
positives than actually introduces a

535
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:47,050
true negative so any time that I'm doing

536
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:51,220
tuning activity I'm very conscious and I

537
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:54,460
ask myself if I were an end user could I

538
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,460
use this tuning to go through in to

539
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,310
subvert the actions of DLP and that I

540
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:03,460
use that as a guiding rule now if you

541
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:06,929
ever work at any time with me you will

542
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,310
get immensely annoyed with

543
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,710
often I say that because but I truly

544
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,020
believe now there are no false positives

545
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,690
only poorly written rules when I look at

546
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,730
a DLP event I do a couple things first

547
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,490
off I go through and I try to strip a

548
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:24,820
human emotion out of it I go through I

549
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:27,130
take a look at the actual event I take a

550
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,520
look at what the rule is I take a look

551
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:33,490
at what the actual data that was that

552
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:36,460
into that event or and I ask myself if I

553
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:39,550
were following those logic commands do I

554
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,320
agree in most of the time I do anytime

555
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,629
that I've seen it true false positive

556
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,250
it's been because of a bug but if you

557
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,370
think about it how long have we been

558
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:51,310
doing computer based logic we've been

559
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,750
doing it for a lot of time and we've

560
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:56,080
gotten really good at creating these

561
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:59,560
logic views so my default assumption is

562
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,270
there are no false positives only poorly

563
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,830
written rules and I think there's a

564
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,840
danger to labeling things that's false

565
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,639
positives that are really badly written

566
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,080
rules why because we're going through

567
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,710
and we are undermining the validity of

568
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,050
our tools we're saying that our tools

569
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:20,230
are giving us bad information that we

570
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:23,080
cannot trust our tools and we should not

571
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:26,170
undermine those that instead what I did

572
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:29,620
is I started to introduce validity and

573
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:32,980
accuracy where validity did we get the

574
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:36,540
result that we expected and accuracy

575
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,730
asking is the detection is the alert

576
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:42,879
mathematically correct and what that

577
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:46,030
small tweak does is it puts us in a

578
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,370
default standpoint that we need to go

579
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:50,080
through it and we need to improve our

580
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,540
tools that we need to tweak our tools

581
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,520
our classifications first is just saying

582
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,010
that the tool is adding a bunch of noise

583
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,800
it's adding a bunch of false positives a

584
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,990
bunch of extra work so I think that is

585
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,450
actually a critical mind shift that I

586
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:07,420
would suggest that you'd think about

587
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:11,670
adopting because it's actually promoted

588
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:14,260
a lot more how do I want to say this a

589
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,870
different attitude in where

590
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,390
now my DLP team instead of say no that's

591
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,070
just the false positive throw it away

592
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,020
saying you know this detection

593
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:27,040
it was suboptimal but maybe we could

594
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:33,389
tweak the rules in order to improve our

595
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:37,379
algorithms so with that being said

596
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:40,690
traditional DLP policy is based on

597
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:43,960
regular expressions word dictionaries

598
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,030
and boolean logic and in truth we were

599
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,970
getting pretty good at that but it does

600
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,790
have some limitations for example in the

601
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,410
United States of America we have fifteen

602
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,450
different states there are each allowed

603
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,830
to go through and to create their own

604
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,920
driver's license

605
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,990
any way or shape that they want to in

606
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,820
trust me there are differences I'll

607
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:06,400
actually show you our secret sauce on

608
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:10,960
how we define them likewise many of our

609
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:13,150
social media and large internet content

610
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,870
providers go through and use a fifteen

611
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:19,570
to sixteen digit or numerical code to

612
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,149
reference content what does that look

613
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,020
like to a computer it looks like a

614
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,850
credit card right

615
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:29,110
in fact I've gone through and I took a

616
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:31,360
sample of these types of alerts and I

617
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,560
even ran them to the lung check and many

618
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:38,500
of them came out as valid credit cards

619
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,240
traditionally or that leads me to

620
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,520
believe that in and of itself a

621
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,380
traditional data classification based on

622
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,230
regular expression text dictionaries and

623
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,850
boolean logic is not enough and we need

624
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:52,750
to be able to go through and do better

625
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:54,610
now one thing I will urge you is

626
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,710
whenever you go through and you create

627
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,290
your own custom classifications follow

628
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:02,860
the primary rule of improv comedy always

629
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:05,800
say yes and then we'll get to an issue

630
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:08,320
where I broke that rule and it really

631
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,540
caused a lot of problems and finally

632
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,439
proximity rules can be your friends so

633
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,830
this is where you're looking for

634
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,080
condition a and condition B to be true

635
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,439
within so many characters of yourself

636
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,840
whether it's 90 100 200 but just linking

637
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,120
to contents

638
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,409
to be close to each other that is hugely

639
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,530
powerful so guys right here is how I go

640
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:34,500
through and I write our DLP rules so

641
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:38,310
over on the left-hand here I go through

642
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:42,510
and I write what the classification name

643
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:46,440
is I give a quick description of what it

644
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:48,780
is or what it's looking for followed by

645
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,120
what type of rules so you can see this

646
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,430
is a proximity right here we're just

647
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,350
looking for an advanced pattern right

648
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:59,220
here's a dictionary plus an advanced

649
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,629
pattern and the truth is is that when

650
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,160
you see these rules there's nothing

651
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,780
magical about them in fact they're

652
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,170
pretty easy to understand once I walk

653
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:10,800
you through so over here you can see in

654
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:13,400
terms of advanced patterns or regular

655
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:18,060
expressions we have each one of these

656
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,590
individual blue entries is a different

657
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,419
regular expression dictionary that we

658
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,280
have so we're looking for one of these

659
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,010
regular expression dictionaries and

660
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,050
something from a text dictionary there's

661
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:32,010
less than 90 characters from each other

662
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:34,350
and found at least once in truth I go

663
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:38,700
through and when I go through and I run

664
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:41,550
say a scan or I have an auditor internal

665
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,080
or external asked me how DLP works I

666
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,200
give them this she and I walk through a

667
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,939
couple examples because once you go

668
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,080
through this it's pretty easy to

669
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,120
understand why these rules why these

670
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,240
alerts trigger and it's pretty easy for

671
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,550
the business or in auditory someone from

672
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,750
IT to understand how we are building our

673
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,020
rules and how we can go through and

674
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:07,320
improve them one thing that I will go

675
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:10,350
through and suggest to you is when we're

676
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,419
going through and we are looking you can

677
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:16,439
see that I take a couple shortcuts so at

678
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:18,630
the start of every custom building block

679
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,750
that I'd put in I tagged it with a short

680
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:24,300
code so CL T stands for client then this

681
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:28,460
is version 11 and de f stands for

682
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,649
default so just by the short tag I know

683
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,970
there it's part of our client

684
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,790
environment or the enterprise

685
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,130
environment I know what revision that

686
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,960
DLP rule was written under and I know

687
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,960
what specific environment whether it's

688
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,570
our test pilot or default likewise at

689
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,910
the end I tagged it with another code so

690
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,909
right here you see the XP are right here

691
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:52,910
you see txt exp R stands for regular

692
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:55,610
expression TX T stands for text so just

693
00:31:52,910 --> 00:32:01,160
by looking at the name my DLP analysts

694
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:02,929
can understand exactly what that part is

695
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,030
as well as where it is applied within

696
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,850
our environment so I found that to be

697
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:09,470
invaluable and I'd suggest that you take

698
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,750
that simple hack with you

699
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,720
so the tyranny of the driver's license I

700
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:17,570
promise to you this over here on our

701
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,640
left these are how we define our drivers

702
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,260
license you will find 26 different

703
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,020
drivers license by the way I forgot to

704
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,930
mention this all these slides are out on

705
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:31,250
my github free please feel free to beg

706
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:33,080
borrow or steal that being said those

707
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,520
were that's how we go through and we

708
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,500
defined driver's license however there

709
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:42,740
was some challenges things like our

710
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:44,570
incidents our user IDs our service desk

711
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,120
tickets our quality controls this

712
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:50,419
tickets are change tickets something as

713
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:55,040
simple as your year year day day day

714
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:57,740
month month or excuse me this was day

715
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,070
day month month year year year go

716
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,330
through and were matching our actual

717
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,710
driver's license definition so we had to

718
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,610
go through and we had to exclude them

719
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,230
remember when I told you that I broke

720
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:13,219
the first rule of improv comedy

721
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:16,190
that's this story so in the past we had

722
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:19,040
a concept of a driver's license just

723
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,780
being a match on one of those regular

724
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,300
expressions in that regular expression

725
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,649
dictionary and we started to go through

726
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,990
and as we tuned

727
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,400
even as we tuned out certain patterns

728
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,050
we're gain other things that were

729
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,140
matching things like telephone numbers

730
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:35,060
fax numbers so what we did is we created

731
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,860
a driver's license classification and

732
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,360
we've created a not driver's license

733
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,320
classification and the nut drivers

734
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,490
license classification

735
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,470
still going through we're going through

736
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,540
and we were looking for the exact same

737
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,430
regular expression plus the text

738
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,620
dictionary that Wooding that would go

739
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:55,530
through and indicate that the what we

740
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,870
defined was not a driver's license so

741
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:02,490
this would be things like phone texts

742
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:05,429
mobile and that were great if all I

743
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,710
cared about was driver's license but I'm

744
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:11,010
an insurance company I care about hip I

745
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:14,909
care about PC I care about GLBA and so

746
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:17,280
what we found out was the way that the

747
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:20,790
logic was is when an incident went to be

748
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,320
created if it had we would exempt it if

749
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:25,679
it had a not driver's license

750
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:30,480
classification meaning that if an actual

751
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,790
incident went through and had a PCI GLBA

752
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,150
plus a driver's license and not driver's

753
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,830
license classification in my mind Micah

754
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:40,440
says that that should have created an

755
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,270
incident however the rules that I set

756
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,800
forth would have exempted it so instead

757
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:49,830
what we did is we switched that to yes

758
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,800
and so our new drivers license goes

759
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,630
through and we're looking for a regular

760
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,760
regular expression dictionary plus a

761
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:59,340
custom dictionary that indicates a

762
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,590
positive driver's license match so we're

763
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:06,690
looking for like things like a license

764
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:09,360
and LIC number LIC then driver's license

765
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,100
drive vehicle things that we would

766
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,340
expect to be found around a driver's

767
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,740
license and this simple tweak went

768
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,570
through and took our drivers license

769
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,750
classification from being our second

770
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:25,140
most chatty to one of our most accurate

771
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:30,690
overnight so by doing small tweaks you

772
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:35,348
can have a huge wins so

773
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:37,300
I've really bashed traditional data

774
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:39,300
classifications what can we do to

775
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:43,630
augment those to make them better

776
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,089
simple we weaponize our users and what I

777
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,530
mean by that is we involve our users in

778
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:51,819
going through and doing data

779
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:54,849
classification for us many common office

780
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:57,790
type applications allow you to create

781
00:35:54,849 --> 00:36:00,700
custom meta tag data and allow your

782
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,589
users to simply apply those tags to the

783
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,098
metadata of your document and this is

784
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:09,430
wonderful on two fronts

785
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:12,819
front number one technically these tags

786
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:16,299
are in the headers of the document in a

787
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:18,819
place for anyone or any system that has

788
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:23,470
access to that information can quickly

789
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:27,550
read it and reading that information is

790
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:30,098
really fast it's really easy for a DLP

791
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,810
scan engine or any engine to read the

792
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:35,440
header information of a document and

793
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:37,900
it's very accurate secondly in an

794
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,730
unintended consequence is every time a

795
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,550
user is interacting and saving a

796
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,530
document we pop up a little work or

797
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,210
message if they had not classified it

798
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,069
and asked them excuse me what do you

799
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,890
mind telling us what classification you

800
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:53,529
think that this document is and then our

801
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,779
little pop-up it has the data

802
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,430
classifications as spelled out plus a

803
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,480
little description of what that means

804
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:03,279
and it's really simple for a user to

805
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,980
read the description and this to self

806
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,890
decide what level that is now that goes

807
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:13,150
through and has a we're using our users

808
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:15,520
B we're also asking our users to help

809
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,800
participate to take that little second

810
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,869
to ask themselves if this work to get

811
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,530
our to leave unauthorized what would the

812
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:26,380
worst impact be and that statistically

813
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,480
has gone through and improved our users

814
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,859
in becoming a better data stewards

815
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,380
there's a lot of really interesting

816
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:33,640
research on something that's involving

817
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,819
users and that type of data

818
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,680
classification and how that has sweeping

819
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:40,920
changes within an organization and how

820
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,470
they manage data and I can

821
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,440
you it's true anecdotally I now have

822
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,140
users coming up to me and saying hey

823
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,660
Mike we're looking to do this with our

824
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,549
data currently we go through and we send

825
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,649
it this way is there a better way that

826
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,810
we should be thinking about it so just

827
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,600
involving your users and having that

828
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:02,580
constant reminder that hey this data

829
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,860
it's really sensitive to our

830
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,170
organization this really as an insurance

831
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,970
company our data is our competitive

832
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,000
advantage it's how we build our

833
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:14,279
insurance policies it's how we build our

834
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,870
classification it really is important

835
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,100
and it's important to remind our users

836
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:22,109
that that is important so now we're

837
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,150
going to go through and we're going to

838
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,950
play a game so how many people have read

839
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,370
Frank Herbert's tune for me it's one of

840
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:31,080
my favorite sci-fi series the first four

841
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:36,299
books are great after that they get a

842
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:39,540
little bit weird so with that Paul

843
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:43,110
Atreides our emperor has asked us to

844
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:48,300
create a data classification for him and

845
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:52,800
our our in our Empire so we're going to

846
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,750
be up here based in Iraq Asst basically

847
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,480
the center of the universe after all the

848
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:59,820
spice must flow when it comes to chapter

849
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,860
house and Caledon we are allies

850
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,620
represented by the green arrows however

851
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,320
we are enemies with a corn and giddy

852
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,450
prime so the very first thing that we

853
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,170
need to do in order to create a DLP

854
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:16,169
policy is we have to have knowledge of

855
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:20,850
ourselves or as I like to say intimacy

856
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:22,440
in to me I see and TM so we're going to

857
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,720
go through and we're going to create a

858
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,430
data classification so in this case

859
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,520
we're going to have five different types

860
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:32,640
of data classification we have a one is

861
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,940
public free to be shared but or to and

862
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,940
from anyone a two is proprietary and

863
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,000
it's used or it's only to be used within

864
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:44,460
Iraq as government a three is diplomatic

865
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,380
mean that it can be shared with anyone

866
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,870
and everyone however we

867
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:52,020
have to protect the integrity we have to

868
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,980
apply a digital signature to it a4 is

869
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,200
internal

870
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,120
it cannot be transmitted to the Arrakis

871
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,480
government or outside the Arrakis

872
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,100
government an a5 is top secret so once

873
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,930
we have our data classification the very

874
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,299
first thing that we have to do is we go

875
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,850
back to our day art or data flow map and

876
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,340
we apply what the rules actually look

877
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:15,270
like this is a critical point anytime I

878
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:17,910
do in any type of DLP work is I go

879
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,710
through and I make a nice map that

880
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,720
visualizes it into the business so that

881
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,880
they can understand exactly what we are

882
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,240
doing exactly what we are trying to do

883
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,610
and this is something that has had a

884
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,680
great success so I highly highly highly

885
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:34,080
recommend that you go through and use

886
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,200
that from there I go through and for

887
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,580
each classification I break it down into

888
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,160
documentation like this this is what I

889
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:44,190
as an engineer or the analyst would use

890
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,870
to translate that pretty map into the

891
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:52,130
actual documentation that we would then

892
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:53,940
go through and put into our system so

893
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:58,050
how do we go through and how do we

894
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,910
bypass it how do we if we are a little

895
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:04,110
bit more offensive in mind how do we

896
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,700
detect them bypass the lp well let's all

897
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,400
put on our offense pants what is the

898
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,819
very first thing that you would do when

899
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:18,290
you go through and you get a shell on a

900
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:18,290
system what's the second thing you do

901
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,899
Who am I you want to see who you are you

902
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,569
want to see what you're running so all

903
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,560
of these DLP tools that us defenders us

904
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:33,360
blue hats her and white hats are running

905
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,310
they're all document it we can just draw

906
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,620
them dump a process list and we can see

907
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:39,720
are there any processes that would

908
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,839
indicate that we're under either a V or

909
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:46,020
DLP in fact we do this all the time for

910
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:49,050
antivirus and trust me there

911
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,580
bypasses for every DLP you can crash you

912
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,310
could hide it you can pause it you could

913
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:56,310
suspend it you could stomp all over it

914
00:41:53,310 --> 00:42:00,330
and if you aren't don't have adequate

915
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:04,110
logging on your processes how would you

916
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:06,120
even know so the second thing that we

917
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:08,340
need to acknowledge is we understand

918
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,220
that we can overcome the actual client

919
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:16,170
pretty easily but what about the stuff

920
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:21,180
on the network well unfortunately the

921
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:23,180
way I describe DLP is it is based on

922
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,759
regular expression and text dictionaries

923
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:30,680
even the most basic of encryption or

924
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,420
data obfuscation will go through and

925
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,240
convert something that should trigger a

926
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,280
DLP event into something that would not

927
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,459
this is where we're going through and

928
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:46,110
we're requiring to make sure that you

929
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,530
understand that as good as DLP claims to

930
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,930
be

931
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:54,270
it does have some weaknesses and

932
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:57,690
cryptography is one of those also we

933
00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:01,230
need to go so if cryptography is an

934
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:03,050
issue why don't we just MTM ourselves so

935
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,250
that we can see inside of any crypto

936
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:08,820
traveling between the network segment

937
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,940
there have been issues where I have been

938
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:15,330
responding to an event that happened and

939
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,840
it was found out that a company that did

940
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:22,130
introduce that type of man-in-the-middle

941
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:25,410
inspection had not configured that

942
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:27,810
optimally and as such put themselves in

943
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,460
a situation where they downgraded the

944
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:32,850
crypto Suites that were actually running

945
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:35,220
and that had a very bad event so just

946
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:37,860
keep in mind that there is a cost if you

947
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,620
do go through and you do insert yourself

948
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:42,510
in an man-in-the-middle type of

949
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,850
situation make sure that you're using

950
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:47,540
the correct crypto ciphers on both the

951
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,920
receiving and the sending side and

952
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:54,740
you have a control to check that

953
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:58,270
regularly and on top of that dlp can

954
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:02,180
provide a lot of really interesting

955
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:04,910
information and a lot of that is really

956
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,190
really sensitive so as an attacker if

957
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,080
you know that you're in a DLP enabled

958
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,490
environment I would want to go through

959
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,380
and I'd want to try to figure out where

960
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,029
that DLP information store is because

961
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,630
I'm going to get a lot of really

962
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,950
sensitive information that's going to go

963
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,840
through and tell me where other

964
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:24,020
potentially sensitive information is

965
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:32,510
with that that's the end of my

966
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:36,920
presentations any questions so that

967
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:41,090
depends on the actual environment or the

968
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:44,600
actual DLP tool is different tools place

969
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:47,750
it in different areas so in the DLP

970
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,930
tools that I use there is a little icon

971
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:53,330
in the lower right hand corner I can

972
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,430
simply right click on that icon and I

973
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:57,740
can click about and it will tell me

974
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:06,529
exactly where that DLP management

975
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:08,990
console is just like your a/v or any

976
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:14,470
other controls it usually says hey

977
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:14,470
here's my server any other questions

978
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:40,340
[Music]

979
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:44,870
all right let me let me chew that over

980
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,700
for a second in the case of how of that

981
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:50,960
it's going to depend on how each

982
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:53,450
individual solution is architected in

983
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,660
the case of the one that we use the

984
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:59,259
management console sits on a server

985
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:01,779
inside of our traditional environment

986
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,850
order to go through and upload an

987
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,190
incident or get updates the client must

988
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:10,600
be connected to that and there's a

989
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:13,240
default check-in of randomized every

990
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,680
hour so it could be at 20 minutes it

991
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,359
could be at 30 minutes it could be at 40

992
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,580
minutes it could be at 57 minutes but

993
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,060
within each hour it will check in at

994
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:24,759
least once all of the communications

995
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:31,410
from the management console to the end

996
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:35,380
client system are encrypted with TLS 1.2

997
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,839
however if I am a sufficiently advanced

998
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,970
adversary and I have root on the local

999
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,650
system and of course going to be able to

1000
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:51,279
see everything that's going on inside

1001
00:46:41,650 --> 00:47:07,930
once that hits the end client user any

1002
00:46:51,280 --> 00:47:10,870
other questions so usually the it

1003
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:13,750
depends on which DLP solution you're

1004
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:17,200
using in our case the network monitor

1005
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:20,800
can be physical or virtual the with

1006
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,839
respect to the actual clot or with

1007
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,540
respect to the virtual there is some

1008
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,840
concerns about making sure that your

1009
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:32,140
hypervisor can support turning those

1010
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,630
ports built into the hardware into

1011
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:37,000
promiscuous mode in terms of the DLP

1012
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,320
repository scanner that's just a piece

1013
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,040
of software that you can add to a

1014
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:46,780
physical or virtual and are or with our

1015
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:50,950
tool however I have seen some tools

1016
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:53,560
where this is its own standalone VM the

1017
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:58,779
email that's another piece of software

1018
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:00,340
that either you can install on a either

1019
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,070
physical or virtual server or they do

1020
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:05,890
have a virtual appliance that's running

1021
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:07,570
a hardened heart into Linux the same

1022
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,710
thing that I said for email is true with

1023
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:11,290
Web

1024
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:15,640
and the DLP management console that we

1025
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:18,670
use that is just a part or that's just

1026
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,759
an application that you can load onto a

1027
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:25,030
virtual machine or a physical server or

1028
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:52,600
you could choose the vendor's cloud

1029
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:54,880
version of that I'm sorry DLP is very

1030
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:59,290
good for what it's designed to do

1031
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:03,400
however we need to be very careful to go

1032
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:07,090
through and to explicitly help guide the

1033
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:09,250
business to understand what DLP can do

1034
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:13,120
and what it cannot do to our

1035
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:15,250
environments in my mind DLP is not meant

1036
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:36,549
to stop a sufficiently advanced

1037
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:52,330
adversary they can by attempt to bypass

1038
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:54,940
it yes the biggest weakness of DLP my

1039
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:56,850
opinion is the name data loss prevention

1040
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:01,330
because it sets an unrealistic

1041
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:05,560
expectation I'll throw this out there so

1042
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:09,520
within my organization after four years

1043
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:13,640
we have deployed three rules the first

1044
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:15,770
rule is for all client systems

1045
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,069
when somebody plugs in a piece of

1046
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:21,290
portable media we go through and we deny

1047
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:25,190
access to that portable media unless the

1048
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:27,290
user is a member of an active directory

1049
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:31,220
group that piece of portable media has

1050
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:34,580
had a trusted device type defined for it

1051
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:37,129
something like an A or like a low

1052
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:41,000
extension that you throw on to sling

1053
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:44,930
your presentation up to a projector or

1054
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,380
up to a TV or it is a trusted machine

1055
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:50,720
type such as a kiosk machine the second

1056
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:54,290
rule that we have is for any type of

1057
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,810
plug-and-play peripheral where we go

1058
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:58,880
through and we block access unless the

1059
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,700
unless one of those three exceptions is

1060
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,400
made and the third rule which is only

1061
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,859
applied to the Americas is the data

1062
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,080
protect portable media rule where if

1063
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,470
somebody does have access to portable

1064
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,790
media we go through and any file or data

1065
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:16,399
that they write to that piece of

1066
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:18,560
portable media we do a DLP scan against

1067
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,450
it and if there is a match against one

1068
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,790
of our classifications we created an

1069
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:26,000
incident on the back end but we allow

1070
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,950
that action to take place now keep in

1071
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,320
mind when it comes to that right we do

1072
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:33,109
have additional controls such as

1073
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,730
portable media encryption on top of DLP

1074
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:55,400
it's a separate control but I would

1075
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:57,530
argue complementary as well originally

1076
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,860
you set up the network and you're

1077
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:06,590
getting a lot of all positives as you

1078
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,590
this way no they weren't false positives

1079
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:18,060
and then you fine-tune your rule see

1080
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:22,799
right so initially did you have any kind

1081
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:26,160
of measurement performance since prior

1082
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:29,640
to your fine-tuning to after your

1083
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:32,940
network traffic load and wondered here

1084
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:37,950
now that you find tune in your network

1085
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:40,560
logo fight with a LP so I want to answer

1086
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:45,000
that in a couple different ways so in

1087
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:46,950
terms of the actual DLP network we have

1088
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,320
not done any monitoring basically what

1089
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:51,810
that will do kind of like a backup job

1090
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,730
it reaches out into the repository grabs

1091
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:57,049
a copy brings it over runs a skin and

1092
00:52:53,730 --> 00:53:01,080
then deletes the copy of it the DLP

1093
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:03,600
email that is done in our cloud

1094
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:06,600
environment so that is all within the

1095
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:09,270
email we don't have any metrics around

1096
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,710
that the DLP web we're working on

1097
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:13,220
turning that up now we haven't done

1098
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:18,570
anything around that with the DLP

1099
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:19,709
monitor what is critical to understand

1100
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,110
with that when we're reading it and

1101
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:26,100
currently off of the taps of the traffic

1102
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:30,660
that is seen there is the shadow copy of

1103
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:35,990
the data so no network impact on that so

1104
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:40,230
but where you're where you hit home is

1105
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:43,109
there is now a trend to blame DLP for

1106
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:45,120
any client performance issue so to go

1107
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:47,580
through and to do that we have an agent

1108
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,520
on a couple of our IT security machines

1109
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:53,400
that will go through and it'll sample as

1110
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,610
several times a second the CPU the

1111
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,930
memory of the network i/o the disk i/o

1112
00:53:55,610 --> 00:54:01,990
all of those good stats per

1113
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:05,259
process and we can go through and we can

1114
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:08,859
query that and we can take a look and

1115
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:11,200
say this is the true cost of DLP on that

1116
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:14,920
client system and that's gone through

1117
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,098
and been very very beneficial in going

1118
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:20,829
through and vindicating in many

1119
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:23,440
situations the actual true cost of the

1120
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:25,800
DLP client on those machines but keep in

1121
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,660
mind both in the number of

1122
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,180
classifications as well as the number of

1123
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,910
rules that I have active on my DLP

1124
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:35,259
clients it's very very small and that's

1125
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:38,259
by design because we're trying to

1126
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:41,619
offload as much of those more enterprise

1127
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:44,680
types tasks up higher in the stack to

1128
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:47,220
ensure that our clients can run at full

1129
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:55,598
speed so have you seen an increase in

1130
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:59,790
lying to the DLP II work as far as an

1131
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:08,770
increase in traffic none traffic flow

1132
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:12,520
but not really because the average

1133
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:16,720
client is only going through and

1134
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:19,869
creating three DLP incidents a day in

1135
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:22,000
the Americas and those are the data

1136
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:24,670
protect which are a little bit heavier

1137
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,470
because the device control incidents are

1138
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:28,480
just hey we blocked this device or hey

1139
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,308
we allowed this device whereas when

1140
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,809
we're talking about the data protect

1141
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:34,569
that's where we're actually going

1142
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:36,790
through and adding a copy of that

1143
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:43,480
evidence file of the file that triggered

1144
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:45,308
the event well being the initial 100 a

1145
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:49,000
day and that's that was because our

1146
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:51,430
rules were horrible and if I would say

1147
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,500
something on Tony it's really easy the

1148
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:56,529
first pass that he'd take a tuning to

1149
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:58,030
get the first 80% knocked off it's a

1150
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:00,549
little bit harder to do the next round

1151
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:01,470
and even harder to do the following one

1152
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:05,400
you have

1153
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:06,930
very creative and unfortunately one of

1154
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,869
the problems that we struggle with is

1155
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:12,839
that the actual who are using a

1156
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:14,520
different DLP scan engine in our email

1157
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,849
than we are for the rest of the network

1158
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:21,090
and the different classifications within

1159
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:24,000
the network or within the email versus

1160
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:26,580
the the rest of the environment means

1161
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,859
that when I have a DLP analyst looking

1162
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,090
at our email they're looking at

1163
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:31,770
different classification different

1164
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:34,440
regular expressions different text

1165
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:38,400
dictionaries different rules logic which

1166
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:41,750
is similar but not the same and I see

1167
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:45,750
that the fragmentation based on

1168
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:49,410
classifications is a very big risk I

1169
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:54,570
think if we could for some of the bigger

1170
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:57,420
MPI some of the HIPAA PCI GB glba

1171
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,970
have some sort of an open source

1172
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,859
definition so that all vendors could

1173
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:06,029
kind of agree to I think that'd be a

1174
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:08,580
huge win however the DLP manufacturers

1175
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:10,859
are incentivized to go through and to

1176
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:24,119
not allow that type of collaboration to

1177
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:25,799
go through and exist once life you know

1178
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,530
I thought about something this is not

1179
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,730
your DLP but it does reflect some of the

1180
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:32,280
things that you were saying there are no

1181
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:34,650
bad rules I mean there no positives only

1182
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,499
good one day

1183
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:39,720
as on their news articles reports about

1184
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:41,549
self-driving cars and one of the common

1185
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,680
issues that experience are better with

1186
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:46,160
the driving algorithms are found that

1187
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,149
human drivers don't stick to the rules

1188
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,799
environment and so what most

1189
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:53,130
self-driving cars have issues with

1190
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:54,960
people not sticking to the rules so I

1191
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,599
was thinking could we use this concept

1192
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,529
that you were talking about

1193
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,839
theoretically because none of us are

1194
00:57:58,529 --> 00:58:03,599
suffering car engineers could we use

1195
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:06,900
this theoretically to help these

1196
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:11,160
machines flow a little bit better in

1197
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:14,759
chaotic traffic so the way that I will

1198
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:16,920
answer this is I have started to be very

1199
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:20,940
obnoxious with that philosophy and

1200
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:25,829
inject that anytime the dreaded F P word

1201
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:27,630
is uttered in my presence there are no

1202
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:35,339
false positives only poorly written

1203
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:36,140
rules were around three o'clock in about

1204
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:39,538
five minutes

1205
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:45,299
type of one of my think I'm going 55 but

1206
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:47,279
Jerry's doing 70 you know I think that

1207
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:49,259
that's been the biggest problem of their

1208
00:58:47,279 --> 00:58:52,349
curing thing when people don't follow

1209
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:55,799
rules those things break out and so I'm

1210
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:58,140
saying and not not just people on the

1211
00:58:55,799 --> 00:59:01,950
road driving cars but also people that

1212
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:07,890
are not in cars up bikes motorcycles on

1213
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:10,379
pedestrians yeah so good that good that

1214
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:12,538
conceptual process be used in those

1215
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:17,640
algorithms to try to hold those cars

1216
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:24,650
think a little experiment I am NOT a

1217
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:24,650
data scientist fuzzy logic

1218
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,930
hey thank you thank you very much for

1219
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,930
this opportunity
