1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,039
so okay sorry I wanted to make sure we

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,110
got our videographer go on here all

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,750
right so our next presentation is by

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,480
Robby Stewart so it's a his discussion

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,279
of secrets so just a quick introduction

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,800
he's a social engineering practitioner

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,470
and there are many tricks that he uses

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,199
to gain access to facilities and ways

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,109
that he courses individuals into helping

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,490
achieve goals along the way he'll be

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,630
talking about some of these tricks

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,190
tactics and techniques to hopefully make

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,530
life harder and your security better

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,809
right so because if if he can get into

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,910
these places just by a walk and talk in

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,559
his way and that's not good so because

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,148
then you get physical access and as we

18
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,879
know if you have physical access you

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,329
have a lot more capabilities than if

20
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,699
you're trying to do it remotely so yes

21
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,649
you can do everything Darryl just did if

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,739
you have physical access which is you

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,620
know the best way to do it so so Robby's

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,480
consultants security consult for rapid7

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,580
working on engagements that range from

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,100
network and web application mobile

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,679
electronic social engineering physical

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,929
social engineering pen testing and he

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,900
breaks into things for a living so let's

30
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,900
talk about it right so let's give

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,619

nice weather all right so we're gonna

37
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,818
talk about some secrets some of them are

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,090
secrets and some not so much secrets

39
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,859
so this is my agenda I'm gonna say hi to

40

you guys and we're gonna talk about

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,579
social engineering talk a little more

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,870
about social engineering and kind of

43
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,260
finish up talking about social

44
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:27,890
engineering then all the credits on it

45
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,358
so hi I'm Robbie here I a stayer of my

46

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,500
of fun so I want to get an idea of who

51

doing it wrong so have any of you guys

58
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,349
ever heard about social engineering

59
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:13,000
before damn that was a resounding yes

60
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:14,500

yeah it's that one

67
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:33,400
so working for rapid7 doing social

68
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,319
engineering engagements I've been all

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,470
over the world now to break into

70
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,089
buildings and there are a ton of fun and

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,200
sometimes I'm successful and sometimes

72
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,489
I'm not

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,910
and this first story we're going to

74
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:49,989
start off with was a lot of fun it was

75
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:54,010
in New York and I was told by my pointed

76
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:56,440
contact that their building was one that

77
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,000
I was not going to get into so I

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,190
chuckled and said we'll see how all this

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,660
goes so I dressed in a very formal

80
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:11,500
attire it was for a bank so I wore a

81
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:16,108
suit vest and everything I was to the

82
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:20,019
tee looking super super super fancy I

83
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,789
went in towards the evening

84
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,099
esque timeframe where and say is

85
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,260
probably like 3 or 4 o'clock it's

86
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:28,150
getting towards the end of the day if I

87
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,280
get in I like to kind of hang arrow and

88
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,469
wait until people leave and then I could

89
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,799
do a lot of a lot more nefarious stuff

90
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:42,160
with nobody else around

91
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:44,200
so I've purchased the building and there

92
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,030
were two individuals that happen to be

93
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,729
standing outside and that were smoking

94
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,309
so of course I walk right up to him I

95
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:53,830
start smoking too and I try to go into

96
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,750
one door and it turns out that door that

97
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,539
doors never worked for getting into the

98
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,960
building so I was like ah crud

99
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,240
sucks but they're like oh no the doors

100
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,530
over that way that's like okay cool I'll

101
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,050
go that way and one of the guys started

102
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,630
to leave so I was in between these two

103
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:13,920
people so it was one person there was me

104
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:16,380
there's another person we go into the

105
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,680
building they have a very small foyer

106
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,750
with a bunch of elevators around and you

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,660
have to batch to walk past this security

108
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,670
guard I just followed right in suit and

109
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,170
just walked right behind them I did

110
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,230
imagine all I stayed in between

111
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,150
sandwiched in between these two people

112
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,690
that's right past security jump on an

113
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,620
elevator with one of the guys and

114
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,690
looking for the button that I need to

115
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,570
push to go to a certain floor and don't

116
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:46,680
see it so I'm in the wrong elevator okay

117
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,800
another crawling elevator so we have

118
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,120
passed by security again I'm just gonna

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,710
make it quick so I ride the elevator

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,810
with the guy and we can kind of shoot

121
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,510
the a little and I get to the

122
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,280
bottom floor jump out of elevator and

123
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,500
just like - over to one of the other

124
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,780
elevators and write it up to the floor

125
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,600
that I need to go to security didn't

126
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,309
stop me had no issue with me being there

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,850
so I get off on the customers floor and

128
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,410
they have a couple of them talking to

129
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,810
the point of contact I already knew kind

130
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,650
of some of the layout of who was on what

131
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,360
floors and some floors to avoid so I

132
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,150
went right into the floor with my point

133
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,590
of contact and just met with him because

134
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,370
it was towards the end of the day for

135
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,989
him I wanted to show him hey I'm here I

136
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,630
made it in we're gonna go ahead and

137
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,820
continue to do stuff but I made it and

138
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,080
he was kind of surprised so we talked

139
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,790
about a little bit of the floor layout

140
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,180
and where he really wanted me to try to

141
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,280
get into and then I just spent the rest

142
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,170
of my day trying to get into the rest of

143
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,469
the building so the the inside of their

144
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,260
layout they have badge access for every

145
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,750
single door there's some small always

146
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,240
off the elevators a little bit of a

147
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,380
lobby area in some of the floors

148
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,690
rest of that you have to have badge

149
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,620
access to get behind any and every

150
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:07,319
single door except for their little

151
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,360
cantinas that they have so I could go

152
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,270
into the cantina and stand around

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,639
looking like I'm eating a lunch or just

154
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,889
kind of hang out for a second and then

155
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,259
just tailgate literally through every

156
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,560
single door inside of their office space

157
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:25,800
if I couldn't find someone to tailgate

158
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,919
into an office space with then I would

159
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,380
walk up to a door and knock on it and

160
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,770
wait for someone to come get me it was

161
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,780
pretty bad I got into every single space

162
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,969
that they had one of the other things

163
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,580
that I noticed and this is kind of where

164
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:45,330
some of the secrets come in probably not

165
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,000
so much to a lot of you people but they

166
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,539
had motion sensors for motion to exit

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,159
sensors for a lot of the doors as well

168
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,139
usually you can kind of can them if you

169
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,090
don't know what canning is you can of

170
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,490
compress there and flip it upside down

171
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,560
spray it towards the sensor it'll trip

172
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,900
the sensor and you can open that door so

173
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,389
I needed a can of air I didn't have a

174
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:11,580
can of air but you know who usually has

175
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:13,620
a can of air IT IT was the one thing

176
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,030
that he wanted me to try my hardest to

177
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,219
get into he said IT is the spot like you

178
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,530
cannot get into IT it's gonna be the

179
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:25,800
hardest thing that you will ever do so I

180
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,289
get into IT and I walk around for a

181
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,639
minute and I'm asking them walking

182
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,098
around people are like Wyatt what are

183
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,079
you doing what I'm just having problems

184
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,360
with my keyboard and I need a can of air

185
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,828
do you guys have an advocate Aaron's

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,979
like oh yeah we got a can air here you

187
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,978
go

188
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,880
fell for it alright thanks for the kid

189
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,640
air and then I left and I walked around

190
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,680
some of the doors trying to can them

191
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,060
their sensors were definitely offset so

192
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,620
it was a little harder to point the k2

193
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,140
hair towards the sensor and I couldn't

194
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:01,399
rip any of them actually the ones that I

195
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,290
tried I also tried so nobody was

196
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,570
stopping me like there's definitely

197
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,099
people wandering around people saw me I

198
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:13,010
noticed that they also had a site from

199
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,300
just motion to exit sensors they had the

200
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,240
big red button on the side of the door

201
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,250
do you can push if if the sensor went

202
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,839
off it was their emergency exit if

203
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,790
powers lost the building kind of thing

204
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,000
or something like that but there was a

205
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,250
gap in the side of the door so I started

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,290
thinking about it and found a coat

207
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,269
hanger and just bent the coat hanger

208
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,279
around and I was reaching through this

209
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,320
gap in the door trying to get leverage

210
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,140
to push a button to see if I could trip

211
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,970
the door and this lady come out while I

212
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,140
was doing that and she looked at me like

213
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,449
I was weird and I was like ah I'm just

214
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:51,410
checking all of the doors seeing what I

215
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:57,380
can and can't do with him I'm not lying

216
00:09:51,410 --> 00:10:00,740
and she left me she didn't force me out

217
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,050
or anything but she left me and some

218
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,920
time had passed and with all that time

219
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,209
passing I ended up wanting just about to

220
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,829
leave but I wanted to check in with one

221
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,449
point of contact first to see if he was

222
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:13,640
still around to let him know hey I got

223
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:16,779
into everything that you guys have I

224
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,699
found all kinds of stuff that's wrong

225
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,230
and he had left for the day so I'm

226
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:23,269
standing in the lobby area on his floor

227
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,920
and these two guys jump off the elevator

228
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,790
and it turns out one of them's like the

229
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,949
VP of IT type of thing and he he

230
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:36,050
confronts me like haha we caught you I

231
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:38,630
was like well I was leaving so I stopped

232
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,609
you wouldn't have caught me but well we

233
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,970
went then then we did the exchange that

234
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,320
you do and we uh we were leaving they

235
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,870
took me down to the bottom floor to

236
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,670
escort me out of the building

237
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,170
and while we're doing that the lady that

238
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,890
had found me she was standing with

239
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,240
security is like that's the guy turns

240
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,550
out she thought I was super suspicious

241
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,010
so she emptied her floor like she told

242
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,349
everybody to leave which was a good

243
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,000
thing in a way I could have been a

244
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,820
really bad guy

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,120
so she heightened security or at least

246
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,830
alerted security there's a dude on this

247
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,380
floor who's doing some really weird

248
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,180
stuff and I mean they didn't really

249
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,660
catch me until I was leaving and then we

250
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,479
did the whole exchange again

251
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,040
so let's disseminate this what went

252
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,220
right what went wrong what could they

253
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,319
have done better so I'm gonna kind of

254
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,670
open it up a little this is my story

255
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,160
what do you guys think from what I've

256
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:45,430
told you about this story that they

257
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:56,250
could have done that one I am going to

258
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:56,250
say I can't answer I'm not aware of

259
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:03,820
sothanks thing physical security for a

260
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:05,710
second no I didn't know badges I had no

261
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:11,380
badges on you know fake badges no real

262
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:19,350
badges it wasn't out of scope it's just

263
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:19,350
not how I rolled yes they had badges

264
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,069
trying to recall and that I'm not

265
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:31,170
entirely positive I don't think every

266
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,170
single person had a display of a badge

267
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,459
no they were not alright so this is the

268
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,770
way that I see it first things first

269
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,760
I tailgated past security security get

270
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,960
some inaudible bleep when you imagine

271
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,700
mine didn't make that noise if I just

272
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,250
follow to worsen security should've

273
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,200
stopped me issue to the elevators

274
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,390
elevators didn't have badge access

275
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,880
control I can jump on any elevator and

276
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,399
go to any floor that I wanted to that's

277
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,439
a bit of a problem

278
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,889
now the people in their culture they

279
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:07,839
were very welcoming because of my attire

280
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:10,029
I looked like I was important even

281
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,319
though people had never met me before so

282
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,240
if I knocked on the door and said I need

283
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:14,829
in this room they would let me in the

284
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,639
room without confronting me for

285
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:21,370
questioning me that was an issue people

286
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,319
I did interact with again didn't

287
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,509
confront me didn't question me didn't

288
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:27,910
say I don't know who you are I need to

289
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:30,310
kind of validate who you are and then we

290
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,560
can move on so that's kind of the super

291
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,719
nuts of it things that dig oh right is

292
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,079
the lady that did catch me doing

293
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,629
something bad she did report it in the

294
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,550
end she did report it that is good I

295
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:43,899
think she should have done a little more

296
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,819
in my personal opinion but she was a

297
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:58,860
small little lady and I can understand

298
00:13:45,819 --> 00:14:00,819
her intense it's not I mean it could be

299
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,160
so these are the things that I pointed

300
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,959
out to all these other ways that that

301
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:15,790
you know you might want to think about

302
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:16,660
enhancing some of this stuff okay no not

303
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,750
that I'm aware of

304
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,290
I meant to point out when I jumped to

305
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:28,809
this as well like intro the stock rapid7

306
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:32,230
slide it's a couple of those so our next

307
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:34,569
story and just heads up a girl it won't

308
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,170
take a whole hour hopefully not my

309
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:41,319
stories are kind of short so this one is

310
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:46,689
one of my favorite engagements and this

311
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:48,759
was actually really short so office

312
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:52,750
building somewhere in the country an

313
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:55,540
undisclosed location perform all of my

314
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,829
typical ascent ahead of time if you're

315
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,899
not aware I was an open source

316
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,399
intelligence gathering it's finding

317
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:04,600
anything and everything you can before

318
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,459
hint or during or whenever you want but

319
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,910
I look up through the building look at

320
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:09,069
the

321
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,510
the company I look up the people I look

322
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,570
up their culture I try to get as much

323
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:16,510
information about it as I can draft up

324
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:20,770
fake looking badges so hey this is a

325
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:22,420
badge that looks like it's legit this

326
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,150
was one of those engagements where

327
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:29,740
things kind of just did not go my way a

328
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:31,810
bit of the entire time it's a short

329
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,090
engagement it's just a few days things

330
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,739
either two or three days and one of

331
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,650
those days is usually allocated for

332
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,490
report writing so chalk it up to one or

333
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:46,390
two days worth of actual work I go on

334
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:49,240
site I'm driving from my hotel to their

335
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:54,640
office space dressed in appropriate

336
00:15:49,240 --> 00:16:00,100
attire and so on so forth I get a flat

337
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,810
tire on my way there so I was hoping to

338
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,950
get there in the morning I wanted to

339
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,750
arrive bright and early

340
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,760
walk in with everybody else and just do

341
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,030
a bunch of tailgating and see where I

342
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,790
could get into this building so that was

343
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,500
land that play in this foiled not gonna

344
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,660
get there at in the morning bright and

345
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,180
early like I wanted to instead it's been

346
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,390
an hour and a half changing a tire on

347
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,729
the side of the road with whatever

348
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:30,310
little tire iron cabe with the car that

349
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:33,730
I rented so I finally get to the office

350
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:37,030
space a little after noon so hoping to

351
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:40,270
catch a lunch crowd coming back and

352
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:42,579
there's no lunch crowd the building that

353
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,410
the company is working out of it's two

354
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,860
stories they own the second story

355
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,959
anybody going upstairs works for company

356
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,150
that's pretty easy yeah I walk into the

357
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,800
building there's an elevator that goes

358
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,280
up and there's a lady standing in front

359
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,349
of that elevator cool most of all this

360
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,680
lady's made me badges these elevators

361
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,390
she'll take care of me I stand next to

362
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,970
her waiting for the two seconds for

363
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,799
elevator come down there

364
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,019
how's your day going she kind of looks

365
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:13,009
me up and down goes no and walks over

366
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:17,699
and takes the stairs that's a little odd

367
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:20,819
okay I don't think I smell that bad so

368
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,769
jump on the elevator and write it up get

369
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:27,089
off the elevator and their office space

370
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:28,759
is tiny little tiny little area outside

371
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,710
of the elevator where the stairs come up

372
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:33,450
very small there's a hallway that leads

373
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:39,509
one way a hallway that leads another way

374
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:42,720
again all doors require badges and when

375
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:44,399
I get off the elevator I wanted to make

376
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720

377
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:48,570
of hang out for a minute and gain my

378
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,100
composure when I go to go into the

379
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,789
restroom I see the lady down the hallway

380
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,840
standing in front of another doorway

381
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:58,259

391
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,429

392
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,950
attention to me when he's done washing

393
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:25,049
his hands he steps back away from the

394
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,899
sink and just stands there and waits for

395
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,470
me to leave first so these people are on

396
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,110
point

397
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,950
they are watching out for anyone who

398
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:38,070
they do not recognize smaller company

399
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:41,759
everybody seems to know everybody okay

400
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,860
so I'm hanging out in front of one of

401
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:48,330
the doors right beside it playing on my

402
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:50,789
phone checking my emails happen happen

403
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,840
to catch a door as it was starting to

404
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:56,820
shut up because the lady the one lady

405
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,360

406
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:03,899
her unlike everybody else who made sure

407
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,539
that it shot behind them I go into the

408
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:09,418
office space I walk around for about

409
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,750
five seconds is the video that I have of

410
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,820

411
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,390

412
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:22,189

435
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,870

debrief call afterwards and I come to

440
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,820
find out that what this organization in

441
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,950
this location had gone through before I

442
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,980
got there they went through some active

443
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,690
shooter training and they were all very

444
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,630
aware of the possibility of someone

445
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,930
coming in and how to handle someone

446
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:54,890
coming in I forgot I did get back from

447
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:57,080
to the back space one time after talked

448
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,670
to my point of contact there there was a

449
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,110
gentleman a couple ladies that happen to

450
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,940
go through a door and I followed them in

451
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,090
two steps into the door the gentleman

452
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,770
stops me we're gonna go talk out in this

453
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,480
office space and he looks like he's

454
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,770
ready to punch me in the face so I let

455
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,200
him know right off the bat like hey man

456
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,820
you're supposed to be doing the stuff

457
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,350
good LG a free credit don't push me in

458
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,639
the face

459
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,929
so yeah I found out that they went

460
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,970
through active shooter training so these

461
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,320
people were not gonna let something

462
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,210
happen to the rest of the people that

463
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,370
work there or at least let everybody

464
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,140
know if someone suspicious is standing

465
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,770
around in their building that they did

466
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,330
not recognize so this was a little

467
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,870
harder to tear apart what went right or

468
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:39,120
wrong especially which standpoint you

469
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,320
look at it from so what were right

470
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,659
nobody engaged me

471
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,090
not a single person would really

472
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,220
interact with me except for the lady who

473
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:51,330
wanted to like validate who I was and

474
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:54,360
why I was there so everything else just

475
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:57,780
went wrong for me they did everything

476
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,330
right I did everything okay I guess they

477
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:04,560
were just on point

478
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:15,720
so that's Story number two what do you

479
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:18,679
mean non disclose the location I'm gonna

480
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,320
keep secret two active engagements

481
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,550
non-disclosure and whatnot

482
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:31,350

491
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,020
was like I want to make sure my aperture

492
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:07,280
is right it's going on the instagrams so

493
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:11,650
the story number three is oh this is

494
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:16,520
this is a recent one actually and why I

495
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:18,860
feel that having multiple practitioners

496
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,540
on a social engineering engagement is

497
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,340
very beneficial to us because we all

498
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,500
play off of each other and when you get

499
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,449
a group of people together who just work

500
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:34,520
really well together doing very evil

501
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:37,660
things good things happen for them so

502
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,340
this one I have to give a shout out to

503
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,650
Shane and Leon because they worked on me

504
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,139
work with me on this one and if it

505
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:52,640
wasn't for them we would not have shieff

506
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:55,520
what we did so this is a story about two

507
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:03,170
office locations and some branch offices

508
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:05,900
for a company we happen to do an

509
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,490
internal assessment for them that

510
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,800
weekend prior so we had some insider

511
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,360
information as well which was very

512
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,790
beneficial to us because during that

513
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,820
assessment one of the things that was

514
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:24,389
discovered was a file that contained

515
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:29,159
everybody's badge codes yeah

516
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:33,690
we can be anybody so we start off the

517
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:36,840
engagements we went to so they had two

518
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,549
two offices - two big offices what was

519
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:43,649
HQ the other one not so much HQ

520
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:49,470
so we started with that one we started

521
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:53,150
started there and going into the

522
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:56,460
building we had badges that worked for

523
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,080
every single one of the locations except

524
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,950
for me it turns out the badge that I had

525
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,850
worked for zero locations awesome and we

526
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:08,070
went in individually - so I was kind of

527
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,299
so well I walked up to the door turned

528
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,950
my badge it didn't work it's like aw

529
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:13,200
crap step to the side start playing on

530
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,419
my phone guy walks in I tailgate behind

531
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,429
them follow him into a Cantina and sit

532
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,900
down and message to guys like we're you

533
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,850
guys that if we need to get this thing

534
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,140
going

535
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:27,928
well inside of that building we had

536
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,429
access to everything they they didn't

537
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:31,080
really require bad to access once inside

538
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:34,590
the buildings there wasn't really any

539
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,449
spaces that were off-limits to us except

540
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:41,250
for a few areas but the badges we had

541
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:45,030
got us into those spaces while inside of

542
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:48,110
the office we dropped devices onto the

543
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,910
network do some network hacking we found

544
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,820
they had small little conference rooms

545
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,530
that offered training we were able to do

546
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,909
bad things to the straining computers

547
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:03,750
and steal passwords and my favorite part

548
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:09,600
was their data center because their data

549
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:15,860
center door was pretty weak common

550
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:18,689
interior door opened inward so the latch

551
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:23,760
smashes the gap between the door and the

552
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:26,610
jamb was a pretty decent size so using a

553
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,260
big piece of flexible really strong

554
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,790
plastic we were able to shim the door

555
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,770
open and get into their data center

556
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:38,980
and have physical access to all of their

557
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:41,210
servers which is server room selfie dive

558
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,980
you guys have ever heard any of my other

559
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,560
stories the one about the power plant in

560
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:51,710
southeast that was that whole point oh

561
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:55,129
no go back so inside of this building we

562
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:57,740
rummage for a few hours and on the way

563
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,470
out passing a guy we see he's wearing a

564
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,350
shirt that is branded with the stores

565
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,150
that we're going to so we ask him hey

566
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,350
where did you get that shirt it's like

567
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,810
all there in the basement but it

568
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:12,740
requires some special access to get down

569
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:18,620
there we got special access so now we

570
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:21,410
have shirts and found some stuff in the

571
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:26,629
basement too there's some skeletons down

572
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:30,200
there and the next day we start off

573
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:34,700
fresh we went to one of the branch

574
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,830
locations and and Shane and I dressed in

575
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,690
their fancy new shirts just walk right

576
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,370
in until they hate we're from corporate

577
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,730
we got some stuff to do in the back

578
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:50,030
we're gonna go do some stuff in the back

579
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:51,770
and she didn't stop us like oh okay you

580
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,350
know we go into the back and make sure

581
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,850
their network is doing network stuff and

582
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:59,870
what network stuff we can do on their

583
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:02,240
network and we can do network stuff in

584
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:06,590
that back room they also had boxes that

585
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,920
were documentation for things that had

586
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,419
really important identifiable things on

587
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,820
them so we stole those boxes well at

588
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,370
least stole one of those boxes walked it

589
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,620
out to the truck and make sure we got a

590
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:23,120
lot of photos of the internals of that

591
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,679
box and the paperwork inside of it and

592
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,330
then promptly returned the box because

593
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,890
we didn't really want to take this stuff

594
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,389
and found out that the lady had salt

595
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,900
salts going out and she was a little

596
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,670
curious

597
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,810
she saw me stumble at one point just

598
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,860
like I didn't know you guys are doing

599
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,030
but I didn't see you take the box

600
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:43,659
so we let her know what had happened

601
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:47,649
what it was and talked her through the

602
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:53,080
process of what we do and then finally

603
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:58,080
we went to the headquarters and getting

604
00:28:53,080 --> 00:29:02,620
into the headquarters was easy we just

605
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,990
tailgated some more really jimmied open

606
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,639
some doors that didn't shut all over the

607
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:12,760
way and again had access to everything

608
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,980
nobody stopped us my first stop was to

609
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,410
Mike one a contacts office who was not

610
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:22,240
there so I left in my business card just

611
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:24,460
let him know I'd been there and after

612
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,770
getting into every door I mean at that

613
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,350
point we've reached a point of we've

614
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:32,020
gotten so much we've done so many bad

615
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,418
things already well we're in the other

616
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,010
facility of the other office building we

617
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,610
also took devices out of their data

618
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:44,700
center and got pictures just to show the

619
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:47,918
point of contact we had devices and

620
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:51,400
we've done so much it's now let's be

621
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,500
brazen time so with people in hallways

622
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,500
we're walking up to doors that are shut

623
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:00,340
and locked and trying to Jimmy them open

624
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:03,100
using shifts and knives and big pieces

625
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,389
of plastic stuck into a door jambs like

626
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:10,449
oh hey what's up try to get the doors

627
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:12,070
stuck one of their policies as well we

628
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,230
like to push on some of these when we

629
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,030
find them out they had a policy that

630
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,910
when you enter in to their their main

631
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,799
area you have to badge in before you

632
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,500
walk through the door that's just a

633
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,720
policy thing anybody can hold the door

634
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,640
for you which we tried like I kept

635
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,690
pushing that that limit like every time

636
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,040
I was near that door and there was

637
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,320
someone on the other side oh hey let me

638
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,990
get that for you see who's gonna just

639
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,460
walk in or I would walk up to the door

640
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,700
and see if someone else would just let

641
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,220
me in we become very brazen at this

642
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,710
point like somebody kicked me out of the

643
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:48,289
building

644
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:49,520
please and then finally we get in touch

645
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:51,730
with our point of contact we have a

646
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,110
little debrief from and we come to learn

647
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:57,950
because we were gonna do some other of

648
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,240
their little office locations we were

649
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,520
gonna go just some more room but we came

650
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,830
to learn that the lady that we

651
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,899
interacted in that little little space

652
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,490
she actually sent an email like hey

653
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:08,449
didn't know corporate was coming into

654
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,399
town today

655
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,630
it's kind of weird these two guys and

656
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,279
they're like oh that's not us you should

657
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,340
kick them out but we were long gone by

658
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,590
then so then they pull load our faces to

659
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:22,039
every one of other branch locations like

660
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:25,820
don't interact with these two dudes so

661
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:29,120
that that going for us we apparently

662
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:33,678
really made the physical security chief

663
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:44,239
guy very upset about that but yeah so

664
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:45,740
let's talk about that one no actually I

665
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,529
usually stand in front of that door and

666
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,779
see if I can break away into it like I

667
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:54,230
will I let people walk past me while I'm

668
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:57,950
on my knees with a gym trying to pick

669
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,620
open a door or something I've done that

670
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,299
other engagements and that people come

671
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,668
up to me hey do you need help with

672
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:07,220
something I just told them like

673
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:08,990
literally with lockpicks in a door in an

674
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,460
open space with a lot of people around

675
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,770
just look oh no I'm just checking the

676
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:16,130
locks oh I got it

677
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,860
Thanks so yeah I become very bright

678
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,630
brazen at times I guess now it's the

679
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,149
time that you need to be kicking me out

680
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,880
a hundred percent if it wasn't when I

681
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:28,309
first walked in the door it's now when

682
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,250
I'm like what walking around with like

683
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:33,230
boxes of stuff like you've never seen me

684
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,880
before but I have a box full of things

685
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:39,230
that I'm believing with so you need to

686
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,470
be stopping me this is bad so yeah that

687
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,419
engagement not a lot picking but the

688
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,220
office bases what

689
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,600
right what went wrong what could they

690
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,859
have done better as a little heart so

691
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:59,719
there's three locations that we talked

692
00:32:51,859 --> 00:33:01,668
about yeah yeah there there's a fair

693
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,109
number of people who would say no I got

694
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,700
a badge but there was definitely the

695
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:21,470
handful of people that just about cool

696
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:23,960
lakes or come on in yeah any door that

697
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,639
we came across that we couldn't badge in

698
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,039
to because there was like a tier higher

699
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:30,979
than what we could but only one tier

700
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:36,049
higher we could basically shipment open

701
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:40,239
either shim it or using a shove a tool

702
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:40,239
just pick the pizza door open with that

703
00:33:51,609 --> 00:34:05,269
that's a big control yeah how was it

704
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:06,769
definitely a thing so one of the the

705
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:08,179
first building we went into we were also

706
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:13,250
in their training room their training

707
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:15,770
room we we could they didn't do any disk

708
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:19,119
level encryption so we pulled hashes and

709
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:24,710
had domain admin grants off of those

710
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:29,480
which is pretty bad just users are off

711
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:31,639
yeah his domain off so they had that

712
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,219
capability the device is actually we're

713
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,889
only using a local account but they had

714
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:42,189
they were on the domain and happened to

715
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,190
have ad a memory so there's that

716
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:57,130
I talked from a point of contact on that

717
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:59,350
one with the Sioux in in New York he

718
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:03,880
said it was a bit of a fear of authority

719
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:07,150
because only the top c-level people or

720
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,020
dressed that high-end everybody else was

721
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:30,520
just a button up and tucked in so it was

722
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:33,370
a bit of a fear of authority one small

723
00:35:30,520 --> 00:36:43,560
one large I I don't know like where they

724
00:35:33,370 --> 00:36:43,560
fall in that like for me

725
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:00,920
maybe it depends on where you're talking

726
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:06,460
about there are some facilities that I

727
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,460
went into there

728
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:08,630
I assume I assume that's why she was so

729
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:11,150
the question was is the second talk that

730
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,130
I was talking about lady came out to the

731
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,570
four-year area and confronted me she's

732
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,240
the only person I really talked to in

733
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:20,060
the building and she I told her that I

734
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,919
was there to see someone and then she

735
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:27,170
left and then she came back again so I

736
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,450
assumed that in between those two

737
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,710
interactions with her she was confirming

738
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:48,730
if I was supposed to be meeting somebody

739
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:48,730
or not companies wish you

740
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,890
oh yeah yeah companies engage with us

741
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,120
every ass rapid7 or our service they

742
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:03,870
engage with us hey this is the

743
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:06,029
engagement we want to do so potentially

744
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,490
sometimes people engage with us to do

745
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:11,570
these engagements to just get a baseline

746
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:14,009
first off and see where they're at

747
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:17,280
sometimes they've there are a lot more

748
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:20,610
mature and they understand how to

749
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,010
mitigate some of these tactics that we

750
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:25,200
deployed and they want to assure

751
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,980
themselves that their training and

752
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,919
everything else that they're

753
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,230
implementing is effective and it's

754
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,210
actually being just disseminated across

755
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,710
their organization so they just want to

756
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:43,550
make sure that everything they've done

757
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:46,940
is actually working so yeah it happens

758
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,940
that way sometimes

759
00:39:47,060 --> 00:40:18,840
anybody else guys nobody else that

760
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:20,940
nobody else had seen us together I'm not

761
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,560
sure and I don't know specifically like

762
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,590
what the time frame was since they had

763
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,560
had their active shooter training but I

764
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:30,120
do know that they told us they had just

765
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,590
recently gone through it they didn't

766
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,589
give us like a timeframe port though

767
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:45,839
but it's absolutely worthless issue

768
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:48,300
along with I would agree entirely with

769
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,280
that one of the things that I started

770
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,890
telling people was this is this training

771
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,050
like doing some kind of active shooter

772
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:58,350
training actually seemed to make them

773
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:59,850
more aware of the situation because they

774
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,460
weren't just concerned about Oh

775
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:05,100
someone's gonna steal my login when it's

776
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,280
more focused on the company it seems

777
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,049
people don't take it as personal but

778
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,610
when you tell someone hey we're gonna

779
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,290
give you training to protect your life

780
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,180
because someone might come in here and

781
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:22,880
try to take it from you they take it a

782
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:27,140
lot more serious it was a much smaller

783
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:32,940
much more difficult yeah I did a power

784
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:34,500
organization sometime last year maybe

785
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,880
towards the end of the year before that

786
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,200
it was a very small power company and

787
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,300
they were out in the middle of nowhere

788
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,759
they had one office building and one

789
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,620
kind of remote office building and I

790
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,290
couldn't get into anything because

791
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,750
there's probably 50 people in the

792
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,700
company everybody knew everybody if I

793
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:57,750
showed up in one place and said hey I'm

794
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,720
new and working for these people they're

795
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,880
like you don't work for us cuz we're

796
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,200
that small like we do our daily meetings

797
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,710
at one place and then come back over

798
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,620
here

799
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:12,860
this is really small company small

800
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:16,680
companies are more difficult they're not

801
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,850
undoable or not not doable they're

802
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,890
definitely more difficult when you're

803
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:22,529
talking about really going after hard on

804
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,940
the social aspects sometimes you can get

805
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,650
lucky and sneak in a door and hide in a

806
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,480
bathroom for six hours and then

807
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,660
everybody leaves and you have full

808
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,550
access to a building that's doable to I

809
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,240
mean change your shoes halfway through

810
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,240
and your be alright

811
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:56,559
sometimes I feel I've been in plenty of

812
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,319
buildings that have nothing like that

813
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:04,670
I've been in some buildings that have a

814
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:25,219
door alarm for the local PD and you just

815
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:27,140
wait until morning to sneak out it's a

816
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:29,869
six of one half a dozen of the other

817
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,779
kind of answer some I've have done

818
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:35,150
engagements for some companies that do

819
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:36,799
tell their employee base hey we're going

820
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:40,309
to be doing this kind of trade or this

821
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:43,130
kind of assessment be aware of it and I

822
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:44,809
like to encourage my customers to not do

823
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,269
anything like that because you're not

824
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:49,219
getting a real answer you're just

825
00:43:47,269 --> 00:44:01,910
getting a check box if we did this and

826
00:43:49,219 --> 00:44:04,670
nobody and we caught him doing it the

827
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:07,479
click-through rate still very consistent

828
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:12,130
you know people know it's kind of thing

829
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:12,129
do it anyway so that's unfortunate

830
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:31,430
that's a bit of a thing we can talk

831
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,199
afterwards about like what they're

832
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:39,078
really doing for training on on that

833
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:41,600
stuff but with with phishing emails we

834
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:45,050
can make them look very super real and

835
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:47,060
do so right now of course we have many

836
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:52,160
months it really didn't look that real

837
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:54,080
and you know that's kind of sad but

838
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,000
there was a thing I was gonna say and I

839
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:04,490
don't remember what it was now that

840
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:27,590
train is gone they use badges I didn't

841
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:29,479
try to clone it probably it would have

842
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:34,130
made it is slightly more difficult for

843
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:36,010
us we still would have gained access we

844
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,630
proven by the fact that I could tailgate

845
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:40,850
the likelihood of that happening is

846
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,650
seems to be pretty high

847
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:44,839
they were low-frequency badges and we

848
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:47,630
could just clone them bumping into

849
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:51,920
people if we wanted to do go that route

850
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:54,380
as well once we're inside the likelihood

851
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,910
of us finding the document that had all

852
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:10,490
of the badges in it was still pretty

853
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:11,839
high so I don't know we don't get into

854
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:15,290
those weeds they say here's a building

855
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,349
go break into it I say hi Kevin or I'm

856
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,420
already in

857
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:23,390
no I got another short story if you guys

858
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,789
want to hear another one's I think well

859
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:29,420
we got about five minutes Sam all right

860
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:31,430
I can do five minutes this one I thought

861
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,690
about talking about this one and then

862
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,520
held off on it because I don't like to

863
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:37,010
give away too many secrets on things

864
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,220
my favorite bit of these kind of

865
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:44,150
engagements is when we are able to do

866
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:46,640
them kind of back-to-back not quite full

867
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,380
red team have access to anything but we

868
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,819
kind of do one engagement than the other

869
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:55,309
has stack them and mainly when I can do

870
00:46:52,819 --> 00:46:56,930
a fish before physical because if I can

871
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:58,849
do a fish before physical then my

872
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,828
chances of the physical going right are

873
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:05,450
much higher because I can place myself

874
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:07,279
inside of areas so I was doing a

875
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,490
physical for someone outside of the

876
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:12,170
country and they they had roots here

877
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,879
this happen to have something over there

878
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,109
and I was doing a thing over there and

879
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,200
they wanted me to get into their data

880
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:19,788
center as well as a small office I might

881
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,960
have told a lot of you people this story

882
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:26,420
already so if just gears for a second so

883
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,490
fishing engagement kicks off I thought

884
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,599
long and hard all of about two minutes

885
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,899
of how I was going to go about doing

886
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,630
this whole org and decided I'm going to

887
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,690
cause as much havoc with a phishing

888
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,849
email as I can so I can show up on site

889
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:44,180
and say hi I'm with rapid7

890
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:46,069
Incident Response I need access to

891
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,950
everything to fix what happened last

892
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:53,089
week that's not like a great idea to me

893
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:55,160
I got the branding I got everything I

894
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:57,890
got the business cards already like this

895
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:01,129
is gonna play out nicely but it turned

896
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:03,589
out one of the VPS of some portion of an

897
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:06,319
organization for them was in my fishing

898
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:11,170
targets and he got very upset about what

899
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:11,170
I did because I did a lot of bad stuff

900
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:17,720
I've made a lot of noise I mean a lot of

901
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,160
noise and he wasn't too happy about it

902
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,930
and that kind of put a damper on the

903
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,690
physical stuff because I was on site and

904
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:26,029
they kind of started like restricting

905
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,730
when and what I could do

906
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:30,650
datacenter was now off the table and it

907
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:32,420
came down to like the 11th hour for the

908
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,790
physical they're like all right you can

909
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:38,900
go on-site you can't do like here's some

910
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:42,440
handcuffs and good luck like cool I got

911
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:46,819
like five hours before my flight leaves

912
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:48,589
to go back to the states I'm gonna go

913
00:48:46,819 --> 00:48:51,440
buy some baguettes and I went to buy a

914
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:54,799
bunch of pastries and walked up to the

915
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,530
door cut in Traill I got this here's

916
00:48:54,799 --> 00:49:00,380
just a roll ball see if this sticks and

917
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:02,240
had a box of pastries I tried to

918
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,920
tailgate behind the guy like catch him

919
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,839
as he was walking but he went just a

920
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,940
little too fast for me so I standing

921
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,849
with box of pastries in front of this

922
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:12,440
call box looking to push a button and

923
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:14,240
trying to decide if I was going to or

924
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,069
not and this other gentleman walks up

925
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,930
it's like oh hey you're going to company

926
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:19,308
I was like yeah I got doughnuts someone

927
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,279
ordered doughnuts he's like oh cool come

928
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:25,099
on in so I got inside the building and

929
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,140
then we walked around the hallways and I

930
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:29,630
walked past their door intentionally and

931
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:34,150
he's like no no dude so over here it was

932
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:36,950
probably more like a horrible accident

933
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:38,960
he badges me into their office space and

934
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,950
I walk in and he's like do you know

935
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,200
where you're going I was like yeah I

936
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:44,089
know I'm going I'm going right over here

937
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,319
this looks like a break room I went to

938
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:47,390
the break room through the doughnuts on

939
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:50,240
the table hidden in a conference room

940
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:52,308
did all of my point of contact stuff and

941
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,680
they are like sending emails to

942
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:56,900
internally like still got it whatever

943
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,669
man

944
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,489
but I have very little bit of time so I

945
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:03,109
threw a business card on my pony

946
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:07,069
contacts desk because it's like my

947
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:09,710
calling card no I made it in and then

948
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:12,288
stood around for several hours trying to

949
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,609
just talk to these people about getting

950
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:15,440
in touch with my point of contact

951
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:18,920
because I happened to let it slip that I

952
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,239
was looking for his desk and so they're

953
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,309
talking to them for several hours

954
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,529
without anybody kicking me out and tell

955
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:26,299
one guy happened to reach out to the

956
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:28,219
point of contact like he's not gonna

957
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:29,390
this isn't really you need to leave for

958
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:30,829
most like alright cool can I have your

959
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:35,989
coffee mug they're like yeah you have a

960
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:37,460
coffee mug so I got there so that's kind

961
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:39,319
of the stupid nuts of it there's a lot

962
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,390
that was wrong with that one but it's a

963
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:43,489
mess so we're not really gonna break

964
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:47,288
that one apart why yeah I caught my

965
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:51,920
flight I made it I'm here safe and sound

966
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:53,809
all of these here so with that it's been

967
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,489
a pleasure I appreciate you guys

968
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:57,559
listening to my really silly stories

969
00:50:55,489 --> 00:51:00,099
about breaking into things and stealing

970
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,099
people's stuff
