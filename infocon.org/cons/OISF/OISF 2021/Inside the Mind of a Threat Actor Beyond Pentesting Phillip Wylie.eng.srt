00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,119
conferences

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,960
the virtual thing is okay but nothing

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
beats in person so that's great

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,039
you all are they're virtual i mean

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,238
they're in person and most of your

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:32,960
presenters are

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,559
in person so thanks for having me

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,680
so they mentioned uh my background so no

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,879
need to really skip over

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,920
go through that except for uh i'm an

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,039
innocent lives

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,280
ambassador and champion so i bring

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,039
awareness to this lives foundation

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,879
they help unmask anonymous child

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
predators turn that information over to

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
a law enforcement to hopefully apprehend

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,840
and take these people

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,760
uh off the internet away from

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
harming children i'm also a hacking he's

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
not a crime advocate and board member

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
so my offensive security career path i

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,840
like to share this because

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
it wasn't just a straightforward path

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
you know some some folks that get into

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
cyber security

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,439
uh nowadays maybe they went to school

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,400
got a cyber security degree some iep

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
related degree or some along outlines

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,680
but when i graduated

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
in 1984 from high school

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
we had computers in our school but only

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
the smart kids

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,560
worked with computers so i didn't know

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,960
what i wanted to do for a career

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
i'm a power lifter i've been a power

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
ranger for years and my friends said hey

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,159
you should be a pro wrestler

48
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,040
so i went to wrestling school did that

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
for a few years

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,799
and got married and needed a more uh

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
suitable to marriage occupation

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,560
because there's a lot of traveling or

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
wrestling and when you're getting

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,159
started out the money is not always

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,640
steady

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
because whenever i was wrestling also

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,479
worked as a bouncer

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
and during my time as a pro wrestler i

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
actually wrestled with 750 pound bearers

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
which you can see

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,800
on the slide here so uh

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
the main reason for me sharing all this

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
detail is

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,239
some people think you know i'm not smart

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,760
to do cyber security i can't be a

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,879
pentester

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,360
but you know a former meathead pro

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,640
wrestler

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,800
turned power it turned you know red

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
taper and pentester

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
that anyone can do it i never thought

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,319
i'd get paid to use my mind when i was

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,120
younger

74
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
for an occupation and i've been able to

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
do that so

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
started as a pro wrestler had to find a

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,879
more stable career

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,200
uh became a cat drafter went to like a

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,239
one-year trade school

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,280
did autocad that's where i got my

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,840
exposure to computers

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
a lot of places i worked at didn't have

83
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
i.t

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,879
so i would figure out how to fix things

85
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,160
on the computers and found out that i

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
had more of a talent for the computer

87
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
side of things

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,159
so i taught myself how to build

89
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,319
computers to the nobel network

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,440
network operating system course

91
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,800
got my first job as a sysadmin

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,959
did that for about six years moved into

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
infosec

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
uh the first part of my postset career i

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
was doing network security

96
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
then i moved into application security

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
application security is where i learned

98
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,920
about pen testing

99
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
and i got laid off from my job as a

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
appsec engineer for a mortgage company

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,879
and applied for a job consulting as a

102
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,640
penetration tester which i got

103
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
and so um contesting for several years

104
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,239
and then i wanted

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
to spend some time as a red team lead

106
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,799
for a global consumer product company

107
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,480
so i got to find out some more of the

108
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
details and

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,840
my most current role is the cloud peg

110
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,080
tester so during that time as a red team

111
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,040
lead the company's offensive security

112
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
program their pen testing vulnerability

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,159
scanning

114
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,680
vulnerability assessments and all that

115
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
was very immature

116
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,040
they you know the people that were in

117
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,680
iep

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,480
people even in the security teams did

119
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
not know the difference between

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,360
a vulnerability scan a pen test

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
or a red team engagement and so this

122
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,120
kind of inspired

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
the idea of this talk because about you

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
know people

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
you know some information people need to

126
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,560
need to learn because you know red

127
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
teaming has been generalized over the

128
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
years

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
as just all kinds of security but it's

130
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,120
more detailed than that

131
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,199
so that's where the the idea this talk

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,040
came from and i actually gave this talk

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
for the first time last year

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
at the uh red team village at defcon

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
so kind of this the uh agenda here we've

136
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
kind of covered my offensive security

137
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919
career pathway discover discover discuss

138
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,320
what

139
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
defensive security is uh the different

140
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,600
domains

141
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
of defense attorney uh red team

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
introduction

143
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
renting tools and a red team blueprint

144
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
showing you how to become

145
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
a red teamer as well as resources

146
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
so as uh dr c was mentioning earlier

147
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,360
about

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
being careful with these techniques and

149
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,320
stuff you learn uh this slide i created

150
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,320
the the a new addition to that slide

151
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,759
but i would show the slide to my

152
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,440
students this semester and

153
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
i really like this quote i first started

154
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
in spiderman i hope ben was telling

155
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,199
peter that

156
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,440
great power comes great responsibility

157
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
so any of these skills you learn make

158
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
sure you've got written

159
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
if you're not a pen tester then there's

160
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,440
bug bounties different home labs that

161
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
you can set up

162
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,320
there's dr c mentioned home labs

163
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,199
also there's great opportunities like

164
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,639
hack the box

165
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
try acting that you can get experience

166
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
with so make sure you have written

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,120
permission because you don't get trouble

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
because there's sometimes you will find

169
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,840
people that will

170
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
want you to hack into someone's social

171
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,360
media account

172
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
or they'll say they're going to have you

173
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
want you to perform a pen test so you

174
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:52,880
want

175
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
to make sure that it's not someone

176
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,800
trying to manage you would use your

177
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,319
skills to help them do

178
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,120
illegal activities and so hacking is not

179
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
a crime as an organization that's trying

180
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
to bring awareness that

181
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,600
the skill hacking is not done just for

182
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
criminal activities you know the the

183
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,720
term

184
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
uh some of you have been around for a

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,759
while real i know that

186
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,199
back in the day hacking really didn't

187
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,520
have a lot to do about breaking into

188
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,639
computers

189
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
it was about building things you know

190
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
you see these hackathons

191
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
it has nothing to do with hacking it's

192
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,840
coding so

193
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
a lot of the early hackers and stuff

194
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,919
were actually makers they were

195
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,759
you know building different types of

196
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,039
technology

197
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
altering technologies to do things that

198
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,800
they weren't

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,960
intended to do and enhance capabilities

200
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,919
so uh

201
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,000
hacking's not a crime is trying to help

202
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,960
bring back

203
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
the uh turn back to the original use and

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,319
not

205
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,919
seem to just any people activity

206
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
so what is defensive security offensive

207
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
security is assessing the security of

208
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
target using average

209
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,479
adversarial tactics techniques and

210
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,360
procedures also known as tdps

211
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
it's also commonly known as ethical

212
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
hacking

213
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,560
so there's several different domains

214
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
here but there's two main domains

215
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
pen testing and red teaming and under

216
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
the pen testing domain we see different

217
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
types of pen tests

218
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
some of your most common pen tests that

219
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,880
you normally see are network and

220
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,000
application

221
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
a lot of those things are driven by pci

222
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,440
pci

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,800
dss really drove the need for

224
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
pen testing for regulatory reasons not a

225
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
lot of companies were getting pent tests

226
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,680
done

227
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,120
and it's kind of interesting when i

228
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,039
started my pentest career

229
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
in 2012 uh most companies hired

230
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,800
consultants or contractors to do pen

231
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,919
testing they didn't have their own

232
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,280
internal teams

233
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,759
and now several years later a lot of

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
your major banks have been test teams

235
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
and pretty good size

236
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,800
teams at that so pci really

237
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,720
drew you really made the need

238
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
for pen testing but some of the things

239
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
it also did too is it made the

240
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,360
pen testing so narrow focused that a lot

241
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
of things got overlooked and that's

242
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,680
where

243
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,080
uh you know red teaming has become more

244
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
important because some of the things

245
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
that were getting missed

246
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,879
can be done through red teaming

247
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
engagement

248
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
so we've got network networking network

249
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,599
contest

250
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,319
application cloud social engineering

251
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,000
physical security hardware

252
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,319
vehicles your different types of

253
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,639
transportation your planes

254
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
and automobiles it's really really kind

255
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,960
of cool uh i did an interview

256
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,799
with melissa knight on one of my recent

257
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
podcast episodes

258
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,760
and she was talking about some of the

259
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,080
things she's doing she was hired to

260
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,559
hack connected buses so there's all

261
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,760
sorts of really interesting things you

262
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
can do to get into iot

263
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
and those are really some fun areas to

264
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,279
work in and red teaming is really kind

265
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,800
of a specialization

266
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,360
of pen testing more of an advanced type

267
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,160
of pen testing

268
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
so red teaming doesn't equal pen testing

269
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
the term red team and fantastic have

270
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,839
been used interchangeably for years

271
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,440
while there are similarities there are

272
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
distinct differences between

273
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
true red team independence

274
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
so there's some commonalities between

275
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,760
the two there's you know they're very

276
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,800
similar

277
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
red teaming is it's more of a

278
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,839
specialization

279
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,040
of offensive security so

280
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,160
they both have exploitation they can't

281
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,480
have social engineering revision

282
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
uh they don't always have social

283
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
engineering phishing that maybe

284
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
you know it all depends on the scope of

285
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,120
pentest sometimes

286
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
uh physical security assessments can be

287
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
involved

288
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
so the difference is they're uh red team

289
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,519
it's

290
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,360
you know threat actor emulation

291
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
detection avoidance

292
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,279
less restrictive scope with pin testing

293
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,320
you're not really

294
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
emulating a thread actor you'll use

295
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
thread actor techniques

296
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,959
and you're not really trying to be to go

297
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,279
uh

298
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,760
undetected because with the pentest

299
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
you've got limited time now if you're an

300
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
internal

301
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,279
resource for a company you know working

302
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,000
for a bank

303
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,720
i'll get like a month to do a pen test

304
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,079
as a consultant

305
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,440
i would only get a week and a lot of

306
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,240
that's because the the cost the pen test

307
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
you know to pay a consultant come in to

308
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
spend

309
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
a month on a pen test can get really

310
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,519
costly especially if you have a lot of

311
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,040
targets you need tested in your

312
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,880
environment so

313
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
uh time is of essence you're trying to

314
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,920
get through the test

315
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
so you're not worried about being

316
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
detected uh

317
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
it's more stricter scope as i mentioned

318
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,240
pci

319
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
has really made scopes really now it's

320
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
brought about the need for pin testing

321
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,959
but some people just want the check box

322
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,079
they're not really

323
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,600
concerned with the thorough pen test

324
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
that's not really what they

325
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,000
view their need is but honestly when

326
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,800
you're trying

327
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,240
you're doing penthouse trying to secure

328
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
your environment you really need to

329
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,680
focus on the security

330
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,640
make the compliance pieces part of it

331
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,079
and you know if you make things

332
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
secure most cases you're going to

333
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,120
fulfill that need for compliance

334
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
and so pin testing is vulnerability

335
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,240
focused

336
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,079
so kind of a good way to explain the

337
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,279
tube

338
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
there is needs definitely needs for both

339
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
of those even like vulnerability

340
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
scanning just a vulnerability scan

341
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,399
reoccurring because the time it takes to

342
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,920
do a pen test

343
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,760
you want to do your vulnerability scans

344
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,440
in between that support

345
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
important piece of your vulnerability

346
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
management program

347
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
but a pet test is vulnerability focused

348
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
so any vulnerability

349
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
and you try to exploit any vulnerability

350
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,399
that you find

351
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,000
in a red team engagement you're going

352
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
through trying to find

353
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,480
uh high impact vulnerabilities that can

354
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
be exploited

355
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,800
to emulate a breach so you're going to

356
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
try to find one or two things that can

357
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,839
be exploited

358
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,360
try to break into those you may have a

359
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,760
second one back up in case you lose

360
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
a connection and you can maintain

361
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
persistence and get back in

362
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
but that's it so but there so you can

363
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
see really the the differences between

364
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,680
there

365
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,639
so pin testing is kind of as your

366
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,240
organization's maturing

367
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,839
and red teaming is once your your

368
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,279
organization starts to be a little more

369
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,399
mature

370
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
and red teaming can will a lot of cases

371
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
use more of the social engineering

372
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
because sometimes that's the only way

373
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
to get a foothold into the environment

374
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
as well as some of the physical pin

375
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,040
testing

376
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,320
because this is emulating real world

377
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
threat actors so this may be someone

378
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
this could be script kitties nation

379
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
states some kind of organized crime

380
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
and so the different type of attack

381
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,000
vectors can vary

382
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
there's a lot of common tools a lot of

383
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,560
the tools you use are the same so we see

384
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,079
uh linux for our attack platform windows

385
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,839
a lot a lot of people uh have gotten

386
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
used to using linux but it's a good idea

387
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,839
to use windows 2. there's a lot of good

388
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,880
sysadmin tools that you can use there

389
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,320
that are good for finding

390
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
vulnerabilities

391
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,839
so linux windows based tools metasploit

392
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,160
malware and exploits commanding controls

393
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
we see these are all

394
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
similar but the one difference here we

395
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,320
see vulnerability scanners you're trying

396
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
to be quiet

397
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,399
so you're not going to be running a

398
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,160
vulnerability scanner during

399
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
a red team operation and so

400
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,800
your malware and exploits are going to

401
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
be more heavily used

402
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,040
on red team engagements sending phishing

403
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,920
emails to try to get someone to click on

404
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
some malware so you can get control of

405
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,839
the environment

406
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
and then using c2 is heavily used in in

407
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
red teaming because it's a good way to

408
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
deliver payloads to systems

409
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
uh different types of exploit files and

410
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,800
it's easier to maintain persistence

411
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
because if you're using cobalt strike

412
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
and something happens you have to

413
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
reboot your attacking machine that is

414
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,639
easier to connect back than

415
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
uh pin testing methods are hacking

416
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
because you have to go through

417
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,480
re-execute the exploit in some cases

418
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
with cobalt strike you can maintain

419
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
persistence so that saves time uh it

420
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,959
helps you to be a little more quiet

421
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,360
as well and if you see a lot of the

422
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
breaches of stuff that people

423
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
you know some of these uh threat actors

424
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,560
are using

425
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,760
like cobalt strike c2 i mean it was

426
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
intended for

427
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
good use and not malicious use but just

428
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,079
like a lot of other tools that can be

429
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:04,880
used for

430
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
multi-purpose by multiple types of

431
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,279
people

432
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,720
so kind of more of an introduction

433
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,839
detailed information

434
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,639
on the red team intro it's it's a

435
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,000
scenario-based security

436
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,399
assessment emulating direct factors even

437
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
simulating specific apts

438
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,839
uh are also known as advanced persistent

439
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,560
threats

440
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
a goal of red team operation is to

441
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
simulate real-world breaches not only as

442
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
the operator testing the security of the

443
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
technology they are also testing

444
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,320
the people in the process and one of the

445
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,399
best descriptions i've seen for red team

446
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,240
was given by wirefall the founder of

447
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,160
dallas hackers association

448
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
and he says that the red team tests the

449
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
blueprint

450
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,000
so that's a good point because you're

451
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,880
not just testing the technology

452
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
and so red team operations can take more

453
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
time to plan and perform

454
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
they rely heavily on ocean to

455
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
uh to enumerate information on target

456
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,160
technology that plays

457
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,839
because a lot of cases you're doing more

458
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,680
social engineering

459
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
and you're leveraging this through the

460
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,519
employees that you find that your

461
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,120
phishing campaigns or your

462
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,920
osage to get additional footholds into

463
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,279
that environment

464
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,800
and you know a lot of times you can go

465
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
there you're going to

466
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,199
linkedin and you can see the type of

467
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,880
technologies people are using there

468
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
because their

469
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,079
their dbas may share what type of

470
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,759
databases they're using

471
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,240
you may see what their network engineers

472
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,880
what type of networks

473
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,279
that they use so it's a lot of

474
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,120
information to be collected there

475
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
to launch a social engineering attack

476
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,160
against

477
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
the employees there so detection

478
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,240
appointments is very important to be a

479
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
successful red team operations

480
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,079
we're impersonating an actual threat

481
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,079
agent

482
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,720
as far as the planning goes you can get

483
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,120
into

484
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
more

485
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,399
extensive minor apt-based

486
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
threat actors to emulate or you can be

487
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
more a little less customized

488
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,600
and just kind of do your own thing

489
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
using different tools and techniques

490
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,759
that attract or use

491
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,480
uh red team operations rely on malware

492
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
payloads to gain initial footholds in a

493
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,800
lot of cases

494
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,360
so this is delivered through phishing

495
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,120
emails

496
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
so evasion obvious station is very

497
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,560
important for malware success

498
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
and it's important for getting any kind

499
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
of payloads or exploits to work

500
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,480
in pen testing but here you're really

501
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,839
trying to

502
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,240
uh not only get your payloads to execute

503
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,880
you're trying to go

504
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,839
undetected so you're wanting to be quiet

505
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
that your your payloads and exploits are

506
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,759
obfuscated

507
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
which as as time goes on these different

508
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
endpoint protections

509
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
have become even more advanced and it's

510
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,199
a little more work to

511
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,079
to evade those systems so command

512
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,160
control is an important tool

513
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
to control compromised systems little

514
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,919
payloads elevate privileges lateral

515
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,160
movement and use for persistence

516
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,919
so this makes it easier to gain access

517
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,880
to other systems using lateral movement

518
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
use the elevated privileges and there's

519
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
a lot of nice add-ons and scripts that

520
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,679
you can use

521
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,439
with like cobalt strike that makes your

522
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,280
job easier as a red team operator

523
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,600
this is planned in red team ops so

524
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,640
planning great

525
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,960
ranting mods can be very detailed map

526
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
mapping apts

527
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
from myer attack framework and using

528
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,360
tools like vector

529
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,799
vector is a really nice tool that you

530
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,280
can map out to certain apts

531
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,919
you can manage your your operation as

532
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,360
well as plan it out looking at the

533
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,160
different apds so this is a really good

534
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
tool to to simplify that and so they

535
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,919
could be less complicated

536
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,919
as you kind of mentioned you can just

537
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,000
kind of do your own thing because before

538
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
these apts are discovered uh

539
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,039
you know someone had to create them so

540
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,720
you can kind of do the same

541
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,799
same thing and create your own

542
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
so the visual additional benefits is

543
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
test people processing technology

544
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,720
if activities are not detected the red

545
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
team could work with

546
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
security or the blue team to tune the

547
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
security defense

548
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,000
systems to detect malicious activity

549
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,240
this can be extended onto purple teaming

550
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,080
so purple teaming is something i highly

551
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
recommend and we did some of that

552
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
at the company where i was a red team

553
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,120
lead uh you know

554
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
it takes years of pen tests and

555
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,039
vulnerability scans

556
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,240
to get your maturity of your

557
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,400
organization up to a good

558
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,280
safe level but with purple teaming you

559
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
know you can go through and test

560
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
different tools to see if they're being

561
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,320
detected

562
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,280
if they're not make sure your your set

563
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,039
configure systems where they do detect

564
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,720
that where the people that

565
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
are defending the network and the

566
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
systems can more easily detect that

567
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,799
stuff so working with the

568
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,160
defenders to make uh

569
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
systems uh detect activities

570
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,080
as well as you know not everyone needs

571
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,039
to run powershell

572
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
you need to make sure that people can't

573
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
run like in both manycats or different

574
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,280
tools

575
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
on the system so just taking away

576
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,799
subtools from an

577
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,919
attacker is going to make it more

578
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,000
difficult now you're more advanced

579
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
nation states maybe a little more

580
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
difficult to prevent

581
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,039
but you know there's all levels of

582
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,559
attackers

583
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
below that up to that that you can

584
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
prevent just be able to take away

585
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
a tool from their arsenal is going to be

586
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
able to help make your

587
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,919
environment work more secure and that's

588
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,039
the purple thing that is

589
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
that is a really good thing a lot of

590
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,320
times people think that i really haven't

591
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,960
seen a

592
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,840
just just a purple team in a company

593
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
usually purple teaming is

594
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,440
is a type of engagement like a red team

595
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,160
operation so it's a type of

596
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
you know type of teamwork

597
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,880
between the red team and the blue team

598
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,120
so becoming a red team operator kind of

599
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,640
like my pentester blueprint

600
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
talking book a lot of people are

601
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
interested in getting started so

602
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
to become a red team operator you need

603
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
to build a base so the technology basics

604
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
you need to know this and

605
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
a lot of people getting into pen testing

606
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,880
or red teaming want to jump right into

607
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,919
the hacking

608
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,600
and the fun part but you really need to

609
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
understand the technology

610
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,520
understanding the technology of the

611
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,960
networking

612
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
operating systems active directory these

613
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,400
are very important

614
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,039
technology basics to understand uh i

615
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,120
came from a cis admin background so this

616
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,000
was helpful to me

617
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,640
because our new networking operating

618
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,400
systems and active directory

619
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,080
if you don't know the operating systems

620
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,760
you want to know operating systems

621
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,039
at a cis admin level meaning you don't

622
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,600
have new administrative functions

623
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
on the firewall you could you know from

624
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,039
the command line you can shut down

625
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,960
firewall start stop services

626
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,320
if you have the right privileges so

627
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
those are some things that are very

628
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,240
helpful

629
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,320
you know if you're a pen tester or a red

630
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
teamer and you don't have that

631
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,919
experience you get a shell or command

632
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,360
line to most systems

633
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,559
you'll understand the command line

634
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,320
you'll be doing a lot of google research

635
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,080
and that's going to slow you down

636
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,640
so you know make sure take time to learn

637
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,760
these things

638
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
one of the things i find my myself doing

639
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,159
over the years when it comes to learning

640
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,280
is getting in a hurry

641
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,000
to to learn something so take your time

642
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,120
and learn this don't rush it you know

643
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
understand those those basics then you

644
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
need to understand the hacking piece so

645
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,720
when i got my first

646
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,960
fantastic job security network security

647
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
had says admin background

648
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,400
but i really didn't have pinterest

649
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
experience i didn't have that hacking

650
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,720
piece

651
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,799
so as soon as i started with the company

652
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,039
about a week or about a month or two

653
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,400
into my

654
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,840
career there i purchased the oscp

655
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,520
course went through that eventually got

656
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
certified and so this helped me build

657
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,960
the hacking skills so you need those

658
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
hacking skills

659
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
how to use the tools and techniques and

660
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,760
the

661
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,039
way you're gonna build that is the

662
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,960
reputation and practice

663
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,840
things like hack the box try hack me

664
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,799
vulnerable vms in your home lab

665
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,840
so programming and scripting can be

666
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,720
important here

667
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
and it's really what i've seen it's

668
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
helped take pen testers

669
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
and red teamers to the next level some

670
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,799
of the best red teamers and

671
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
pen testers out there for a good example

672
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
as you look at like harm joy from spec

673
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,720
drops he creates a lot of good red team

674
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,679
tools

675
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,880
as well as some other people in the

676
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
industry but at the same time if you

677
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
don't let not have those skills prevent

678
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,559
you from pursuing

679
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
an offensive security career because i

680
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
also know some really great pin testers

681
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,080
that don't know how to code or script

682
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,600
but the languages that are helpful for

683
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,640
scripting

684
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,679
uh python and powershell

685
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,320
and then you know even bash scripting as

686
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,760
well for linux

687
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,240
operating systems and then golang and c

688
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,720
sharp are popular sometimes powershell

689
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,640
exploits are getting caught so people

690
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
kind of moved over to using more c-sharp

691
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
going is nice because a lot of these

692
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
systems aren't picking up

693
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,960
go lane currently and you can build

694
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,400
portable executables and the thing

695
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
that's so nice

696
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,080
if i want to build a payload to run on

697
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
linux and i'm using mac os

698
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,559
i can compile it to run on linux where i

699
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,720
can compile it to run on windows

700
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,520
so you know with past programming

701
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,039
languages if you need to compile

702
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,480
something to run on the system

703
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
you would have to compile it on a system

704
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,240
that that is similar same operating

705
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,039
system

706
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,240
you know fairly close to the same

707
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,480
version but with golan you can compile

708
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
it on

709
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,039
a totally different system to run on a

710
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,919
system that's

711
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,360
very different than the one you're using

712
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
so it's very

713
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,919
very very good language very powerful

714
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,559
lightweight

715
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,840
it was created by by google

716
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,600
and it's not quite as fast to see but

717
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,440
but uh not far off and it's uh faster

718
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
you know the tools are faster and more

719
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,479
powerful than like python

720
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,039
and so uh once you get the pen testing

721
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,640
based skills like i mentioned the other

722
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
slide

723
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,279
that you need to start focusing on some

724
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
of the red team skills

725
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
like now we're in exploit development uh

726
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
you need a lot of times you get into

727
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,720
you're doing a lot more obfuscation

728
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,799
evasion that's important on both sides

729
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,919
but when you get your red team

730
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,120
operations you're trying to go

731
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,480
undetected

732
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
uh active directory is very important be

733
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
able to exploit active directory because

734
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,000
most enterprises are running

735
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,080
active directory and you can expand that

736
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,520
skill set into learning

737
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,760
the azure active directory there are

738
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,120
some differences there

739
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,159
and some people have hybrid on-prem

740
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,679
and cloud-based azure and

741
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
legacy active directory setups so

742
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
understanding active directory is very

743
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,240
helpful

744
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,039
in those enterprise environments

745
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,520
phishing

746
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,159
social engineering and physical security

747
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,360
exploitation

748
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,279
are skills that you use more often there

749
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
so kind of the hacking skills learning

750
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
path uh i recommend

751
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,559
oscp because one of the things it does

752
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,640
and some people complain about the try

753
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
harder mentality

754
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,080
but the one of the things was when i

755
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,679
went through the oscp it really did a

756
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,279
lot to help me

757
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,919
help me build my hack and foundation so

758
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,679
i highly recommend that and i would go

759
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,880
through the exam

760
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
you know you can put in the time and

761
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,720
effort and really learn these courses

762
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,480
really well but the certification

763
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,080
process what i've found

764
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
is it forces me to work harder you know

765
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,120
you

766
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,799
have to get to a certain level if you're

767
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,640
going to pass the oscp exam

768
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
it's not like you may think i know this

769
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
well enough this forces you to know it

770
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,919
well enough

771
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,440
hack the box and try hacking are good

772
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,159
places to learn uh hack the box is a

773
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,400
good place to test what you've learned

774
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,159
they have the hack the box academy now

775
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,760
to you so you can learn from that

776
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
and try hacking is another one that i

777
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,200
like that's

778
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
really good for people that are beginner

779
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
level hackers that kind of gives you

780
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,200
some detail to help get you started out

781
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
and then social engineering with social

782
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,799
engineering

783
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,080
you know there's different types you can

784
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
do your phishing and fishing

785
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
you know that's the voice uh like

786
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,320
calling someone on a phone

787
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,200
smishing through sms messages gut stuff

788
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
is not as difficult the in-person stuff

789
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,480
you know if you're kind of a nervous

790
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,120
type person then

791
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
calling someone on a phone or trying to

792
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
you know gain access to a building

793
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,320
trying to pull off a certain pretext may

794
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,559
be a little more difficult for you but

795
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,799
as far as the red team are having the

796
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,559
fishing skills and stuff like that

797
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,039
is important if you can't really get

798
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,240
past the

799
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
in-person social engineering then that's

800
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,679
that's not going to stop you there's

801
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,000
people

802
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
that specialize in that area and there's

803
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,159
some people that's pretty much

804
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,760
all they do you know you take jason

805
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,279
street for instance

806
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,960
you know he's an excellent social

807
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,080
engineer and that's mainly what he

808
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,919
focuses on he uses his hacking skills

809
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,760
once he gets into the

810
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,400
into the network or gets a hold of a

811
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
computer in the environment but

812
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,919
but there's some people who specialize

813
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,440
in that alone

814
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,960
and so learning paths with red team

815
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,559
skills

816
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,600
contest academy the red team

817
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,840
labs and elearn security which is now

818
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,799
ine

819
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,640
their penetration testing exchange

820
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,799
extreme is not listed as red team but it

821
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,440
is

822
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,640
a red team course hack the box pro by

823
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,159
rasta roster mouse and roster

824
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,559
pro in zero point security he spot off

825
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,520
his own

826
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,399
uh course uh through zero point security

827
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
which is a really good one

828
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,159
they've got an environment where you

829
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,360
have to

830
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
send a phishing email to gain official

831
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,640
foothold of

832
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,960
the initial foothold in that system so

833
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,159
that's a really good one

834
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,440
you have active directory of the

835
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,840
environment servers you're coming in

836
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,520
from you know you have a simulated

837
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,880
external

838
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,520
facing environment you're coming from to

839
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,480
get into

840
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
a network internally so that's a really

841
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,799
good one

842
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,799
so different tools and resources here so

843
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,320
apt planning attack.buyer.org

844
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,399
that's a really great place to learn a

845
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,000
good that good way to get the idea of

846
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,399
the hacker mindset the threat actor

847
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,200
mindset

848
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,480
seeing how some of these attacks are

849
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,760
pulled off the different tools they're

850
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,559
using

851
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,559
and then vector io i mentioned that

852
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,840
application earlier

853
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,080
this is a nice one for planning out your

854
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,039
your

855
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,760
red team operations you can plan it out

856
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,039
as well as track your original

857
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,000
operations

858
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,720
and then your command and controller c2

859
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,440
the c2matrix.com is a great resource for

860
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,919
finding

861
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,360
different c2s

862
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,799
cobalt strike is a very popular

863
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,480
commercial one but there's

864
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
other tools that are free you can find

865
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,559
on the ct matrix

866
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,559
one of the three ones side of trinity

867
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
and then empire

868
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
which fortunately uh bc security has

869
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,799
taken over because once

870
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,960
uh python 2x was deprecated

871
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,320
the the software had to be rewritten and

872
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,240
bc security updated it and then damio c2

873
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,559
from purple star team aries this is a go

874
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,600
based

875
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,559
uh c2 which came out last year right

876
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,559
around defcon

877
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,640
and then operating systems slingshot

878
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
linux by sans this is a good one it's a

879
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,039
vm with the different pen testing and

880
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,760
hacking tools on it it also includes

881
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,600
uh vector vector.io app

882
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,240
so you can plan out your your red team

883
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,120
engagements

884
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,720
so this is not only you know geared

885
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,080
towards pent testing there's some red

886
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,720
teaming

887
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,120
specific things like vector on there

888
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,559
kali linux and paired os

889
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,360
are great options for other linux based

890
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,440
pack and operating systems

891
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,360
i've become a bigger fan of parrot os

892
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,240
because last year i was doing a wi-fi

893
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,720
pen test and just trying to get some of

894
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,159
the tools and stuff to work with kylie

895
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:44,640
linux

896
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,600
as well as setting up the the gpu

897
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,520
cracker just wasn't working

898
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
so i went over and set it up on paired

899
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
os and it worked really well

900
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,679
i was really impressed because paired os

901
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
has good documentation

902
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,919
uh supporting their their product

903
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,520
whereas kyle linux if you're looking

904
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
stuff up you're gonna

905
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,360
usually find it on their forums or

906
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,039
online for someone else's figuring out

907
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,640
how to fix something but apparent os i

908
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,919
was looking up

909
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,600
uh information on how to set up the gpu

910
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,880
for hashcat and

911
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,320
there was like a little article that

912
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,000
they had on their website that showed

913
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
how to install the drivers

914
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
it was straightforward and i was able to

915
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
get the gpu drivers installed in 15

916
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
minutes so

917
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,760
prior to that i didn't have any

918
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,520
experience with with paired os but i'm

919
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,279
really a big fan of it now

920
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,159
and then there's commando vm by fireeye

921
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,240
for windows it's a set of scripts

922
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,760
that will install packing tools on a

923
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,120
windows vm or windows bare metal install

924
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,559
and this is very important because a lot

925
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,320
of the sysadmin tools are good for

926
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,440
enumerating

927
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,360
active directory it's good for hacking

928
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,559
active directory there's a lot of

929
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,919
different system tools

930
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,640
that are very helpful so if you're a pen

931
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,399
tester or a red teamer it's a good idea

932
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,440
to have access to a windows environment

933
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,840
for testing as well as a linux

934
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,000
environment

935
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,559
some other course resources action box

936
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,120
pro

937
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
as we've mentioned roster labs pentester

938
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,279
academies red team labs

939
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,640
uh sector seven has some great uh

940
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,279
courses they've got malware as well as

941
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,240
red teaming courses

942
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,640
they keep adding to their courses

943
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,799
they're pretty inexpensive

944
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,919
it's usually around 250 to 300

945
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,480
per course where you went to some other

946
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,679
provider it would be

947
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,919
probably a thousand dollars or thousands

948
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,840
of dollars for the same stuff

949
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,679
and zero point security as we had

950
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,760
mentioned that of course

951
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,159
uh you learned security ivs contesting

952
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,440
extreme

953
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
and spec drops their adversary red team

954
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,960
operations course is good

955
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,559
but one thing to keep in mind if your

956
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,440
company does not have cobalt strike

957
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,080
this course is based around cobalt

958
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,640
strike

959
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,080
so you definitely need to have that in

960
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,159
your environment for that class to be

961
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:56,880
helpful

962
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,519
so it's a really good way to get to

963
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,519
learn cobalt strike they have a lab

964
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,799
environment set up

965
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,000
and you're trying to attack the other

966
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
systems on there using cobalt strike and

967
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
some other tools

968
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
and 40 north security they've got some

969
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,480
great stuff the initial

970
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,679
access operations and intrusion

971
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,120
operations because usually there's two

972
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,320
parts

973
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,159
just more the renting piece and then

974
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,880
there's kind of part of the

975
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,200
the malware development stuff like that

976
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,279
some of these courses get into that

977
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,000
and silent break trinity dark side ops

978
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,360
malware dev

979
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,679
and dark side ops adversary emulation so

980
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,880
your malware development

981
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,640
versus the red team simulations

982
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,960
and then sans has their red team

983
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,679
exercises adversary emulation

984
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,320
and then cobalt strike has links to some

985
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,000
different documents and youtube videos

986
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,039
on how to use their product

987
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,000
so certifications there's not a lot of

988
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,320
certifications in that area now

989
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
currently but it is an advanced form

990
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
fantastic so

991
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,840
a next step if you're a network fan

992
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,000
tester you know you're really good at

993
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
social engineering then that's a good

994
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,080
next step

995
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,120
so red team focused certifications

996
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,960
pentester academy and then

997
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,080
zero point security as well as iad and

998
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,640
then pen testing focus certifications

999
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,880
uh defensive securities ocp osce oswe

1000
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,919
and then the sans certs are very sought

1001
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,760
after in e-learning security the united

1002
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,559
security

1003
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,080
servants are kind of starting to become

1004
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,240
more well-known and people are asking

1005
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,440
approach some of those searches in the

1006
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,880
job requirements

1007
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,559
but you know typically if you have like

1008
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,320
an oscp when the offensive security

1009
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
starts those go a long way for

1010
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,440
for getting employed my second

1011
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,320
job of my pent testing career uh the

1012
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,919
company i went to work for since i had

1013
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,519
the oscp they didn't put me through

1014
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,960
their technical

1015
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
assessment where a lot of these

1016
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,039
companies will give you a vulnerable vm

1017
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,399
or an environment or maybe an

1018
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,919
application to perform a pen test

1019
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,080
against try to hack into a system

1020
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,919
so since i had that experience it got me

1021
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,360
past that

1022
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,159
point so so those are some of the

1023
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,360
different things

1024
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
that will help you out career-wise

1025
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,719
courses and stuff so folks there's not a

1026
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,159
lot of books but

1027
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,960
as i said your pen testing is kind of a

1028
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,800
prerequisite for red teaming so those

1029
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,239
are a lot of good books in the area but

1030
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,399
for red team focused the renting

1031
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,000
development and operations

1032
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
practical guide joe best is one of the

1033
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,040
creators of that

1034
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,719
he currently supports cobalt strike

1035
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,480
he used to work for spec drops he was a

1036
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,839
red team operator there

1037
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,119
and this is a really good book because

1038
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,679
this will show you how to set up

1039
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,520
like a red team i used this when i was

1040
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
setting up my red team

1041
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
uh in a previous company so they have a

1042
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,199
red team in place so

1043
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,560
it shows you the different types of

1044
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,480
documentation and things to consider

1045
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,440
plan for renting operations setting up a

1046
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,359
red team

1047
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,040
and then the hands-on red team tactics

1048
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
the practical guide to mastering red

1049
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,918
team operations

1050
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,839
uh this book one of the reasons i really

1051
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,000
like it is because it's got

1052
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,240
information on cobalt strike a lot of

1053
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,599
different resources don't

1054
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
really share about cobols right so this

1055
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,040
is

1056
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,960
this is good and then the the hackers

1057
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,200
playbook this is a great series

1058
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,079
but the latest version of the latest

1059
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,599
book in the series

1060
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,079
version 3 is the red team edition so

1061
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,160
it's focusing more on renting

1062
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,160
type of uh skills so that's a good one

1063
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,960
to use there as well uh there's some

1064
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,160

1128
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,320
take some of those

1129
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
high school classes because our high

1130
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,040
school that i grew up in

1131
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
had some apple to ease so i was

1132
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,880
fortunate enough

1133
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,640
to be able to take those take those in

1134
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,720
high school but that's what really got

1135
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,640
me started of course wargames anybody

1136
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
remember the movie

1137
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,359
yeah with the whopper uh that was that

1138
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,400
was pretty cool too

1139
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,160
so uh but uh yeah i saw

1140
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
hey i just wanted to ask you real quick

1141
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,599
too um so

1142
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,160
i saw you didn't see i didn't see ec

1143
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,200
council with the

1144
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,560
ceh is that not like a big cert anymore

1145
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
for the pen testing side

1146
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,680
for ethical hacking um or do you guys is

1147
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,720
that kind of dying off

1148
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,280
just kind of curious about that yeah

1149
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
it's one of the things about it

1150
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,599
is it's really their exams question

1151
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,480
answer i know they can't with a

1152
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,720
practical one but as far as

1153
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,040
professionals in the industry people

1154
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,520
that are experienced pen testers

1155
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
that's one of the starts they don't ask

1156
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,640
for now if you're doing

1157
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,680
if you're doing business with the

1158
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,440
government they'd like for you to have

1159
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,800
dod certs

1160
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
right and my second consulting job we

1161
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,599
had a project that we were

1162
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,359
bidding on if we got it they would need

1163
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,440
a ceh and they asked me if i would go

1164
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,560
take the exam if it was needed but

1165
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,440
we didn't get get the the job but yeah

1166
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,720
so that's part of the

1167
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,040
the reason for it but you just i just

1168
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,880
don't i actually value the

1169
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,200
pentest plus more but trying to get a

1170
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,000
job as a pen tester

1171
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
ceh and pentest plus really don't help a

1172
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,280
lot i mean even like for

1173
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,640
like some of the entry level starts the

1174
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,359
ejpt cert from i me which look at their

1175
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:03,839
e-learning

1176
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,880
okay junior pen test insert uh that one

1177
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
works pretty that one is pretty good

1178
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,800
because

1179
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,880
there's a lot of hands-on to it and

1180
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,160
that's what employers are looking for

1181
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,040

the back did he beat the bear

1213
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,880
did you beat the bear in wrestling no

1214
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,400
was it a draw well it's

1215
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
the bear didn't take me down

1216
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,000
the bear i didn't take him out so but

1217
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,359
the interesting thing was out of the

1218
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,960
people that wrestled the bear i did the

1219
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,640
best against the bear

1220
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,520
uh but so he was like taking people's

1221
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,800
legs out from my room

1222
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
so if you if you go back and look at

1223
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,079
that picture

1224
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,200
he's got his paw his arm his front

1225
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,359
leg around my legs trying to take me

1226
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,400
down and

1227
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,640
when i saw the other guys wrestling him

1228
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,000
taking their legs out from under him i

1229
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,680
got down kind of in a wrestling position

1230
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
or alignment

1231
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,800
position so my legs were out that

1232
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,160
prevent him from

1233
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,079
be able to get a good hold of my leg and

1234
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,079
take me down
