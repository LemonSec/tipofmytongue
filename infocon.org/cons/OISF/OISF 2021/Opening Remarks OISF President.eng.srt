year

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
uh last year we uh had a pause because

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,759
of the

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,240

so but uh for those uh you know welcome

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,040
again um so we made some changes through

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,680
the year

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,079
uh we went uh virtual for most of the

41
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,280
last year

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
uh due to covert as everybody knows

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,880
we've experienced that wonderful

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
pandemic

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200
so but again i'm glad we're able to come

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
back in person

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,000
and meet again this way it's

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,560
it's so much better and more enjoyable

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,440
to be able to talk

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
with everybody live and in person and

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
not uh virtually

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,160
that's a little bit of a challenge so

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
for those that aren't familiar with ohio

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
information security forum we are a

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,599
non-profit

56
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,680
we we talk about cyber security trying

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
to educate

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,760
users uh we you know network with peers

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,239
and

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,560
we conduct training uh we share

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
knowledge we try and get people to come

62
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,160
in and collaborate

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,239
it's all free it's a non-profit there's

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
no membership fees uh

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,599
a couple graphics up there periodically

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
so

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,159
but again we focus on educating users

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
about cyber security

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,239
so because if you guys learn what the

70
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,599
hackers do

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
then for those that are on the defensive

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,760
side you can take that back to your

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,040
employment and help try and defend your

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
your networks and your systems against

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
people trying to get in so that's what

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
we want to do is we want to educate

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,040
users

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,319
and we do it uh for for free so

79
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,840
we meet monthly uh usually on the

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
second tuesday the second thursday of

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
the month

82
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,840
lately we've been doing it at seven

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,159

uh throughout the year

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
from everybody so uh the only thing that

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,599

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
to the meetings and help share your

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,680
knowledge if you come up

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
with something that you came across and

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,519
you think hey this is kind of cool

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,799
and you want to share it because

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,799
somebody else might learn from it too

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,080
that you know we ask you to come out

106

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,400

oisf just just feel free to ask us so

127
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
but uh you know we we need you to help

128
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
sponsor this because we want to keep it

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,800
free

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,240
right and so we're always looking for

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
sponsors to help with

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
paying the costs uh unfortunately it was

133
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,400
a bad year

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
we didn't get any platinum sponsors this

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,400
year uh people were pretty tight with

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
the purse springs and stuff like that so

137
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,520
uh mtsi gave us some money we got a

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
couple guys that are on the board

139
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
so and they there's some stuff outside

140
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,720
for that again we didn't have any silver

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
sponsors either

142
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
but you know the other way we get money

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,199
is through amazon smile

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
so they i don't know if people are

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
familiar with that but we do donations

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
we get a percentage of things that are

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,759
purchased and if you use the amazon

148
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,720
smile

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
link and select oisf

150
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,360
we get we get portions of that donated

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
to us so

152
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
um if you if you want to do that if you

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,720
click on the

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,880
qr code you know you'll it'll take you

155
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
there so

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,199
these slides will be available after the

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,479
conference we'll put them up on our

158
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,960
website so

159
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
in case you didn't get a chance to scan

160
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
the codes

161
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
another way is you can make a donation

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
right so right to paypal that comes to

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
us as well

164
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,880
so you'll see some of the banners up

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,520
again you know we try and keep this free

166
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,759
for everybody to come out so unlike some

167
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,280
of the bigger conferences you got to pay

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
a couple thousand dollars to go to

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
some of the training the monthly events

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,560
that we do we cover the pizza

171
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,759
and and the facility so we're back here

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,400
again

173
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
and again they're uh you know we have to

174
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,479
use the facility here so

175
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,039
uh we cover the expenses for all that

176
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,800
stuff through donations only

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,759
so because we are a non-profit so and it

178
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,600
is tax deductible for you or your

179
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
organization if they want to make a

180
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,680
donation

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,720
so um all right so

182
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
huge thanks to some of uh they're not

183
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,440
our our sponsor sponsor but they've done

184
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,880
a lot for us so irg is the new realty

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,840
company that

186
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
owns this facility and they're letting

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
us use this place which is

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
miami valley research park but they're

189
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
going to be changed in the name of it

190
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,039
soon because it's a new reality company

191
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:09,599
and which

192
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,360
name for those that checked for wi-fi

193
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
i think everybody saw the name what was

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
the name

195
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
sixth river right so that's going to

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
become the new name of miami valley

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,120
research park so

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,599
you should be seeing that soon uh coming

199
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,560

246
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,640
meetings

247
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
so uh for those that will be back in

248
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
here so we were doing virtual

249
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
but uh now that uh well we'll have to

250
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
see how the delta and whatever else

251
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,640
comes out if that's gonna allow us to

252
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
continue to meet in person or not so

253
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
uh but these are the dates uh if for

254
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
some reason we do have to go virtual

255
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
then um we'll put that word out

256
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
so but these are the dates that we're

257
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
going to have for the rest of the year

258
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
uh i think the 18th is in was it the

259
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
18th

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
oh we moved that back a week that's

261
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
right because it was originally

262
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,519
scheduled the week before

263
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,160
for november because of veterans day and

264
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
that's an actual holiday it actually

265
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
falls on that thursday this year

266
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,760
so we decided to move it back one more

267
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
week so it's the week between veterans

268
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,160
day and thanksgiving

269
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,640
so we pushed it back a week for that one

270
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,839
because make it easier

271
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,279
all right so uh

272
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,399
i always like to steal a little uh i

273
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:48,959
thought

274
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,320
i i got a kick out of the summer if

275
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,760
everybody else did so we all got kenny

276
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,200
loggins right

277
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
so for those that know who kenny loggins

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
is i don't think we have any

279
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
younger guys who may not younger folks

280
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,880
don't know who kenny loggins is

281
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
i'm all right so oh now i'm really

282
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,160
showing my age

283
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
all right so just a couple remarks i

284
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
found this report came out about

285
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,440
maybe two months ago a month ago or

286
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
something like that so trend micro

287
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,120
uh 2020 annual cyber security report uh

288
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
pretty good information you go out to

289
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
trenton micros website

290
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,800
and find it i forgot to put the link up

291
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,200
but

292
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
i just want to talk about it real quick

293
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
uh how they uh

294
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
last year was uh pretty big for a lot of

295
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
cyber security stuff

296
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
going on and you know the big thing in

297
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
the news is of course

298
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
uh two things the the covet and the

299
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
ransomware

300
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
so uh last year was huge huge huge

301
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,079
uh for uh stuff that went out that

302
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,680
related to coven 19.

303
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
obviously because a lot of the hackers

304
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,519
are taking advantage of the pandemic

305
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,360
you know putting the fear out of people

306
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
and saying click now to do this or to

307
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,720
get your money remember we were getting

308
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,800
all this free money last year

309
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,560
so we don't have to work but

310
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,360
a lot of targeted attacks uh some of it

311
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,320
was on critical

312
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
industries all right those are the uh

313
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
malware attacks

314
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,240
and then the kova 19 because everybody

315
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,360
shifted to home

316
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
and then they were offering all this

317
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,279
free money uh to help

318
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,360
offset people not working and stuff like

319
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
that so

320
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
uh but the other part is is the cloud

321
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
and the iot stuff and mobile

322
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,880
uh environments so that that became

323
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,440
that's

324
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
a continuing rise so on and and daryl's

325
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,760
gonna talk about some of that a little

326
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,800
bit later today

327
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
some of the uh mobile and iot stuff

328
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
right

329
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,440
yeah sort of so uh you know perfect and

330
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,240
then uh

331
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
obviously the vulnerability so we need

332
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
to make sure

333
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
that we know what and understand what

334
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,480
those vulnerabilities are and how to

335
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,120
protect them

336
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
and how to fix them so that's that's the

337
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
big thing and then of course a lot of

338
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
these

339
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,079
defensive measures are becoming more

340
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,600
complex and and they're

341
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
multi-layered security things that you

342
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
need to put in place so oh

343
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,639
so one of the things that you might see

344
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,240
on some of the websites credential

345
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,800
fishing

346
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,079
right i don't know how many you came

347
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,440
across this right they're looking

348
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
forward to steal your information so

349
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
then they

350
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
this was in the report this is one of

351
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,760
the big areas they want to steal your

352
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,519
information through credential phishing

353
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,079
create false logins and then make you

354
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
think that you logged in properly

355
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
they do a man in the middle where they

356
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
relay the information or they just

357
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,320
grab yourself make it look like an error

358
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
and you sign in again but by now they

359
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,519
already got your information and all

360
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,120
your login stuff so that was one of the

361
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
big things was credential phishing

362
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
uh malicious spam obviously look at

363
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,639
those huge

364
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
number of email subjects that were

365
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,399
compiled

366
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,160
over the years and look how many 16.3

367
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,639
almost

368
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,519
16.4 million emails that are related

369
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,279
just to cover 19

370
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,839
with those subject lines uh majority of

371
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,959
them so

372
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,399
uh that was just last year and that

373
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
was in the in the report that they they

374
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,519
put out so i thought that was pretty

375
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,160
interesting

376
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,120
to see the numbers of uh the attacks and

377
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,600
and

378
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
the way the defenses that we need to

379
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
make sure we understand and are

380
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
protected and taken care of

381
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
so or you know if you are really a bad

382
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,360
guy

383
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,279
you know a different way to do it so and

384
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
then the i home iot

385
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,200
right so that's another big area

386
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,399
everybody went home

387
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,240
right because of covet so now they

388
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,920
where's the focus going to be where are

389
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,519
you working from you're working at home

390
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
what are the security measures at home

391
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
usually they're not as good as the

392
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,839
enterprise so people are like ah

393
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,760
not worried about my laptop not worried

394
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,839
about my ipad or my phone

395
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,720
or my home router because no one's gonna

396
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,240
attack that but now that you're working

397
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,839
from home you have a vpn

398
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
in if they can get in through your home

399
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,519
router and then get to your laptop and

400
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,279
then use the vpn into your enterprise

401
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
now they're getting all that information

402
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,120
so that became another huge focus area

403
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
so

404
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,360
oh and of course social media right how

405
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,959
do people think they're getting hacked

406
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,000
right they think there's some guy

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
they're hacking and

408
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,519
and they're not so but uh social media

409
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,959
answering all those lovely questions

410
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,959
that you see on facebook

411
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,360
uh anybody do those hopefully not in

412
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,160
this crowd

413
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,360
but i you know got to remind my friends

414
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,800
periodically that or not into the uh

415
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
you know the information security side

416
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,800
and remind them not to answer these

417
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,920
questions

418
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,800
so because you wonder why the the

419
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,199
question set changes if you ever wonder

420
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,560
you know when you're answering your

421
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
security questions why you know some of

422
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,839
those change and then you see these

423
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,680
questions pop up on facebook that's why

424
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,600
so anyways uh so standard disclaimer we

425
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
got to put

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,199
up there because we're going to show a

427
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,920
bunch of techniques that uh

428
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,399
you may try uh and if you do that's

429
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,519
great

430
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,120
but don't try it on somebody else's

431
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
network and

432
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,279
if you get caught right don't come

433
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,920
saying hey well i learned that at oisf

434
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,399
and so uh we have to throw this up there

435
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,839
to keep ourselves out of legal trouble

436
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,880
right so anyway so we cover

437
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,000
there especially during our monthly

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
meetings we get into some of the very

439
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
technical depths of how to actually you

440
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,399
know crack wi-fi or some other

441
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
uh dns or you know cross-site scripting

442
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,480
we get into those things so you know if

443
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
you try that hopefully you can set up a

444
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,199
lab at home we had a couple

445
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,720
monthly meetings where we talked about

446
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,839
how to do

447
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,079
you know cali linux on a raspberry pi

448
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,519
and how to actually do that or build a

449
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,360
home lab so you can practice this stuff

450
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
at home

451
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,440
and it'd be fairly cheap so

452
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,800
all right so today's agenda we've got a

453
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,639
great lineup right so we're going to

454
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,600
start with

455
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
philip he's going to talk about inside

456
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
the mind of a hack of a threat actor and

457
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
then mike is going to follow up

458
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
so philip is going to be virtual he's uh

459
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,320
down in texas

460
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,399
and then also we have edmond later this

461
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,000
afternoon he's going to be virtual

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
as well the rest of us are here live in

463
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
person which is great

464
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
that we are able to meet again we're

465
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
going to have lunch

466
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,160
uh we're going to bring that in we'll

467
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
get pizza cousin vinnie's pizza

468
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
and then when that 3 o'clock because

469
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,519
it's our anniversary we're gonna have

470
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,800
some cake

471
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
so uh we'll have that at three o'clock

472
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,240
so

473
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
we'll try and keep on schedule with this

474
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
uh and uh take the breaks appropriately

475
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,079
so um we're gonna

476
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,480
go ahead and get started as soon as we

477
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
can get

478
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,240
philip up on the screen uh and then get

479
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,000
uh

480
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,079
things going with him so in the meantime

481
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,600
while he's getting that up there

482
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
so his title is inside the mind of a

483
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,600
threat actor beyond pen testing

484
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
so uh just a quick abstract uh you know

485
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,079
red team is commonly misunderstood

486
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,720
offensive security discipline red team's

487
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,279
been used

488
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,279
as a general term for all areas of

489
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,880
offensive security

490
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,959
uh just as blue team for defensive

491
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,279
security uh true red teaming goes beyond

492
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,480
pen testing

493
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
more into adversarial mla emulation

494
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,360
so while there's overlapping skills

495
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,199
right because he as a defensive guy you

496
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,800
know what the offense is doing and stuff

497
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,519
like that so

498
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,800
you need to have those overlapping

499
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,079
skills and that's what we try and do

500
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,360
here

501
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
he shares his experience as a pen tester

502
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,959
from a red teamer

503
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,120
so you learn about different thread

504
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,959
areas that make up red team operations
