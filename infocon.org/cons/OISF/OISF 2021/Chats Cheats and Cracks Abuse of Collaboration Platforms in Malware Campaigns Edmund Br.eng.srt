1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,240
lack to enable employees to communicate

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,160
communicate more effectively

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,920
attackers have recognized this and begun

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,440
leveraging these platforms supporting

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,800
the various purposes

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,719
this presentation will discuss how

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,400
attackers are using collaboration

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,719
platforms through various stages

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,079
of their power attacks and what

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,000
organizations can do to defend against

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,680
these attacks

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,240
edmund is a threat researcher with cisco

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080
talos he spent several years

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
protecting environments across a number

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
of different industries

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,599
including nuclear energy financial

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,480
services

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,800
et cetera he currently spends his days

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,760
hunting malware

20
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
and analyzing various threats as they

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
emerge and continue to evolve

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,000
in his time with towels he's researched

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
ransomware and other threats being

24
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,399
distributed

25
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,960
using various attack vectors it's also

26
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,039
worked to expose large-scale malware

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,079
campaigns

28
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
and weight raise awareness of security

29
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
threads observed through the

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
front landscape so like like i mentioned

31
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,920
briefly

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
at the opening remarks uh you know a lot

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,120
of that

34
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
uh this ties into that so i'm gonna go

35
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
ahead and turn it over to edmund again

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,640

37
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,479
doing this for us i know you're down in

38
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,479
texas a different time zone and all that

39
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,200
stuff but

40
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,119

me uh just a disclaimer my internet

50
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
actually dropped about

51
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,560
three to five minutes ago so i'm coming

52
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,400
in over cellular so uh let's see how

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,119
this uh

54
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,759
how this goes we'll do it live um so

55
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200
yeah thanks for having me my name is

56
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
edmund bromingen i wanted to talk a

57
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
little bit today about collaboration

58
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,520
platforms

59
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
as everyone's aware at this point the

60
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
pandemic

61
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
caused a significant number of changes

62
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
across a lot of enterprise workflows a

63
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
lot of organizations that

64
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,799
at one time were relying on employees to

65
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,040
communicate by being in the same room or

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
in the same physical building and had to

67
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,759
adapt to

68
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,360
changes in uh work from home situations

69
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,719
that have required

70
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
a remote employee collaboration to

71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
become a more significant part of

72
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
a lot of enterprise workflows so a lot

73
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
of organizations have turned to

74
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
collaboration platforms like discord and

75
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
slack to facilitate more efficient more

76
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,480
effective

77
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,239
communication between employees that may

78
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,840
be located in different

79
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,879
physical locations so as these platforms

80
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,599
have

81
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,280
achieved significant increases in

82
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,520
popularity adversaries have also

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,720
recognized

84
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
several different opportunities to

85
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
leverage these same platforms across

86
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
their attacks so i wanted to kind of

87
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,200
talk about

88
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,599
those what we're seeing how these

89
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
platforms are being abused and i want to

90
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
focus on three specific

91
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
phases for lack of a better term of a

92
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,519
typical

93
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,440
malware infection or a typical malware

94
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
attack i want to talk about

95
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
how they're leveraging these platforms

96
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,319
across the initial

97
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,239
malware delivery phase so how the

98
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,840
initial malicious content is being

99
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
delivered to victims

100
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,519
i also want to talk about how they're

101
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,360
leveraging platforms like discord and

102
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
slack

103
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,720
during the infection process typically

104
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,400
um you know this involves the retrieval

105
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
of additional malicious components right

106
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,280
a lot of the malware

107
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
infections that we're seeing are no

108
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,360
longer um single-stage infections in a

109
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
lot of cases they rely on multiple

110
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,360
disparate stages of

111
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,519
execution a lot of times that involves

112
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,400
the retrieval

113
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
of additional payloads of additional

114
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
modules

115
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,400
of additional functionality that then is

116
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
leveraged later on and then

117
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
finally i want to talk about uh you know

118
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,640
what we're seeing from a command and

119
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,440
control and

120
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
post compromise perspective so what

121
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
happens once the malware is on the

122
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,319
system

123
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
how are we seeing and leveraging these

124
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
same platforms at that stage as well

125
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
so just to start out and give you a

126
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,480
little bit of background on me

127
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,840
my name is edmund bromigen so i'm a

128
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,599
security researcher with cisco tablets

129
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,400
i've been on the

130
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
talos team for a little over five years

131
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,239
now prior to that i spent

132
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
a decade in security operations so i've

133
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
had pretty much every role you can hold

134
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
on security operations team analyst

135
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,159
engineer architect

136
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
all the way up to sock team lead um i

137
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,239
love malware that's that's

138
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,720
that's what i do um since joining the

139
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
talos team my focus has been primarily

140
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
on financially motivated cyber crime so

141
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,360
e-crime or crime work depending on who

142
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,640
you're talking to

143
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
and i also do embedded systems and iot

144
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
related research as well

145
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
so let's dive right in let's talk about

146
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,240
the two

147
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,479
major collaboration platforms that we're

148
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,840
seeing abuse

149
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
in a lot of these attacks so you've got

150
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,880
discord uh

151
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
and slack so just to kind of compare and

152
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
contrast the two platforms a little bit

153
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,199
uh discord was uh initially very popular

154
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
in the uh in the gaming community

155
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
uh so if you you think about back in uh

156
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
back in the day you used to

157
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,919
you know play world of warcraft and when

158
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,600
you're trying to coordinate your raids

159
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
you would hop on ventrilo and you would

160
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,280
voice chat with other members of your

161
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,479
guild or whatever

162
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,280
um very similar concept but a lot of the

163
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
um the gaming community has moved from

164
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
platforms like teamspeak and discord or

165
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,759
teamspeak in ventrilo over to

166
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,840
discord it allows instant messaging

167
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,600
audio and video calls

168
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,639
um it has apis exposed for automating

169
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,479
interactions with the platform so you

170
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,560
can program bots

171
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
various automations that take advantage

172
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
of this api

173
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
to uh to interact with the discord

174
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,960
platform

175
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
last i checked they they

176
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
specified that they are currently seeing

177
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
about 140 million monthly users

178
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
so pretty significant footprint as far

179
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,759
as um you know

180
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,919
individuals and and whatnot that are

181
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,440
taking advantage of discord

182
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
uh so as the pandemic has kind of uh you

183
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,360
know continued

184
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
uh we've seen discord start to be used

185
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,880
for things other than just gaming if you

186
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,000
think about a lot of even the

187
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
information security conferences that

188
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,039
have taken place over the last you know

189
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,479
12 to 18 months

190
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,479
many of them are using discord as the

191
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
primary mechanism or the primary

192
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
platform to facilitate the conference

193
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
you think about defcon cactus con some

194
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
of these other conferences

195
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
the primary way that you attend the

196
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
conference is using a platform like

197
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,880
discord

198
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,199
so uh likewise we have slack everyone's

199
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,720
probably familiar with slack if you're

200
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,280
not

201
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
it offers similar functionality you can

202
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,319
chat

203
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
you can make audio and video calls this

204
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,960
platform is more typically catering

205
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,440
towards

206
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,160
enterprise use or collaboration between

207
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
employees inside of a workplace

208
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,400
instead of calling their instances

209
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
servers out like discord does they tend

210
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
to refer to them as workspaces

211
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
like discord they also have an api that

212
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
can be used for

213
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,520
similar purposes to what i previously

214
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
described and

215
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
according to slack they have about 10

216
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,479
million daily users

217
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,720
so as these numbers have uh you know

218
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,600
increase

219
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
uh throughout the pandemic adversaries

220
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
have recognized that they're a pretty

221
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
attractive

222
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
um platform for use across different

223
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
malware attacks

224
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,400
and we've seen this uh over the past 12

225
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
to 18 months discord and slack are now

226
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
being used for various purposes

227
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
uh during the distribution of a variety

228
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
of different malware families so you've

229
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
got steelers like agent teslin loki bot

230
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,360
you've got

231
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,919
commercial and non-commercial rats

232
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,400
you've got

233
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,680
a key loggers uh there's a variety of

234
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,400
different

235
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,520
threats that are that are being targeted

236
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,160
towards

237
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,479
victim organizations and uh one of the

238
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,000
things that we found interesting when

239
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,759
doing this research was the

240
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,000
adversary's reliance on discord and

241
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
slack for various purposes and that's

242
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,800
kind of what i wanted to drill

243
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,599
into today so i want to start out by

244
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,400
talking about the

245
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
the initial stage of most infection

246
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
processes the

247
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
malware delivery stage right this is how

248
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,880
the malicious the initial and malicious

249
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
contents are being delivered to a

250
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
potential victim

251
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
uh so when you think about this this

252
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
would be emails with hyperlinks this

253
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:36,960
could be

254
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,520
malicious office documents or a variety

255
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,199
of other

256
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,880
communication mechanisms this could be

257
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,639
chats within the platform

258
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,960
uh where you know someone is posing as

259
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,840
uh one of the

260
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
victims contacts and says you know here

261
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,599
you download this uh this file and

262
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,879
execute it to

263
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,520
um do xyz whether that's you know

264
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
generating cheat codes for games or

265
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,639
whether that's an

266
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,120
invoice or a receipt or a purchase order

267
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,479
or you know any of the other

268
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,319
common orders that we that we typically

269
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,919
see

270
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,240
so in order to understand how these

271
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
platforms are being leveraged at this

272
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,199
stage of the

273
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,440
the typical attack process you need to

274
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,479
understand how

275
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,280
the uh content delivery mechanisms

276
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
within these platforms work

277
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
so if you're uh if you've ever used

278
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
discord you're probably familiar you

279
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
join servers those servers can have a

280
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
bunch of different

281
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,639
uh rooms or channels um if you will

282
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
and you can chat with people you can

283
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,880
start uh audio video

284
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,559
conferencing functionality within the

285
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
platform and one of the things that you

286
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,279
can do is you can

287
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,000
upload files right you can attach images

288
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
you can attach gifs you can post memes

289
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,479
you can

290
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,320
attach pretty much any file that you

291
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,160
would like what a lot of people don't

292
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
recognize is that when you do this the

293
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
file that you upload even to that

294
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
private channel or that private server

295
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,399
that you're a

296
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,279
member of um that file is available to

297
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
anyone on the internet regardless of if

298
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,279
they even have discord installed or have

299
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
ever authenticated to discord

300
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
if you know the url and you can see an

301
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
example of that here right

302
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
i had a dumpster fire animated gif that

303
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
i uploaded to a test channel that i

304
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,080
created

305
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,200
and you can see that if you look at the

306
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
metadata associated with that image

307
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
within discord you can obtain

308
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,320
the hard-coded url that points to the

309
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,560
same file so this holds true for

310
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
any sort of attachments that you upload

311
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,160
into discord

312
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,440
and so you can see how this is right for

313
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,399
abuse

314
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,760
from an attacker standpoint right it

315
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
doesn't cost any money to set up your

316
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,360
own discord server you can do it for

317
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,920
free

318
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,160
and then you can begin to attach files

319
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,120
uh

320
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
keeping track of the urls that point to

321
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
those individual files and

322
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
uh in a lot of cases adversaries of

323
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
doing that and then leveraging

324
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
the discord content delivery network to

325
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
facilitate the delivery process to

326
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
a victim when you think about it it

327
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
makes a lot of sense from an adversarial

328
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
perspective right they don't have to pay

329
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,480
for

330
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,800
hosting costs they don't have to own a

331
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,560
bunch of content management systems on

332
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
the internet and use those for

333
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
distribution

334
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,560
and they can leverage a legitimate

335
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
platform that a lot of organizations

336
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,360
have come to use for legitimate purposes

337
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,000
meaning that

338
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
in a lot of cases this this url this

339
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,079
domain this platform

340
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,760
may not be filtered at an ingress egress

341
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,959
point within a victim

342
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,279
organization's environment uh so we're

343
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
seeing a lot of of that sort of activity

344
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
from from an adversarial perspective

345
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
and not to just pick on discord slack

346
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,519
supports a very similar

347
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,760
uh type of functionality uh in this

348
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
particular case one of the main

349
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,240
differences that

350
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,399
instead of the file being accessible by

351
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,399
default you actually generate a public

352
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,200
link for

353
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,279
the specific file that you want to you

354
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,800
know share or

355
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
put in an email or however you you know

356
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
adversaries feel like they can best

357
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,959
deliver that to its potential victims

358
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
and then once you've done that again you

359
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,399
can access the the file that was

360
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,839
uploaded into slack from you know

361
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,200
anywhere in the world regardless of

362
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
whether you have the app installed or

363
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
have a slack account or anything like

364
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,000
that

365
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
so how are we seeing this abused well if

366
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,120
you

367
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,920
look at some of the the most common uh

368
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
malware sample repositories

369
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,079
in this case i just took a quick search

370
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,000
of a virus total

371
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,519
and you can search based on you know

372
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,440
what urls or what domains

373
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,760
a specific file may be reaching out to

374
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,560
in this case

375
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
uh the content delivery net network for

376
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,760
discord is cdn.discord.com

377
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,000
just doing a quick search in dt back in

378
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
april when we initially

379
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
published this particular research

380
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
platform is about 17 and a half thousand

381
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,680
samples i just did a quick search today

382
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,480
um and that number is up to 28 thousand

383
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,959
so

384
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,760
uh clearly there's some some volume uh

385
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,200
volumetric increases

386
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
that we've seen recently and i don't

387
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
expect that to stop anytime soon

388
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,560
adversaries recognize that a lot of

389
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,000
organizations trust

390
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,720
these platforms and as such by

391
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
leveraging them they get to take

392
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
advantage of the

393
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,200
tls encryption of communications with

394
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,320
these platforms

395
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
they're uh any sort of malicious

396
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,680
downloads

397
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,079
look just like any other communications

398
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,519
with discord where you're interacting

399
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,720
with the file

400
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
so it is easier to blend in they can

401
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
circumvent

402
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
a network based analysis of

403
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
tcp connections uh while they're

404
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,160
facilitating that delivery process

405
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
and they don't have to do anything as

406
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
far as a cost

407
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,079
goes in in terms of hosting these files

408
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,240
so the way we're typically seeing the

409
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
these implemented is in the form of

410
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
malicious fan campaigns so malicious

411
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
email campaigns

412
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
uh that contain links to files stored on

413
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,680
the the discord cd and you can kind of

414
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,800
see on the graph this

415
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
kind of shows the volumetric increase

416
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
we've seen it started right around

417
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,120
uh you know the april uh 2020 time frame

418
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,600
which

419
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,959
coincidentally is when a lot of

420
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,639
organizations began to kind of leverage

421
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,000
these platforms

422
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
for more purposes within their

423
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,800
enterprise workflows

424
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
so most of the time when we see these

425
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
used you'll see an email that

426
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,079
that is set to a potential victim that

427
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,160
email will contain a link to a file

428
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,519
stored on the discord

429
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,160
or slack uh content delivery network uh

430
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
in most cases

431
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
um we've seen them use compressed

432
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
archive formats

433
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,160
so what they'll do is they'll take their

434
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,920
malware payload they'll compress it

435
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
using any number of different

436
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
compression algorithms

437
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,200
and then they'll link to that and again

438
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
this just provides another objection

439
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,320
mechanism there because if you're

440
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,120
inspecting the

441
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,200
contents of the network communications

442
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
you may see

443
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,360
a gzip blob and not be able to obtain

444
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
any additional information about what's

445
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,160
stored in the the compressed archive

446
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,399
so here's just an example of an email

447
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,240
that i thought was interesting so

448
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
this email is attempting to get the

449
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
victim to open

450
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
a file that they say is attached you can

451
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,600
kind of see there's

452
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
what looks to be a pdf attached to the

453
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,880
to the email

454
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
what was interesting about this is when

455
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
you look at the actual source code

456
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,079
there's no pdf attached to the email

457
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,760
what they had actually done was they had

458
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,880
hyperlinked to

459
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,000
a file stored on the uh the discord cd

460
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and in this case it was an iso

461
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,600
archive and the pdf graphic that you saw

462
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
in the email was simply then using

463
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,720
an image source of a jpeg so they made

464
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,279
it appear as if there was a pdf

465
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,199
which you know are pretty common in most

466
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,199
enterprises and

467
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,040
they were basically on the back end

468
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
linking to a file stored in the

469
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
the discord content delivery network to

470
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,680
facilitate the delivery of the initial

471
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,440
payload in this case so that's kind of

472
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
what we've seen from a delivery

473
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
standpoint we're seeing

474
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
attackers host their contents on this

475
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
discord or slack cdn

476
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
and then leveraging something like

477
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,720
either chat within the platform

478
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,839
or email with a hyperlink um that

479
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,079
that facilitates the delivery of the

480
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,720
initial stage of the infection

481
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
uh once that's that's happened in a lot

482
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,839
of cases uh

483
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,880
you enter kind of a component retrieval

484
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,480
stage and this is where the malware

485
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
that's initially executing on the system

486
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,760
may need to go out and retrieve

487
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
additional components

488
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
to facilitate different functionality

489
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
that the malware wants to take advantage

490
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,040
of

491
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
so you might see modules being

492
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
downloaded to perform a variety of

493
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,839
functions or

494
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,120
they may simply have broken their

495
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
infection across multiple stages to try

496
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,519
to

497
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,199
add a layer of obfuscation and make

498
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,680
analysis more difficult

499
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
so a good example of this is with the

500
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,199
second stage payload retrieval

501
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,920
so once the the initial malicious

502
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
content is being executed

503
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,079
on an endpoint or on a system in a lot

504
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,760
of cases what we're seeing is that

505
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,079
second and third stage payloads are

506
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,760
being retrieved using a very similar

507
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,199
mechanism to what i described

508
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
uh before they're basically hosting

509
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
their stage to

510
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,040
pe32 executable in these content

511
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,160
delivery networks

512
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,759
and then when the initial stages of an

513
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,440
infection kicks off when some macros

514
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,000
execute

515
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
or when a script is is invoked uh

516
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
you know in powershell uh that is

517
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
responsible for going out again to the

518
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,079
disorder slack cdn and pulling down

519
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,920
subsequent stage payloads that they can

520
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,040
use to

521
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
increase their their sphere of control

522
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,560
over the

523
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,680
endpoint that they're operating on so

524
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,079
in this particular case uh i on the

525
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,440
previous slide you can see there

526
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,040
is a pcap screenshot that shows the http

527
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,240
stream

528
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,720
associated with the retrieval of a

529
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
second stage component in this case it

530
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
was associated with rimcotes which is a

531
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,279
commercial

532
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,320
uh rat that we see pretty commonly

533
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,759
across the bright landscape there are a

534
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
variety of different threat actors that

535
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,839
are trying to leverage rimcos

536
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
to operate against organizations to

537
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,320
operate against individuals

538
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
in this particular case persistence or

539
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
the ability to re-execute the malware

540
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,199
anytime the system is rebooted was

541
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
performed using uh registry run keys

542
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,759
again one of the most common ways we see

543
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
persistence achieved during the

544
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,959
infection process they created a

545
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,160
registry entry

546
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,759
uh under the uh the default run key

547
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,279
location within the windows registry

548
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,519
that pointed to a windows shortcut file

549
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,560
and when you look at that windows

550
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,320
shortcut file that's what points to the

551
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,880
actual

552
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,320
rimcos payload itself in this particular

553
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
case that secondary

554
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,399
uh component that was retrieved was

555
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
basically an xor blob

556
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,720
they would uh reverse the xor process

557
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,559
and then inject that into a remote

558
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,240
process on the infected system but

559
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
that's kind of what this looked like

560
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,760
um the the interesting component here

561
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,359
being you know the use of

562
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,559
that uh that slack or discord cdn for

563
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,359
the retrieval of that component

564
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,959
here's another example in this case it

565
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
was a malicious word document

566
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
um you can see from the uh the title the

567
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
the file name of the

568
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,160
word document that this was turkish

569
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
and they were basically making this

570
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
document appear as if it would be

571
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
associated with discord nitro codes

572
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,840
which is kind of a paid

573
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
tier of discord that allows you some

574
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,760
additional functionality

575
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,440
on the platform so in this case uh the

576
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
office the office document they didn't

577
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
put a lot of effort into putting a decoy

578
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,919
image or

579
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,880
a prompt uh for the user to disable the

580
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,720
security mechanisms in word they simply

581
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,200
left

582
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,360
the document blank but inside of the

583
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,960
document were malicious

584
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
office macros and you can see an example

585
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,360
of one of these macros here you can see

586
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,000
it's been

587
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
lightly obfuscated but it's responsible

588
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,919
for spawning w script on a windows

589
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:10,960
endpoint and then

590
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
doing bad things when you de-obscate the

591
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,280
contents of this macro you can see very

592
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
clearly they call it windows command

593
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,679
processor

594
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,760
they invoke powershell and then they use

595
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
powershell to facilitate the download of

596
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,679
the second stage payload in this case

597
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,320
which

598
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,360
was asyncrat again another rat that that

599
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
we see pretty commonly across the

600
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,440
commodity malware landscape

601
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,400
but just kind of shows uh how prolific

602
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,520
these sorts of

603
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
attacks are we're seeing a significant

604
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,720
increase in volume

605
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
of attacks that are leveraging these

606
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
platforms right they realize that they

607
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,120
can circumvent

608
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,760
defenses they realize that by leveraging

609
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,200
them they can automatically take

610
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
advantage of

611
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,679
security protections that are provided

612
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,160
by those platforms right tls encryption

613
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,960
they can they can evade a lot of the

614
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,799
conventional network-based protections

615
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,840
that many organizations may rely on

616
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
so here's an example of that async rap

617
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,919
payload retrieval you can see the get

618
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,760
request to the

619
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,240
discord cdn in this case for the actual

620
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
binary payload

621
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
and you can see the emc file header

622
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
towards the bottom of that screenshot

623
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
that's the actual async rap payload it's

624
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
executed on the system

625
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,120
and the system is infected with async

626
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,280
grab

627
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,840
so here's another example of a pdf in

628
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,240
this case it was beakmill.pdf

629
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
you open the pdf and there's a pretty

630
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
simple message the pdf

631
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
obviously loves you but on the back end

632
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
what it's trying to do is go out to

633
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,240
the discord cd and to pull down a second

634
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
stage malware payload

635
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
and if you just take a look at the even

636
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
the strings associated with this pdf you

637
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
can see exactly what it's trying to do

638
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,919
it's trying to use javascript

639
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,039
to go out and retrieve a pe32

640
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,840
that would then be executed and kick off

641
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,559
the actual

642
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,679
uh final malware infection itself so

643
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,760
we're seeing a ton of abuse of these

644
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,320
we're even seeing iot botnets leveraging

645
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
these cdns

646
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,799
for the purposes of retrieving

647
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,120
additional components that are used once

648
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
the initial

649
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,240
infection process has taken place this

650
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
is an example of the

651
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
command string um associated with a

652
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
variant of the q

653
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
by iot botnet where you can see that

654
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
they're retrieving additional content

655
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
from the discord cdn during the

656
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
infection process as well

657
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,919
so this is something that's being used

658
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,840
very widely um

659
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
the screenshots showing the the virus

660
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,679
total query that i ran

661
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,200
are a very very good starting point if

662
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,360
you're interested in getting some more

663
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
information or analyzing or digging into

664
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,080
some of these

665
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,919
these threats and seeing how they work

666
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
you can find no shortage of

667
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,320
examples of these sorts of techniques

668
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,600
being used

669
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,440
right this isn't a theoretical this

670
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
could be done this is what we're seeing

671
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
across the threat landscape pretty

672
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
heavily

673
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,559
so once the infection process is

674
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,520
complete

675
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,039
you typically will see some sort of a

676
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,600
command and control channel established

677
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,880
or you'll see some sort of data

678
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
exfiltration take place or some other

679
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
variety of post compromise activities

680
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,640
reconnaissance a lot of when we did

681
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,919
things like that

682
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,919
so how are adversaries taking advantage

683
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
of collaboration platforms that just

684
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,799
saved to the

685
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,919
infection process uh well so i mentioned

686
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
at the very very beginning of this

687
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,840
presentation that both of the platforms

688
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
that i've been focusing on slack and

689
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,120
discord

690
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
they allow automation to be

691
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,600
configured you can set up bots that do

692
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
various things

693
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,520
you can set up automated scripts that

694
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,159
interface

695
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
or interact with these platforms for a

696
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,840
variety of purposes and they typically

697
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,720
will

698
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
implement this functionality in the form

699
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,320
of what are called web hooks

700
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
and this is basically a publicly

701
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,320
available api that you can use

702
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
in your bot or you can use in your

703
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,320
script to communicate back with your

704
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,760
discord server

705
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
so you can use this for sending updates

706
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
or you know any number of

707
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
different purposes while threat actors

708
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
are leveraging it for a variety of

709
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,559
purposes

710
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,000
as well so you can see the url

711
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,559
um here you've got discord.com api web

712
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,320
hooks and then a webhook id

713
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
and this is typically an alphanumeric

714
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,919
string

715
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,120
that you can see um but at the same time

716
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,880
you know whereas uh traditional command

717
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,120
and control in a lot of cases will look

718
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,440
pretty obvious if you're looking at your

719
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
network traffic

720
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
you know from your systems your

721
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,080
monitoring systems

722
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
uh your defensive systems and

723
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
organization this

724
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,039
looks a lot like normal discord

725
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,480
communications and

726
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,240
in many organizations discord.com right

727
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
is not going to be

728
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,799
blocked at the edge so this is a very

729
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,240
attractive way that

730
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,000
adversaries can facilitate command and

731
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,520
control they can begin to operate

732
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,480
further

733
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
inside of victim environments without

734
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
drawing a lot of attention to themselves

735
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
they have inherent encryption of the

736
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
communications because again

737
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,360
it's tls and they can blend in with the

738
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
legitimate communications that may be

739
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,159
seen

740
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,080
so this is an example of you know what a

741
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,679
discord web hook looks like it's it's

742
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,159
pretty straightforward

743
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,960
it's it's pretty robust from a command

744
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,080
control perspective

745
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
uh slack supports a similar type of

746
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,159
format and uses an example of

747
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,240
you know what their uh web hook url

748
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,919
typically looks like and what the the

749
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
contents of the typical web hook may

750
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,039
look like from slack's perspective so

751
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,559
just to kind of give you some examples

752
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
of what this looks like in practice

753
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,760
so this is an example of

754
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
an initial beaconing that is taking

755
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
place following a successful infection

756
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,480
so

757
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,799
typically when you see a bot infect a

758
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,400
system one of the first things it'll do

759
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,960
is it'll

760
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,480
gather information about the system and

761
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,240
then it will report the successful

762
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,919
infection status back to the

763
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,159
threat actor and they'll typically track

764
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:44,960
metrics

765
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
they may have admin panels set up that

766
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,320
provide

767
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
you know an interface to manage the

768
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
different bots under their control

769
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,159
but that c2 channel typically starts

770
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,440
with some sort of a beaconing and

771
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,520
registration process so the infected

772
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,600
system will register itself with c2

773
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,360
it'll say hey you infected me and i'm

774
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
now available for you to you know

775
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,360
do whatever to and this is an example of

776
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,640
that you can see

777
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,000
um the the contents of the the web hook

778
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,520
um are url encoded but you can see the

779
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,440
uh the decoded format there on the right

780
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
side of the

781
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,559
slide in this particular case it was

782
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,320
that initial beacon they were

783
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,559
basically receiving alerts via discord

784
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,320
when new systems were infected that gave

785
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,640
in the name of the system as well as the

786
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,360
url to use to perform additional command

787
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,880
control in this case they were using the

788
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
portmap.ios service

789
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
and just as an aside port map is

790
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
becoming a much more popular

791
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,440
way for adversaries to obfuscate their

792
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,279
c2 infrastructure

793
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,279
and so there's various services that

794
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,520
operate very similarly ingrock is one

795
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,279
but port map is one that we've seen

796
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,200
used in a variety of different threats

797
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,799
so the way that this works

798
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,279
as the attacker's command control server

799
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
will establish an open vpn connection to

800
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,960
the port map.i o service

801
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,640
they they'll also make sure that their

802
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
malware is set up to establish a

803
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,320
connection to the portmap.io

804
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
domain as well so you've got the c2

805
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,279
server connected to port mac you've got

806
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,039
the infected victim connected support

807
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:11,840
map

808
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
so anytime the victim system attempts to

809
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
communicate

810
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,600
with the attacker server they will

811
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,279
communicate with the port map.i o

812
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,360
service which provides that translation

813
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,799
and routes the traffic back to the

814
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,360
attacker c2 server and then likewise any

815
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,840
sort of

816
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,159
interaction with invented systems takes

817
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,840
place following the same type

818
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,760
of data flow and so what this does is

819
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,440
this allows an adversary to stand up

820
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,200
command and control infrastructure

821
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,240
but from a victim perspective if you've

822
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,320
got a system that's infected on your

823
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,080
on your network and you're looking at

824
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,720
the c2 it looks like all of the c2 is

825
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
pointed towards port map if you don't

826
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
actually get any visibility into the

827
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,720
backing

828
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
infrastructure that's being used to

829
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
maintain the botnet or

830
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,760
administer the c2 channel

831
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,679
so a couple of other interesting

832
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,880
examples this was

833
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,520
a script that was written uh during the

834
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,760
infection process of a piece of windows

835
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,279
mallory so what they were doing in this

836
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:05,919
case is

837
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,080
uh they dropped a secondary payload that

838
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,279
was called discord

839
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,880
send webhook and this was just a

840
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,799
persistent uh process that they would

841
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,919
kick off that would run in the

842
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,760
background on the infected system

843
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,840
and so what they would do is uh they

844
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
would uh basically run this batch file

845
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,799
this file would be responsible for

846
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,240
executing a lot of

847
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,640
uh reconnaissance commands using the

848
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,440
windows

849
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
management instrumentation framework the

850
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,360
wmi interface within windows

851
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,200
to collect a ton of information about

852
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,039
the system they would write the results

853
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,559
of those wmi queries

854
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,480
to text files and then they would send

855
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
to the contents of those text files

856
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
inside of discord web hooks so it's a

857
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,760
pretty unique way to

858
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
implement a command and control

859
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
mechanism using nothing but

860
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,440
discord web hooks and you can kind of

861
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,200
see what this looks like

862
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,480
on the wire within in this case verb

863
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
so you can see that one of the initial

864
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,520
messages that said is a

865
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
you know currently writing the info

866
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,039
currently collecting uh wait a few

867
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,320
minutes and you'll start to receive

868
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,400
information about the infected system

869
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,360
so once that wmi has been kicked off the

870
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,919
uh

871
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,440
the reconnaissance information has been

872
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,080
collected that information is then sent

873
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,320
line by line by reading the contents of

874
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
those text files that were written

875
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,159
uh and sending it in the form of discord

876
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,760
web hooks back to the adversary you can

877
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,080
see creation class name equals win32

878
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,039
operating systems

879
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,039
that's basically just the command output

880
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,919
of the execution of those wmi commands

881
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,320
execute wmi write it out to a text file

882
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,919
read the text file line by line and

883
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,440
transmit it back to the adversaries

884
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,080
discord server

885
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,399
so just another example of in this case

886
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,480
it was a leak gap which is a paid to

887
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,520
decrypt

888
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
ransomware variant that was also

889
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,559
leveraging the

890
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,799
discord webhook api for the purposes of

891
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,000
command control

892
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,399
you can see again one of the initial

893
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,200
parts of the

894
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,679
c2 establishment process is that initial

895
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,360
beaconing and registration process where

896
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,640
they send information

897
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,159
about the infected system back to the

898
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
adversary in this case

899
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,159
it is sent back to the adversaries this

900
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,000
word server where they can log in

901
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,240
and begin to uh to administer the

902
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,720
infections that they retain

903
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,080
so in this case i mentioned it was

904
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,240
ransomware once the encryption process

905
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,440
on the victim system

906
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,919
starts and the data and files begin to

907
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,880
be encrypted

908
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,279
uh that status is then periodically sent

909
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,679
to the attackers discord server

910
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,120
so that they can keep track of their

911
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
different systems they can keep track of

912
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,320
which systems have been successfully

913
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,960
encrypted

914
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,520
and they can begin to perform some of

915
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,080
the

916
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,720
post compromise uh ransomware operations

917
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,159
um you know the extortion

918
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,720
and uh processing of any sort of random

919
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,360
payments and

920
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,919
things of that nature so in this

921
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,360
particular case once the encryption

922
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,200
process is over this is just an example

923
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,480
of one of the ransom notes that's

924
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,600
displayed for

925
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,240
this particular variant of paid tv crit

926
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,960
it's

927
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
fairly straightforward uh one of the the

928
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
interesting things is

929
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,600
that they gave a uh a timer that says

930
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
you know if you don't pay by a certain

931
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
uh time um you know you're you're

932
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
going to uh to lose access all your

933
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,399
files in a lot of cases we may see them

934
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,440
up the uh demand if that time frame

935
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,399
hasn't been met uh

936
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,320
pretty much anything adversaries can do

937
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,760
to maximize the likelihood they can

938
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,559
convince them

939
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,039
to pay out and so finally i want to talk

940
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
about token and cookie stealing

941
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,320
so in

942
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,559
both of these platforms access tokens

943
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,600
are

944
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,720
you know stored on systems so one of the

945
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,559
things that we've seen adversaries focus

946
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:28,799
on

947
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,840
is ways to steal tokens from legit

948
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,159
legitimate disorder slack users and

949
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
there's a variety of reasons they might

950
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,399
want these tokens it allows them to

951
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,159
impersonate the user access

952
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,480
all of the discord servers and all of

953
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,679
the slack

954
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,760
workspaces that the user is an

955
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,440
authorized part of

956
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,399
it allows them to pose as that user so

957
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,039
this may

958
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,120
maximize the number of potential victims

959
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,240
that they can

960
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,720
convince to open malicious files

961
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,320
download malicious content things like

962
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,760
that if you get a message from somebody

963
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,440
that you know and trust

964
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
your you may be more likely to open it

965
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
and kick off the initial infection

966
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
process

967
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
one of the things that we noticed when

968
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,600
we were doing this analysis was that at

969
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,640
the time that the

970
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,399
that we performed this research there

971
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,640
was no client verification performed so

972
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,520
if you had this

973
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
access token from either slack or

974
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,720
discord or if you had the

975
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,760
cookie you could impersonate users and

976
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,120
you can use that for a variety of

977
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,760
different

978
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,960
and various purposes so

979
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,880
one of the things that we've that we've

980
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,399
noticed is that a lot of the token

981
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,760
stealing applications

982
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,679
often pose as game sheets or cracks or

983
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,320
key chins you know takes takes me back a

984
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,360
little ways

985
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
but you can see an example of this with

986
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,919
a main craft gin which was posing as

987
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,799
uh being a crack associated with the

988
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,640
minecraft game that's that's pretty

989
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,080
popular among

990
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,640
kids nowadays so here's the main

991
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
function of main crack gin where they

992
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,000
define the web hook that they're going

993
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,919
to use to transmit exfiltrated

994
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:58,880
information

995
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
back to the thread actor you can see

996
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,000
they include a lot of different

997
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,600
information that they're able to obtain

998
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,640
as well as the

999
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,559
token um here's an example of

1000
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,480
you know then doing that data gathering

1001
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,640
so once they're executing on a system

1002
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,159
they didn't execute this code

1003
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,000
that pulls a lot of information about

1004
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
the victim

1005
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
so that it can be transmitted back to

1006
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,880
the adversary and you can kind of see

1007
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,519
them sending the token in this case

1008
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,360
another example is with a growtopia

1009
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,200
themed uh steeler

1010
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,559
the sealer was posing as being a

1011
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,559
crack associated with or a gin

1012
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,840
associated with the

1013
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,880
with growtopia where the entire purpose

1014
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,559
of the application was stealing

1015
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,279
the discord token as well as uh

1016
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,799
additional information about the system

1017
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,519
that

1018
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,279
isn't useful to adversaries they can

1019
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,120
maintain anonymity they can pose

1020
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,000
as victims and they can try to leverage

1021
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
that access to

1022
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
further compromise individuals and

1023
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,919
organizations that way

1024
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,679
so stealing slack cookies is a little

1025
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,360
more complicated but not by

1026
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,120
much and a lot of what we've seen is

1027
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,519
targeting the browser cookie the the d

1028
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,600
cookie client cookies are stored in the

1029
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,360
sqlite database so if you've got code

1030
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
execution on a system because you've

1031
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
that initial delivery stage has has

1032
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,519
worked and you've got code execution

1033
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,360
because they opened a file they executed

1034
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,519
some macros or something of that nature

1035
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,519
it's pretty trivial to be able to to

1036
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,039
pull these tokens

1037
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,960
and then adversaries can leverage those

1038
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,399
for additional

1039
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,000
purposes so if you're interested in that

1040
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
there's a tool out there called slack

1041
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,399
pirate

1042
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
um this is a slack enumeration and an

1043
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
extraction tool that you can use to

1044
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,600
uh test that process out uh and kind of

1045
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,559
see how easy it is for an adversary to

1046
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,200
take advantage of that functionality to

1047
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,320
steal tokens

1048
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
and you can imagine what every adversary

1049
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,840
can do

1050
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,919
if they're able to obtain a slack token

1051
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,840
for a user in your organization's

1052
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,640
workspace

1053
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,039
they can then leverage that access to

1054
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,880
perform additional social engineering

1055
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,679
and that sort of thing so as far as

1056
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,440
business protections and some things

1057
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
that organizations can do a lot of the

1058
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,919
same

1059
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,880
uh technical and administrative defenses

1060
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,320
that we've been recommending for a long

1061
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,880
time

1062
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,039
are pretty effective so making sure that

1063
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,799
you have a comprehensive remote access

1064
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,000
policy that you're

1065
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,399
making users aware that just because you

1066
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,200
know they

1067
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,039
receive something in discord or slack

1068
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,399
doesn't mean that it's necessarily

1069
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,840
benign a lot of people

1070
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,399
think that there's a super comprehensive

1071
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,120
content inspection taking place but

1072
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,960
we found that it was pretty trivial for

1073
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,320
payloads to

1074
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,080
be stored on these content delivery

1075
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,760
networks without a significant

1076
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,840
percentage of them being either taken

1077
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,080
down or detected as malicious so uh

1078
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,200
something to

1079
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,120
be aware of i mentioned this a couple

1080
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,559
times but the use of the

1081
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,679
tls the compression algorithms

1082
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,559
and a couple of the other

1083
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,200
characteristics of this abuse make it

1084
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,559
may make it difficult for some

1085
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,480
organizations to detect

1086
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
and also be able to inspect the contents

1087
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
of these communications right they all

1088
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,039
look like they're

1089
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,519
uh you know legitimate cen

1090
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,880
communications they all look like

1091
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,360
legitimate communications with platforms

1092
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,120
like discord and slack

1093
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,039
they look very the exact same in a lot

1094
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,480
of cases to

1095
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,879
benign communications that that you may

1096
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,560
see in logs

1097
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,918
but the reality is there may be

1098
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,239
malicious activity taking place

1099
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,639
so here's just a snapshot of a lot of

1100
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,239
the different security controls that

1101
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,359
organizations should

1102
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,918
uh really consider when uh trying to

1103
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,599
defend against these sort of attacks

1104
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,079
right

1105
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,040
um there's preventative security

1106
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,839
controls

1107
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,839
um that should be implemented to try to

1108
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,639
avoid you know this sort of attack

1109
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,800
being successful in your environment um

1110
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,679
if you don't

1111
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,560
use discord or slack for legitimate

1112
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
business purposes

1113
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,679
consider you know not allowing

1114
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,199
communications with those platforms to

1115
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,879
take place on your network

1116
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,399
make sure that you're inspecting the

1117
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,159
contents of those communications

1118
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,320
and if you're unable to perform network

1119
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,239
based detection and analysis

1120
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,520
uh you know make sure that you have

1121
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,440
comprehensive endpoint security controls

1122
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,800
deployed so that

1123
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
you're able to successfully disrupt the

1124
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,000
infection process

1125
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,560
even if it does get to an end point so

1126
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,880
these security controls typically

1127
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
build upon each other right that's that

1128
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,359
defense in-depth security strategy that

1129
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,680
you know we always recommend where you

1130
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,599
have a comprehensive set of security

1131
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,040
controls that work together

1132
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,599
to maximize the effectiveness of the

1133
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,119
security controls that you have in your

1134
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,960
environment in the case that you cannot

1135
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
prevent

1136
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,359
these sorts of attacks make sure that

1137
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,040
you have security controls in place to

1138
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
detect them and

1139
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,920
be able to respond to them if they're

1140
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,560
encountered in your environment

1141
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,040
so shameless plug i am a security

1142
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,200
researcher i work for cisco talos

1143
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
one of the things that we always try to

1144
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,800
do whenever possible is to provide as

1145
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
much information to

1146
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
the security industry about what we're

1147
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
seeing from a threatman today

1148
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,480
perspective

1149
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,079
and what sort of attacks are we seeing

1150
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,520
we try to share as much of that as

1151
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,240
possible

1152
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,680
to help raise the bar for the entire

1153
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,280
community so there's a lot of resources

1154
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,160
that you can use

1155
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,240
to stay up to date on some of the latest

1156
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,680
threats that we're seeing

1157
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,119
some of the analysis that we're

1158
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,960
releasing on a regular basis so i highly

1159
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,000
encourage you to

1160
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
check out those resources and with that

1161
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,839
thanks everyone for having me i hope

1162
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:12,640
this was helpful

1163
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,170
[Applause]

1164
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,079
we have our camera turned off right now

1165
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,680
but uh i'd love to spend

1166
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
at least a couple weeks with you doing

1167
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,800
some of this stuff man that was that was

1168
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,720
incredible that's that's awesome

1169
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,560
uh and that fits right in line with what

1170
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,320
we were talking about throughout the

1171
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
conference today uh watching some of

1172
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,440
that stuff

1173
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,359
and here i use this board all through

1174
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,359
the cobia

1175
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,839
timeline you know doing all various

1176
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,520
different types of training and learning

1177
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,000
and

1178
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
just clicking on those links because

1179
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,880
they say yeah go ahead click on this

1180
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,119
here's the information that you need and

1181
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,800
lo and behold i probably could have

1182
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,480
maybe did download something you know

1183
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,560
but i think back then they were still

1184
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
you know a little bit before the spike

1185
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,680
that you showed in your graphic you know

1186
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,440
timeline and stuff like that but man

1187
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
that's amazing it's it's incredible so

1188
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,760
uh we're going to open up here

1189
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,160
uh to questions in the audience do we

1190
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,079
have any online did you did you get any

1191
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,000
see any raised hands down online

1192
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
or anything like that negative negative

1193
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,920
okay so we got any ques oh we got one up

1194
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,280
here go ahead matt

1195
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,480
how do you want to come up here and

1196
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,800
i've been curious if you'd seen any uh

1197
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,839
malware

1198
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,920
targeting microsoft teams platform

1199
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
uh so in this particular case the uh the

1200
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,119
majority of what we saw was actually

1201
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,400
targeting discord

1202
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,480
uh we saw uh we saw now we're targeting

1203
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,680
slack as well but there was

1204
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,359
significantly less of that

1205
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,079
um again this was uh we released our

1206
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,760
initial research in april

1207
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,680
um so i imagine that would change over

1208
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,839
time but i think these two platforms

1209
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,079
are kind of considered or the most

1210
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,920
commonly known as being the most popular

1211
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,400
so

1212
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,760
those are the platforms that we've seen

1213
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,440
kind of targeted by adversary so far

1214
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,040
thank you yeah that was interesting

1215
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,320
that's a good question because i know

1216
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,000
we use teams a lot a lot of people use

1217
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,520
teams in addition to

1218
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,560
discord and some of the other ones uh uh

1219
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,640
i know this score was real popular with

1220
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:08,960
the

1221
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
uh cyber security community throughout

1222
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
the the coveted time frame

1223
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,240
so do we have other yes

1224
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,440
can they learn anything from microsoft

1225
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,680
teams

1226
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,000
can they learn anything from microsoft

1227
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
teams that can help solve this problem

1228
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,040
uh so i'm not super familiar with

1229
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,320
microsoft teams

1230
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
um the majority of the research that

1231
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,520
i've done on these

1232
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,960
collaboration platforms has been

1233
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,480
specific to kind of the threats that

1234
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,760
we've seen

1235
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,119
which again pretty much uh targeted

1236
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,400
a discord in slack

1237
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,280
okay oh another one i would think the

1238
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,800
bulk of that would probably be in those

1239
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,240
aspects since

1240
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,280
slack and discord are open and anonymous

1241
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,839
where microsoft teams requires an

1242
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,320
account

1243
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,440
based or did you catch that

1244
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,839
uh no the the sound quality is not yeah

1245
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,440
well i didn't take the microphone up to

1246
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,920
him so

1247
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,160
he was basically saying that uh discord

1248
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,280
and slack are

1249
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,200
anonymous types of platforms a lot of

1250
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
times where teams is

1251
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,480
you know you're registered and you're a

1252
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,880
well-known entity on teams and

1253
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,560
so that could have some of that as well

1254
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960
to affect some of that stuff

1255
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
yeah and i think that's one of the

1256
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
things that adversaries have found

1257
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
attractive specifically about

1258
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,440
platforms like discord is that you know

1259
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,040
anyone can register an account

1260
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,359
anyone can stand up their own server you

1261
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,800
know there's there's no

1262
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,520
um there's no real barrier to entry

1263
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
there whereas some other platforms

1264
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
um you know the barrier to entry is

1265
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,119
significantly higher and it makes it

1266
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,640
less attractive for

1267
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
a lot of these adversaries that are

1268
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
looking to uh to generate revenue

1269
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,760
yeah i thought that they had uh

1270
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,920
with the with microsoft teams that

1271
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,359
they'd open that up

1272
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,760
to anyone to get an account and the

1273
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
other thing i do know with microsoft

1274
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,240
teams

1275
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,079
is that if you have the right if you

1276
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,280
have a url

1277
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,560
you can send a webhook

1278
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,000
message to the url import without

1279
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,880
being authenticated

1280
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,599
did we lose them

1281
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,960
no i just stopped talking oh no uh

1282
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
he's there he's there okay oh yeah yeah

1283
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
i'm here i'm sorry

1284
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
was there a question i think he was just

1285
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,800
making a statement that

1286
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,119
microsoft teams you know provides links

1287
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,440
uh and then you could it was uh what do

1288
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,880
you say what book

1289
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,240
um they share out so uh

1290
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,160
you know that's another means of doing

1291
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,640
something some of that stuff

1292
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,119
yeah and i i mean i you know i mean full

1293
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,720
disclosure if you if you look at

1294
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,040
platforms that are used for cloud

1295
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
storage for content delivery

1296
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,720
um you know this isn't a problem that's

1297
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,880
restricted to slack and discord

1298
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,160
uh this is just kind of what i was

1299
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,000
focusing on for for this particular

1300
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,760
presentation in this specific research

1301
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,720
blog but we see

1302
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,560
other platforms of use pretty commonly

1303
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,400
you know google drive dropbox things

1304
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,200
like that so

1305
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,920
anytime adversaries are able to identify

1306
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,160
legitimate platforms that are trusted by

1307
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,480
victim organizations that they can use

1308
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,079
to take advantage of

1309
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,839
and inherit trust with the contents that

1310
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,680
are delivered via those platforms

1311
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,800
they're going to yes yeah definitely all

1312
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,359
right well

1313
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,440
uh any other questions here from the

1314
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,880
audience help

1315
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,119
one more yes was there a specific

1316
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,680
platform like windows or mac or

1317
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,319
or was the the wrap generic enough that

1318
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:38,800
it would

1319
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,359
download content based on that yeah so

1320
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:41,920
was the

1321
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,000
was there a specific platform windows

1322
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,280
linux uh

1323
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,880
for the rack that was used for

1324
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,480
windows windows that is your question

1325
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
yeah so windows was mandated with the

1326
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,319
target os

1327
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,160
okay all right uh so i think dale's

1328
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,839
going to turn on the camera briefly for

1329
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:02,960
you

1330
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,280
so we have a gift for you uh just make

1331
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,359
sure you give me your address

1332
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,000
so we can send that out to you you're

1333
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,280
going to miss out we're going to go

1334
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,400
get some cake so you missed pizza

1335
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,960
and some other food earlier uh we wish

1336
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,920
we could have had you here

1337
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,240
live i would love to pick your brain a

1338
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,160
whole lot more on a lot of this stuff

1339
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,560
i might be hitting you up uh on on the

1340
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,079
uh on the outside of this when we're

1341
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,839
done with the conference uh

1342
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,240
this stuff is very very fascinating to

1343
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,040
me uh

1344
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,640
be interesting i'd love to spend like i

1345
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,160
said a couple weeks with you doing this

1346
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,359
stuff so

1347
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,720
i'm sure there's probably many others

1348
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,560
here too that would be a little bit

1349
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,680
close to do that stuff

1350
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,839
so again appreciate it thank you so much

1351
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:42,880
for your time

1352
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
thank you uh this is this is really

1353
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,920
enlightening

1354
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,119
