1
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,880
oh

2
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,599
the red light goes out okay can you hear

3
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,479
me

4
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,959
not yet

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
it says it's on but there's no light

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,840
are we are we long batteries maybe

7
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
let's try this and i'm gonna leave this

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:26,560
up okay okay we got a good red light

9
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,280
okay you can hear me okay

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
all right so our next presenter is going

11
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
to be penelope

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
uh she's got her title is code hedgehogs

13
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,360
changing the s

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
and sldc to secure as opposed to

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
software development life cycle or

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,159
systems development lifecycle

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,119
and so basically she we're going to try

18
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:51,759
she's going to

19
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,640
talk about software secure software

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,280
development

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,680
using a shift-left effort and aiming to

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,520
identify security vulnerabilities early

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,439
in the development life cycle

24
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,960
so takeaways from this talk will be

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
ideas on how to engage developers

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
in shifting the security posture of the

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,360
organization through secure coding with

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
a simple analogy

29
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
concrete steps at each phase of the sdlc

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
and fund ways to learn how to do it

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,480
a quick review on how to enter

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
integrate secure coding at each step of

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,480
the software development life cycle

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
and then discuss top application

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,760
vulnerabilities and mitigation

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
techniques to defend against known

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
attacks

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
and then there's three different

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
approaches to threat modeling

40
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
and wrapping up with recommendations on

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,959
how to try your hand on the other side

42
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,519
of

43
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,519
gamified red team challenges where

44
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,800
coding skills

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
give you a decided advantage penelope is

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,200
an experienced

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,040
cyber security professional and a

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,519
learner and passionate

49
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,760
about all things cyber she has two

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,800
bachelor's degrees

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
i didn't i was going to ask you what

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
were they previously in so

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
the first one's called political economy

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
of industrial society

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
okay peis and then the other was

56
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,800
i was a k-12 k-12 by the way and now a

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,519
master's

58
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,319
in as well as a masters and now a degree

59
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,080
in cyber security and information

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
assurance

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
very good so she's an actor she is

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,040
active in the black hills information

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,879
security community

64
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,200
uh speaking are you going to planning to

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
go to deadwood

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
deadwood yep okay so there you go she's

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
going to give a presentation out of

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
a presentation or just attending

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
volunteering volunteering there so

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,239
um active so active with black hills

71
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,000
information security community

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,720
and appointed friends of bhis uh

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,920
designation

74
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,040
not only known as the nerd herders

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
not familiar with that one so all right

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
uh you might even stumble upon cameo

77
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,319
appearances on the newscast of

78
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,640
backdoors and breaches demos found on

79
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
youtube or twitch

80
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
she's an educator at heart excited to

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
share her expertise and

82
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,879
audiences whenever given the opportunity

83
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,439
nlp also has her comptia security plus

84
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,840
and cysa plus certs

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,640
and uh an adjunct instructor at northern

86
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,839
kentucky university

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,040
in the gen cyber program so welcome and

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,360
uh

89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
the floor is yours

90
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,280
hopefully i can keep you entertained

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,440
long enough to uh

92
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
okay well i was expecting 30 minutes so

93
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
let's see how this goes

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
so you may have noticed he did not say

95
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,639
my last name because it is roshkova

96
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,240
and when people see it they are just

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
like i don't know what to do with that

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
exactly and um so i married

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
russian and uh i've learned a little bit

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
about the

101
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
russian culture and in russian the word

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
anecdote kind of means what

103
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
it means in english but it is more like

104
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,840
what we use for

105
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,919
like to tell a joke and so that's

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,080
actually what i want to start with today

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
and give you some insight into why i

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,360
said

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
uh code hedgehogs and so this

110
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:24,639
uh let's see if we go here

111
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
because the light is let's see

112
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
okay

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
yep i know we tested it before i started

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,840
to talk

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
it's not just me

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,600
all right so let's see

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,960
yeah so like that pointer's working

118
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
so it'll go backwards oh there it is

119
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,039
okay there's four all right so

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,039
apparently all right so

121
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
my russian anecdote so there's this

122
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
group of mice who are

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,199
chatting among themselves and they say

124
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,960
to them they're talking about like how

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
they have this terrible position in life

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,919
they are at the um bottom of the food

127
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,560
chain

128
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
they don't like being there anymore what

129
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,400
can we do about this problem that we

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
have about being at the bottom of the

131
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,960
food chain

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
and they're just like we can't figure it

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
out but i bet you that wise owl

134
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,880
can give us an idea so the mice head

135
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
over to the owl and they asked the owl

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,199
and they

137
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,960
explained their situation about how they

138
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
don't like being at the bottom of the

139
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,120
food chain

140
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
and what can we do to make ourselves um

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,919
less vulnerable and they uh the

142
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,039
owl says that's a good question

143
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,680
let me think about that for a minute and

144
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
the

145
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
owl says i've got it you can become a

146
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
hedgehog

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,759
and the mice are like oh that's a great

148
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,360
idea isn't it we have

149
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,080
uh quills if we're hedgehogs and we can

150
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
roll up in that ball

151
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
and you know we're not going to be as

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
easily to be grabbed by those mouths

153
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,039
because our quills will like protect us

154
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
that's a great idea let's become

155
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,479
hedgehogs and so they

156
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,240
walk off and they're so excited and

157
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
they're just like oh my gosh i want to

158
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,960
be a hedgehog

159
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
let's do it let's do it and they stop

160
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,479
there's like wait a minute he didn't

161
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,680
tell us how

162
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,919
how are we supposed to be hedgehogs and

163
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,840
so they're like okay well we let's go

164
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,800
back and ask him

165
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
and they go back to the owl and he's

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
just like yeah of course i didn't tell

167
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,840
you how to be hedgehogs you know like

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
i'm the idea guy

169
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,280
you go figure out how to be a hedgehog

170
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
so you know the owl gave them a great

171
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
idea but then they didn't know what to

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,440
do with it

173
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,879
so that's kind of where we are with

174
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
um programmers today right programmers

175
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
um

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
kind of can be the mice in the cyber

177
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,759
security

178
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,479
vulnerability space right they are who

179
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,360
they are

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,759
and sometimes don't see the reason to

181
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,160
have quills

182
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,440
see please yes okay

183
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,879
so um this talk hopefully as

184
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,560
uh carl said in the introduction will

185
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
give you some ideas about how to shift

186
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
your security posture

187
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
and give you some talking points for

188
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
when you're dealing with developers who

189
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,919
kind of say well we don't need to be

190
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
hedgehogs

191
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
so when we have the secure development

192
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
life cycle whether it's waterfall or

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
agile

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,599
um generally speaking the security

195
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,159
starts

196
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
at the testing level right so um

197
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,839
they have not been thinking with the

198
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,159
secure

199
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,039
posture in mind as they get started and

200
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
when we get to testing and doing quality

201
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
assurance that's when it starts to

202
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
happen

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,680
and so we get the dynamic analysis with

204
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,040
the tools that are in place and

205
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
hopefully the tools work

206
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,880
and you might have some pen testers come

207
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
in and

208
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,040
test it at that point but the new idea

209
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
in this area is to shift left

210
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,519
and one of the people i'm going to talk

211
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,279
about later says push left right because

212
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,880
it depends on the environment of whether

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,920
they're willingly

214
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,519
going to go to the left or if they're

215
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
going to have to be

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,640
encouraged to move but we can start

217
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,279
at the beginning and we can look at our

218
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,279
documentation that we have in place that

219
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,519
is probably in your risk in governance

220
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
and figure out how to start this project

221
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,240
with the planning to begin with

222
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
and you can go all the way through the

223
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,760
life cycle by adding in

224
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
relevant steps along the whole process

225
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,320
that are encourage a secure posture

226
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,839
and so that by the time you get to that

227
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,480
testing

228
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
that quality assurance level you've

229
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
already been thinking about it

230
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,560
and the thing is when you start early

231
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
then it's more cost effective

232
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,760
both in terms of time and money

233
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
and then you can move on and make sure

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
that it doesn't just stop at testing

235
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
but it is also included in the other

236
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
steps where you're going to have you

237
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,079
know when you're in deployment and you

238
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,000
have the final security review

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
you can create that incident response

240
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,480
plan and hopefully based on what you've

241
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,079
been doing through the previous steps

242
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,399
have it built in there

243
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,959
and then the maintenance part of course

244
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,440
as well

245
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,880
to have your developers in mind of like

246
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,959
oh these are kind of the things that

247
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,519
are out there and if the new ones come

248
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,800
up it's not going to be

249
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
news to them about how this process is

250
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,040
working

251
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,680
so along the whole way you want to keep

252
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
in your mind

253
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,600
like the threat modeling process and

254
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
adjusting your priorities and risk

255
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,839
reduction

256
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
strategies as you move along so it can

257
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,279
be a much more dynamic process

258
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
so where do we start right so if the

259
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
developers like never really had this

260
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
education

261
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
when i gave this talk to like a group of

262
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,880
students who came

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
up through tech elevator and they said

264
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
oh we only got one day on security

265
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,320
and so you know it's a 14-week program

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,519
it goes fast they don't

267
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,600
necessarily know what that means to

268
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
secure to code securely

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,079
so you know start you know start with

270
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,760
something that's out there

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
well established and if you look at

272
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
these top ten

273
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,880
like nine of them are things that

274
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
developers can help with right like the

275
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
insufficient login and monitoring is

276
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
like the only one that is not

277
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,200
kind of in the programmer's wheelhouse

278
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,720
and you can introduce them to the

279
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,959
website you know you can take them there

280
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,680
and you know pick something to show them

281
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,000
off

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,920
your list and take them through the page

283
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,360
so um and if you're in a dynamic

284
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,079
situation

285
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,320
i was not going to challenge the demo

286
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
gods

287
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,639
and try and do anything live

288
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,800
but it breaks it down so it gives you

289
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
across the top the thread agents and

290
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,000
attack vectors for broken authentication

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
it gives you the security

292
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
weaknesses and the impacts of having

293
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,800
broken authentication

294
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
if it's not something that's in the

295
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
forefront of their minds

296
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
um then it breaks it down in the next

297
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
four blocks right so for

298
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
all of these vulnerabilities there's a

299
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
page like this that it was

300
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,600
you all may already know that but

301
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,959
programmers probably don't

302
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
and you hear a lot of things from

303
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,120
programmers well um i use an obscure

304
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
code

305
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
um i don't need to worry about that um

306
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
you know it's it's third party it

307
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,519
doesn't really touch anything important

308
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,519
i don't need to worry about that so if

309
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
you focus on what you think is likely to

310
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,880
happen

311
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,839
um you're probably gonna get um cause

312
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,720
problems for your security team

313
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
but if you instead focus on what can

314
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,760
happen

315
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
and be prepared and if you start with

316
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,279
that process as i said from the

317
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,959
beginning with that in mind

318
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,480
like we don't know what's going to

319
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
happen we don't know who's out there who

320
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,639
wants to

321
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,240
attack us then we need to think about

322
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,279
what can happen

323
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,880
and not what's likely to happen

324
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
so the most common vulnerabilities

325
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
exploited during

326
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,920
pen testing are here um

327
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
so i am i got into

328
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,079
cyber security because i was coaching my

329
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,560
son's cyber patriot team

330
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
oh

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
okay so i uh

332
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
so cyber patriot blue team i love blue

333
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
team i like being on

334
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
uh on that side of it and he

335
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
when we first started the team we went

336
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,440
my first event was b site cincinnati in

337
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,839
2018

338
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
and i played the ctf there and i just

339
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,279
fell in love

340
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,839
with cyber security and so that's how i

341
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,040
moved from

342
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,440
education into cyber because i when i

343
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
my my new choice my son decided i was a

344
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,279
homeschooler and my son decided to go

345
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,720
back to brick and mortar i was like what

346
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,079
am i going to be when i grow up now i

347
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,199
get to choose

348
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,040
and this was like the automatic thing

349
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,240
for me because

350
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
i just love it all i and i love the

351
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
gamification

352
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
and so uh i

353
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,560
am not a coder one of the first things

354
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,160
that i learned in my program was that

355
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
coding can be really important in cyber

356
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,760
security right like

357
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
high school so i'm kind of the same age

358
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,120
as phil and and

359
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,120
uh dr c here we had trs 80s

360
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,519
in my high school lab i learned to code

361
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,399
basic

362
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,320
a little bit of fortran cobalt and

363
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,079
pascal which i don't think any of that

364
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,760
is used to get uh used today

365
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
and it was so long ago it's not like i

366
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,600
remember how to code

367
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,120
but you know i've had some fun with

368
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,279
python now and

369
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,320
i took a little java so i can play with

370
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
code i can

371
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,519
use it when i'm playing my games enough

372
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,040
to like figure out how to break it

373
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,440
and so that's me right i am

374
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,240
if you do not have input validation in

375
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,160
your code

376
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,399
i can figure that part out right so

377
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,480
that's like the easy one i think to kind

378
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
of start teaching

379
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
your programmers that that's important

380
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,279
right

381
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,959
um let's see if this works here

382
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,560
can we push play on that i don't know if

383
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,518
i can do that from here

384
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,639
to the square you guess where that goes

385
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,519
square

386
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,000
that's right

387
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,880
and how about this rectangle

388
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
it was working

389
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,160
a cylinder i think that goes in

390
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:23,839
the square hole

391
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,580
[Applause]

392
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,839
that's right

393
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,279
i know how to do that i don't know how

394
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,160
to code

395
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
but i could like figure out what to put

396
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,880
into those forms when i'm on a web app

397
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,279
and like figure out how to break in i

398
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,639
don't i'm still at the point where i

399
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,600
don't necessarily know

400
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,759
what to do on the other side but i can

401
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,390
like get some access

402
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,520
[Laughter]

403
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,480
so um i think this is like a great thing

404
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
to show your coders right like

405
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,319
what are the people on the outside gonna

406
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,000
do when you

407
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,880
you put a form out on your web app and

408
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,760
you didn't do

409
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,199
what input validation because you're

410
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
like oh they know how to read directions

411
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,599
it says to put this in right right well

412
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,959
maybe the regular user

413
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,319
is going to put things where you want to

414
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,840
but your pen tester is not going to do

415
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,320
that

416
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,600
your script kitties aren't going to do

417
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
that and um

418
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,600
it's not secure right and if it's

419
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
someone more malicious than that you

420
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,400
definitely don't want them going in that

421
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,240
way

422
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,080
so um again so preventing the

423
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
sql injections there's like a bunch of

424
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
stuff here that there are probably

425
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
people in this room

426
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,400
who know exactly how to do all those

427
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
things but i know that the one thing

428
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
that can stop me

429
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,559
as a new person is validate every user

430
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,520
input

431
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,880
and i think that's a great place to

432
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
start and i think this is like a place

433
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,440
where you can

434
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
show programmers that it's important to

435
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
improve your security posture

436
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,400
you can also introduce them to um

437
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,520
miter so my

438
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
college program didn't teach me about

439
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
mitre i did it as a special project

440
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,160
in my program right but if even cyber

441
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,919
security professionals in a

442
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,120
a good program you know my i was in a in

443
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,080
a cy

444
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,600
ah see sorry

445
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,880
anyway the nsa approved uh education

446
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,440
program

447
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
right mitre never came up in a single

448
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,679
one of my classes and i kept

449
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,440
coming to these events right and i would

450
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
hear about it and i was just like so

451
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,919
i want to thank you out here who have

452
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,799
been doing it

453
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,520
for teaching me what i wasn't learning

454
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,480
at school and

455
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
i learned about mitre by coming to these

456
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
talks right so

457
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,520
if i'm not learning it in a cyber

458
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
security program that's approved by the

459
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
nsa

460
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,120
your your programmers probably aren't so

461
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
you could introduce it to them and you

462
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
can say look these are things that can

463
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,720
happen

464
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
you know introduced during uh the design

465
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,840
phase or these are the things that are

466
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,880
introduced during implementation

467
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,799
or if they're taught a specific code and

468
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,400
you can send them and say like these are

469
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,200
the

470
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
vulnerabilities that might be there if

471
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,480
you're using

472
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
c or java or php right there's a lot of

473
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,080
php

474
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,120
out there and so you have a way

475
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,799
to introduce them to things that they

476
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
might not have been thinking about in my

477
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,080
experience when i've talked to

478
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,760
like those tech elevator people it's not

479
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,120
that they're not interested it's just

480
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,919
like oh

481
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,160
we didn't know so let's know

482
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
and if we know we can get them on the

483
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,440
path to

484
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
being able to code hedgehogs instead of

485
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,000
mice right because if we have mice

486
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,679
it's going to be really hard to turn

487
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,039
those web apps that you've

488
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
created ignoring the first four steps

489
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,919
ignoring what vulnerabilities are out

490
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,160
there and then expect them to make

491
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,120
hedgehogs

492
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,880
at the end so you can introduce them to

493
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
the idea of threat modeling

494
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840
my favorite uh explanation of like the

495
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,919
vulnerability versus threat

496
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
uh explanation because you know i'd go

497
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,440
had

498
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,960
lots of that for sure in my classes

499
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
right but a very simple way

500
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
to help keep it clear in your head for

501
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
me is

502
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
the threat is from the outside the

503
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,559
threat is the thing that is

504
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,799
outside of the system and the

505
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,200
vulnerability is the weakness within

506
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
and then risk is the intersection of the

507
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
two so i think when people can

508
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
look at it from that way without all the

509
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,039
long explanations of

510
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,960
oh these are this is a threat blah blah

511
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,240
blah i can't even remember what those

512
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,360
classroom ones were

513
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,080
but i know it was a lot of words

514
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
but that has really helped me when i

515
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
learned when i first heard that

516
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
explanations just like oh it's suddenly

517
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,480
clear

518
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
so let's make it as simple as possible

519
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
for them to kind of understand

520
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
what are the things we're looking at so

521
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,360
then we know what our you know hopefully

522
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,880
we have some ideas from the things that

523
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,159
we just discussed what some of the

524
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,520
vulnerabilities the

525
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
internal things are that could be

526
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,280
weaknesses of what we are

527
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,400
uh coding and then let's give them some

528
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,559
insight into what the threat model

529
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,080
i mean what the threats could be so it

530
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
could be attacker-centric right

531
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,120
do you work somewhere where um uh

532
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,440
industrial espionage can be a problem do

533
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
you work somewhere that you're somewhere

534
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
in the supply line

535
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
that it could be like you know classic

536
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,440
espionage that

537
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
they might want to use your third party

538
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
to access

539
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,880
something that's a little more uh

540
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
classified or

541
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,320
up the uh international food chain

542
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,080
software centric again so we talked

543
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
about like what are the platforms what

544
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,679
are the components of this

545
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,159
of the um application that you're

546
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:46,960
building

547
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,280
and have a sense of like what are the

548
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,000
weaknesses

549
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
in your components

550
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,720
and then asset centric do you have pii

551
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,320
in there that people want to get access

552
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,799
to

553
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,440
do you have state secrets that you know

554
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
somewhere down the food chain

555
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
like that you could get access to and so

556
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,080
giving them a sense of like these are

557
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,679
the thoughts that are going through the

558
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,520
attacker's minds and what

559
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
comes up to the surface for what you are

560
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,440
creating

561
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,440
so it gives them the background

562
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
to understand that you know how do i

563
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,640
identify

564
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
the known vulnerabilities the threats um

565
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,640
how do i understand these risks and then

566
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
they can go on and like start deciding

567
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
like what security controls besides

568
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,600
input validation

569
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,640
right which should just be automatic

570
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,559
that they should put into place how do

571
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,880
you prioritize those risks within your

572
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,720
organization right that's not just you

573
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,120
know

574
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,440
the conversations kind of like what um

575
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
micah was talking about i

576
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
i don't know if um uh

577
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,280
dr c like knew what i was gonna really

578
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
be talking about

579
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,159
because i just sent him my slides but he

580
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,080
i love serendipity right

581
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
just like oh my gosh like my talk i

582
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,760
think it's gonna make so much more sense

583
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,360
coming after mike i could not have

584
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,559
planned this better

585
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,760
uh thank you so much and he was blessed

586
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,000
right

587
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,440
he had somebody in his organization um

588
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,480
who was a security person who had um

589
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,880
that

590
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,320
web app background um one of my

591
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,440
uh compatriots who

592
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,159
uh is a strong technical cyber security

593
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,039
person

594
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,760
took his uh took a job recently and he's

595
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,679
been there a month and he's like

596
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,919
not like loving it you know and he's

597
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,679
just like couldn't you have done this

598
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,280
talk a month ago because if you would

599
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,880
have been talking about the fact that

600
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,000
to be a really great web app

601
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
security person you should probably have

602
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,120
had some development experience first

603
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,279
you know before you try to be that

604
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,159
person

605
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,320
and he's a great technical cyber

606
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
security person but

607
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,080
he's not a he's not a developer and he's

608
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,600
struggling so i mean

609
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
building up our developers i think for

610
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
our need in cyber security

611
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,320
to get those people already coming in

612
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,559
with a

613
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,000
secure posture mindset will give

614
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
us a pipeline to bring in better cyber

615
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,480
security people for that outside

616
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,320
so um and if you have

617
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,080
those people who already understand the

618
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,840
development side and we train them in

619
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,760
the cyber security side

620
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,480
the priority prioritizing risk and

621
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,400
creating a risk reduction

622
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,000
strategy are going to be a lot um well

623
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,520
they're not going to be easy ever right

624
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
but hopefully

625
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,279
a little smoother

626
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,559
so um the considerations we want to take

627
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
into effect are you know the

628
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
technologies leveraged by the

629
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
application the client client-side

630
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,039
databases that people might want to be

631
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,679
trying to

632
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,039
uh get gain access to rest

633
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,039
the native programming languages of the

634
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,880
app and the integrations again

635
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,400
what third parties are going to be

636
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
attaching to us

637
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,760
and then we want to look at the the

638
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,520
risks that are non-technical a lot

639
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
the loss in terms of time if you have to

640
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,120
rewrite

641
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,159
it to make it secure the loss

642
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,240
of um from a branding standpoint or a

643
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,679
reputation standpoint

644
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,720
if something goes wrong we have the

645
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,000
theft that we talked about which could

646
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,520
be the monetary or it could be the

647
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,240
information

648
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,919
whether it's secrets or personal

649
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,960
uh the pii and then again the delays

650
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,440
right it's going to be a lot easier to

651
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,320
move

652
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
uh through the development process and

653
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,720
build it in than it is if you have to go

654
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,760
back and try

655
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,279
and turn your mouse into a hedgehog

656
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,039
so i think you know

657
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
from a business standpoint it makes

658
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
sense to train these people early on

659
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,320
to have security built in

660
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,520
so then again the house right how do i

661
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
build

662
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,919
secure coding skills

663
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,840
so let's say that they come out of tech

664
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
elevator and

665
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,960
um then what right because they got

666
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,000
their one day

667
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,559
in class and even if you're in a

668
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,080
four-year university if you're going

669
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,840
down a certain track there's not

670
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,440
necessarily going to be cyber security

671
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
built into your program

672
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
so they're a great talk so again love

673
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,200
serendipity when i was

674
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,279
writing this talk originally i did it

675
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,559
for um

676
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,080
that women who code um

677
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,240
this popped into my feed right this

678
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
devsec con 24

679
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,200
24 hours around the world they broke it

680
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,919
up into the

681
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,120
three segments of north america

682
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,480
europe and then um like the uh

683
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,760
japan uh australia time frame and so

684
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
around the clock you had experts from

685
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,840
around the world available to you

686
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,799
and um it was great this was my favorite

687
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
one here right because again i like the

688
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,080
gamification so

689
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,039
so i recommend to everybody go spend

690
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,159
your 20 minutes with

691
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,799
rosemary wang and play i spy and

692
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,320
insecure delivery pipeline

693
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,120
and it it doesn't have to be dry right

694
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
it can be fun

695
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,200
so if you want um something a little

696
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
more dry you can go to bright talk also

697
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,679
and do those

698
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,000
searches there and you're going to find

699
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,960
you know into

700
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
like the the sales people who are trying

701
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,840
to sell their

702
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
uh products they'll also have it and you

703
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
can learn from them too right you don't

704
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
have to buy products

705
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
to learn how to uh utilize the the

706
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,360
methodologies

707
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,840
so it's easy to find talks

708
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
you can find blogs so this is a tanya

709
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,720
janka and i don't know if i'm saying her

710
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,279
name right

711
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,360
and i joke that you know i don't

712
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,799
recommend her just because she has the

713
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,159
same color hair that i do

714
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,440
but she's awesome and if you

715
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,720
if you ca i'm not sure if you can read

716
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,559
it here but you know so she starts here

717
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,200
like

718
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
this bottom one is pushing left so she's

719
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,720
the one who says you know you've

720
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,960
i ha and she works in the environment so

721
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
she probably knows better than i that

722
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,559
you have to push left um

723
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,080
and it starts with part one and she has

724
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,399
like five parts i think of just the

725
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,679
pushing left part

726
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,679
she has up here url url parameters

727
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,720
um whatever it is that you're looking

728
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,120
for

729
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,000
um it has safe uh dependencies

730
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,720
so she has right here we have 12 there

731
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,080
she has two pages

732
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,360
of blog posts and she is from we

733
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,960
hack purple and she created that

734
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,000
organization

735
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
and um so right here at just one website

736
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,840
you can get

737
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,520
two dozen mini tutorials on how to

738
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,480
become

739
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,840
a a better more secure coder

740
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,840
and then there's my favorite part right

741
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,600
the game so again

742
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,679
at the same time that i was like writing

743
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,000
this this is my first experience with

744
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,320
this

745
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,520
this company and so at the i was

746
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,000
attending

747
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,279
virtually the um way west conference and

748
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,880
they had a ctf there

749
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,039
for coding and i played it a little bit

750
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,880
and again like i think if i'd been

751
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,960
a developer or coder i would have done

752
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,080
much better in it

753
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,080
but i loved it right so um and

754
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,760
when i went in there what they do is

755
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,840
they give you these blocks of code

756
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
and they mark a few of them they say

757
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,279
which piece is the one

758
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,760
that is insecure and so you pick that

759
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,480
one

760
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,760
i actually got a couple right

761
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,880
and then um it gives you the opportunity

762
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
to fix the code

763
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,880
right so then it gives you um the option

764
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,840
to go in

765
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,880
and fix the code so it can be fun right

766
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,799
like it's challenging

767
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,799
you get immediate feedback that oh yes i

768
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,279
was able to spot what needed to be fixed

769
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,080
um i bet you can't guess guess which

770
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
piece i found

771
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,080
input validation um

772
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
and so there are fun things out there to

773
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,600
do in order to learn

774
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,760
um command and control so

775
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,120
my very first one in my account

776
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,240
i was only able to get 75 points

777
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,360
in my first event with uh a command and

778
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
control range

779
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,080
and um honestly it could have just been

780
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,600
that i learned how to follow the rules i

781
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,440
don't even know at this point what my 75

782
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,480
points were for

783
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,039
but um and it was i do remember that it

784
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,679
was

785
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,760
their social networking uh app

786
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,559
and so over time so we can learn even i

787
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,120
can learn

788
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
you know not being a developer how to

789
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,120
improve so this is my most recent score

790
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,039
right i think it probably goes to 12 000

791
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,679
or something

792
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,960
but i'm really proud of my 37.70

793
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,559
compared to my 75 that i can learn uh

794
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,720
how to break the web apps right so again

795
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,840
i'm not the developer

796
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,399
but i can learn more easily how to break

797
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,080
the web applications

798
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,200
so um if you're a developer if you

799
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,039
wanted to go to the red team side

800
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,799
you're probably going to be way awesome

801
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,159
because you're gonna know

802
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,440
what other things you can be

803
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,039
compromising that i don't know because

804
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,480
i'm not on that side of it

805
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,880
and it's also if you're gonna stay on

806
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
the development side or do the blue team

807
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,600
side

808
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,240
then you know what people are using to

809
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,440
get into you

810
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,360
and so bhis actually buys

811
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,519
um the command and control when they

812
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,279
retire

813
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,480
and that one's not free right so

814
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,720
for 30 a month you can play inside of

815
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,039
their cyber range but not only do they

816
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,919
have

817
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,039
the old web apps that you can

818
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,399
play with but they actually have lessons

819
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,279
built into it so it teaches you what

820
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,080
you're looking at

821
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,159
at that web app it teaches you how to

822
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,279
compromise it

823
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,159
and so you can build it in a supported

824
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:50,720
uh

825
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,159
environment so uh

826
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,720
you already heard i have a huge bias

827
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,360
towards

828
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,960
uh black um

829
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
because i've learned so much from them

830
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
and so this is like

831
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,640
i think a great opportunity um and you

832
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,320
can go on the website you don't have to

833
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
like pay the 30

834
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
dollars to see what it's like right you

835
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
can go in there and poke around a bit

836
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,039
and see like oh is it worth my time what

837
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,399
would it be worth time for

838
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,919
the people in my environment to spend

839
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,880
some time here so

840
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,760
um i think if you use some of the tools

841
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,279
that i'm suggesting here maybe you can

842
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,440
be even better than a hedgehog right

843
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,760
maybe you can coat a porcupine instead

844
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,679
um so again that same week when i was

845
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,799
building this

846
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,519
this job came through right and i was

847
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,240
just like

848
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,919
i can't apply for this job right but a

849
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,919
developer who's been through that other

850
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,000
training

851
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,399
they could probably apply for a job like

852
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,760
this right like if you

853
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,200
code securely and you're um you have

854
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,240
that mentality

855
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,039
of a secure position then when these

856
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,080
jobs come up

857
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,960
out there that we have a huge need for

858
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,519
we can

859
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,600
kind of like piggyback on that code or

860
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
pipeline right

861
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,760
and um have our pipeline filled so that

862
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,879
these jobs are fulfilled

863
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,240
so i'm looking for any questions

864
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,840
okay so questions

865
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,240
anybody have any questions

866
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,919
when you're talking about scenarios like

867
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,200
all case scenarios

868
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,240
or just worst cases when i'm

869
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,399
like for the developers i think that

870
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,840
they should focus on

871
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,159
all scenarios right now and then there's

872
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,600
always time and money and there's the

873
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,640
balance right because that's where you

874
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
get the pushback right

875
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,760
but i think that the uh oh and i didn't

876
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,240
mention

877
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,679
back when i was going through the slides

878
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,000
but i think that as if you can have

879
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,799
a system where you the posture and the

880
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,159
mentality is already i want to secure

881
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,519
code securely then um

882
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,119
you're going to be able to broaden that

883
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,399
a little more easily right because it's

884
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,918
going to be already within their

885
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,159
bandwidth right like so if some of the

886
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,839
input validation is just automatic and

887
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,679
they're doing that then that gives you

888
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,399
room

889
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,440
to like add something more right and

890
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,399
it's also going to save time again when

891
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,320
the person who's doing the if they

892
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,079
it's a big enough company and you have

893
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,839
that specialized person who's going

894
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,719
through and saying ah

895
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,639
you missed this you missed this right if

896
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,199
it's and not having to have it be sent

897
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,320
back

898
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,639
so i think if you um have that mentality

899
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,679
it's easier to do more than if

900
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,079
than if you're starting from zero

901
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,839
any other questions we got any online

902
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,520
no we do not no not yet okay so i i have

903
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,400
some stories that

904
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,839
uh obviously uh through my many years of

905
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,079
cyber experience coding

906
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,839
hacking and testing all that good stuff

907
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,359
i've been doing this for

908
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,800
over 30 years so one of the stories when

909
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,240
you talk about secure footprint oh by

910
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,839
the way i love that video that was great

911
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,160
when i talk to developers uh through

912
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,440
some of the stuff that i've been dealing

913
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,280
with in the past is that

914
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,320
uh you know a big great example is the

915
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,280
is the zip code field right so you ask

916
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,200
them okay put in the zip code

917
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,119
so they designed it right they don't do

918
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,119
any of the input testing or validation

919
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:37,520
or any

920
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,800
kind of stuff and so you put in 45431

921
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,079
the area code here

922
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,720
uh in the area but then you're like hey

923
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,119
well what about letters and numbers

924
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,920
right so uh when they're developing this

925
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,960
stuff they should be

926
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,480
only allowed to enter digits

927
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,800
and not alpha alphabet right

928
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,359
and so you know those are ways to test

929
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,320
it so i know

930
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
daryl's got some great stories that he's

931
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,920
told through the years with putting in

932
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
percent x and some other things in the

933
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,800
input fields and

934
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,359
you know the other one is uh bobby drop

935
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,640
tables is another great

936
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,240
example yep i know how to do that one

937
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,259
[Laughter]

938
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
question

939
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
no no i'm just talking u.s right yeah no

940
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,320
no no

941
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,160
i'm talking u.s right so when you're

942
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,520
filling out and you get

943
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,079
because it's a u.s address you know

944
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,240
that's where the zip codes are usually

945
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,960
i mean that's you know now expanding out

946
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,079
into the international

947
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,280
well that's that's a different

948
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,440
requirement but again right

949
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
based on that input or even phone

950
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,960
numbers right

951
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,480
you know how many times you fill out a

952
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
form and you type in

953
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,200
you know extra characters in there um

954
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,640
they're getting better about it because

955
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,000
now it rejects it says

956
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,480
digits only you know you can't even put

957
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
in the parentheses for the area code and

958
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,040
the little hyphen for between that

959
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,079
so they're getting better they're

960
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,839
getting smarter the words are getting

961
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:20,800
out that you know

962
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,599
this development it should be you know

963
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,320
doing this

964
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,240
secure coding earlier in that

965
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,520
development process

966
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,960
that well that's right right like what

967
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,400
you're saying if there's a check right

968
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,359
so like

969
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,200
um if it says maine as the as the state

970
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,520
then it will probably you know the coder

971
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
can write it so that it skips that

972
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,200
uh validation and maybe jumps to a

973
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,960
different validation and the same for

974
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,480
the international like you know there

975
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
are ways that the coder i mean that's

976
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,680
you know that's the point right the

977
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,839
coder should be able to like think about

978
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:50,480
what is that

979
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,240
person going to try and stick in there

980
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,000
and how do we keep them

981
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,320
locked into getting just what we want to

982
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
get from it yeah i mean

983
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
i mean back in my early coding days

984
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,760
right it was

985
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,240
let me get it done to be able to turn in

986
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,960
or do the

987
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,760
do the job right i'll go back later and

988
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,880
fix it

989
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,440
right sure right you've all heard that

990
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,359
we'll go back and fix that later when it

991
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,720
goes to production

992
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,599
and what ends up happening that that

993
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,000
test

994
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,240
stuff gets the into turns into

995
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,800
production and it's never validated so

996
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,320
you know that's why we've got to you

997
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
know provide this education and

998
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,440
start doing the earlier processes of

999
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,200
testing and developing

1000
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,040
earlier in the life cycle for this stuff

1001
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,880
so because you know most typical

1002
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,320
programmers they just want to get it

1003
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
working because then we're moving on to

1004
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,480
the next thing

1005
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,359
they're lazy you know and they just want

1006
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,720
to get it to function

1007
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
and it's like why would anybody enter

1008
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,520
something in anyways because

1009
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,000
it says to put in a zip code why would

1010
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
you put anything different in there

1011
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,599
right because that's why most engineers

1012
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,359
programmers people think because they

1013
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,520
want to get it done

1014
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,560
i'd like to offer a friendly challenge

1015
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,880
sure are they lazy or are they being

1016
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
incentivized by the organization

1017
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,119
for a different metric than what you

1018
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,400
care about make sure they're

1019
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,240
incentivized by delivery of features

1020
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,160
not going from breaking the critical

1021
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,920
delivery dates true

1022
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,079
that is a good point right that that

1023
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,520
could be that as well

1024
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,079
and when you when you say you know other

1025
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,599
incentives right when they

1026
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,440
uh based on features right microsoft

1027
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,760
excel anybody remember a few years back

1028
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,960
when uh you know

1029
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,040
they got paid by the line of code nobody

1030
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,079
actually checked

1031
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,720
and it actually had a flight simulator

1032
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,599
embedded

1033
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,280
because they've got so many extra lines

1034
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,680
of code and you've had the right easter

1035
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,200
egg you were actually able to launch

1036
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,359
some flight simulator out of excel if

1037
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,200
you had to write keystrokes

1038
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,960
right because nobody checked or

1039
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,440
validated based on the number of codes

1040
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,520
it was that was that on purpose well

1041
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
sure it was because they got nobody was

1042
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,359
checking but that's an input validation

1043
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,520
and let's do some like libraries within

1044
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,200
your organization right because i think

1045
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,440
um micah makes a very valid point

1046
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,880
especially when you're looking

1047
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,200
at some of like the agile and you know

1048
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,640
you have your two-week sprint and you

1049
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,280
have to get

1050
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,560
certain things done in that amount of

1051
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,720
time and is that my priority

1052
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,760
so building that secure posture as part

1053
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,040
of your culture

1054
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,079
is crucial right and then maybe

1055
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,680
incentivizing kind of like what you're

1056
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,960
saying like oh

1057
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
i built this piece of input validation

1058
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
that we can add to our library

1059
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
that you know you don't have to like

1060
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,720
necessarily start from scratch

1061
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,880
and so within your organization having

1062
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,560
some templates in place that people can

1063
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,119
use for things that are done often

1064
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,319
so uh any other questions comments but i

1065
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,119
did want to ask

1066
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,400
uh you were saying um you're working

1067
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
with

1068
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,560
northern kentucky university university

1069
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,480
is part of the nsa

1070
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,960
gen cyber program program so that's a is

1071
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,359
that a center of excellence through nsa

1072
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,800
um well right so thank you for giving me

1073
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
that back so yes it is a center of

1074
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,359
excellence

1075
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,480
and um so their program is a center of

1076
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,960
excellence but they've also have like a

1077
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,599
an additional project there are only 10

1078
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,480
in the country

1079
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,839
they only award 10 right places the

1080
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,319
opportunity to teach a gen cyber class

1081
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,599
and so um dr anker

1082
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,240
and um he lets you just say dr anker

1083
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,960
because his

1084
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,440
last name is harder to say than mine so

1085
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,319
it is a long

1086
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,680
um last name that starts with the ch

1087
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,880
chad potty maybe um he

1088
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,480
was able to win a

1089
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
one of the contracts to do the gen cyber

1090
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,160
and he spent

1091
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,240
two weeks teaching high school teachers

1092
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,079
cyber security so that they can get it

1093
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
into their classrooms and hopefully get

1094
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,240
that idea of like oh this might be a fun

1095
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,040
thing or

1096
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,160
uh to do when i grow up for the high

1097
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,200
school students

1098
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,040
and it was a whole range you did not

1099
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,119
have to be a computer science teacher we

1100
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,839
had

1101
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,800
um some generalists we starting down

1102
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,400
like from the fifth grade

1103
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,280
and we had like a chemistry teacher and

1104
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,640
a history teacher

1105
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,240
and so we talked to them about like well

1106
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,760
how can you talk about

1107
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,920
uh cyber security in the classroom

1108
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,359
depending on what your

1109
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,200
area is so you know i think that the uh

1110
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,040
cryptography is easy to do in history

1111
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,480
right so you can talk about it during

1112
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,359
world war two

1113
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,359
you can give them or you can talk about

1114
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,280
caesar cipher exactly you can talk about

1115
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,520
it

1116
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,880
even in the ancient history so yeah

1117
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,000
so i i was going to add to that right so

1118
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,079
i was very fortunate through my through

1119
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,960
my career i was actually

1120
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,599
given a scholarship through nsa for it

1121
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,280
was back then it was called information

1122
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
assurance scholarship program

1123
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,040
and so they they sent me to school to

1124
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,200
get my phd and that was paid for by nsa

1125
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,560
that's awesome right so that's that's

1126
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
how i got my phd but

1127
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,240
they've it kind of changed the name it's

1128
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
still available right now through other

1129
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,560
various institutions and they're now

1130
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,960
formed it out to the universities where

1131
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,280
they

1132
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,920
have the center of excellence uh and and

1133
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,480
so that scholarship is still available

1134
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
for your and they've gone they've

1135
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,920
actually moved it down it used to be

1136
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,359
masters phd

1137
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,520
but now they now they also do it for

1138
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,040
bachelors and they're trying to get it

1139
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,319
that pushed down to

1140
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,319
the high school levels as well so but

1141
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,720
it's now the

1142
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,400
cyber security scholarship program but

1143
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,720
if you go out to nsa's website they have

1144
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,960
all the educational institutions that

1145
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,079
are associated with

1146
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,599
centers of excellence that are funded by

1147
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
nsa to teach cyber security and get

1148
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,440
enrolled in those programs so

1149
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,960
if you're if you know folks that are

1150
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,200
trying to get educated looking for extra

1151
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,640
help or assistance

1152
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
a lot of times what they do is if you

1153
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,319
accept that scholarship you'll have a

1154
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:42,960
job

1155
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,040
on the other end working for a

1156
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
government entity

1157
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,119
where they help place you to actually

1158
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,200
then pay back some of that scholarship

1159
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,839
money

1160
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,160
but you're doing work in cyber security

1161
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,760
right you get your degree they pay for

1162
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
it and then you go and then

1163
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,000
they give you a job like i mean how

1164
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,200
often do you get to do that kind of

1165
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,760
stuff so

1166
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,599
that's awesome it's really a great

1167
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,720
program so i am a beneficiary of that

1168
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,119
and

1169
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,440
so one of the things that i try to do is

1170
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,240
actually also promote that because

1171
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,040
one of the clauses so to speak uh was to

1172
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,359
help

1173
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,760
advertiser promote right the nsa

1174
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,359
scholarship programs

1175
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,440
so there are a lot of institutions it's

1176
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,119
grown quite a bit over the last few

1177
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:23,920
years

1178
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,000
with nsa and i didn't realize northern

1179
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,760
kentucky was one of them so yeah

1180
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,000
and the cyber academy at muscatatuck is

1181
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,800
where i went in is

1182
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,560
yeah that's that's nice the cyber range

1183
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
out there yep yep i was there before it

1184
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,000
became that but then they were making

1185
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,599
that transition so that's that's pretty

1186
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,520
neat where you get to go test some iot

1187
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,480
stuff

1188
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,640
so it's a nice iot range out there in

1189
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,680
indiana so

1190
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,359
that was that's pretty neat so if you

1191
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,720
get a chance to do that

1192
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
um the other thing i was going to

1193
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,319
mention um

1194
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,640
so you were talking about oh nice

1195
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,000
initiative i don't know if anybody's

1196
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,599
familiar with that national initiative

1197
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,520
of cyber security education

1198
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,000
right that's uh sponsored by nist right

1199
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
so they put out all this academia

1200
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,319
stuff they work with the various uh

1201
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,440
educational

1202
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,880
institutions right and and try and help

1203
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,440
form uh relationships between the

1204
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,960
universities and the businesses and

1205
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,560
stuff like that to help promote cyber

1206
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,160
security education

1207
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,240
so that's a that's another avenue if you

1208
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,440
go to nist uh

1209
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,760
look at nice national initiative for

1210
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,599
cyber security education along with

1211
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,480
nsa so that's another avenue to look for

1212
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,920
for like scholarships for

1213
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,760
for people trying to get you know

1214
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,599
bachelor's masters phds and

1215
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,079
and cyber security and then also you

1216
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,520
know they help partner with

1217
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,160
them placement afterwards for for

1218
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,880
education

1219
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,079
so it's um here in here in dayton uh we

1220
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,280
got wright state

1221
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,599
and ud and they they also have cybers i

1222
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,160
was a

1223
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,720
adjunct over at wright state they have a

1224
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,160
four plus one program

1225
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,400
where you go in your senior year start

1226
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,040
taking classes for your master's

1227
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,800
you do the four plus one and then you

1228
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,240
come out with a master's in cyber

1229
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,040
security

1230
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,480
so that's a pretty good program so

1231
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,560
you're only in five years versus six for

1232
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,599
a master's

1233
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,920
in cyber security so your your undergrad

1234
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,359
will be computer science computer

1235
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,079
engineering

1236
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,319
something of that nature and then your

1237
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,839
masters would be focused on cyber

1238
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,119
security uh ud

1239
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,839
does more of the uh information

1240
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,119
management type

1241
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,240
uh or the business side of the house

1242
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,680
so that's kind of the relationship

1243
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359
between ud and wright state here in the

1244
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,319
in

1245
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,160
in the dayton area for for academia so

1246
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,319
yes go ahead matt student claire oh yeah

1247
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,680
and sinclair thank you

1248
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,240
and sinclair they do a lot of uh early

1249
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,839
entry-level stuff they help with the

1250
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,880
associates

1251
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,599
and there's and doing certifications

1252
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,800
they work with

1253
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,240
the various uh working employees uh so a

1254
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
lot of their other classes are geared

1255
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:50,960
towards the

1256
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,599
the working person so they're they're

1257
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,680
either online or at night so you can

1258
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,200
you know work towards get your either

1259
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,680
your certification or your associates

1260
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,760
and then transfer to ohio state wright

1261
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,800
state ud

1262
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,000
university of cincinnati kentucky now so

1263
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,800
um a lot of educational opportunities

1264
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,000
but you know this is stuff

1265
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,119
that uh is is very critical uh and

1266
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,440
you know hopefully as you continue to do

1267
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,040
this because you started in

1268
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,079
education right transitioned into the

1269
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,280
cyber field

1270
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,720
right but these are different avenues

1271
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,559
that you can use to help with that whole

1272
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,040
education

1273
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,359
there are more programs coming out that

1274
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,880
are

1275
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,800
targeted at them like nku has just

1276
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,559
recently added i don't

1277
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,880
think it goes live until october you can

1278
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,559
start your certification process

1279
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,319
there and then you can work towards your

1280
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,800
masters once it goes live in october

1281
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,680
yep so all right anybody yes go ahead

1282
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,160
um

1283
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,400
yes cedarville is part of uh they are

1284
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,760
one of the they were

1285
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,480
uh i did a nist a nice conference with

1286
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,240
nist a few years ago in cedarville yes

1287
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,760
they did have

1288
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,960
uh some classes down there that were

1289
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,160
part of the i think it was associated

1290
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,119
more with nice

1291
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,480
not necessarily nsa so but you know part

1292
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,160
of that nice thing is is they

1293
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,880
develop the curriculum and they share so

1294
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,520
they'll say

1295
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,359
cedarville we want you to write this

1296
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,119
particular class

1297
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,800
but you have to share it with the other

1298
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,359
universities right and so what they do

1299
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,240
is they pick

1300
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,400
certain universities to write certain

1301
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,599
classes

1302
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,319
that they may be more focused on or

1303
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,720
their area of expertise based on the

1304
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,800
professors that are there and stuff like

1305
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,559
that and then they are asked them to

1306
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,480
share those modules

1307
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,640
to help other universities create a

1308
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,839
cyber program

1309
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,359
so yes thank you for that and i think

1310
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,359
that's the way that gen cyber is kind of

1311
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,960
set up that way as well so

1312
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,839
like the the curriculum that we wrote

1313
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,520
for that two weeks we provide

1314
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,760
lesson plans to nsa so that they can put

1315
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,280
them out on their website so yeah so

1316
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,880
just have that background and then they

1317
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,319
form it out to the appropriate

1318
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,160
universities institutions and stuff like

1319
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,520
that so

1320
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,119
and also i saw where sinclair offers

1321
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,160
a logistics base

1322
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,440
it's like a background

1323
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,839
logistics one no okay

1324
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,839
right so yeah logistics is huge i mean

1325
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,359
we've seen that back in december

1326
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,599
with supply chain right yeah

1327
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,359
with supply chain that's that's a huge

1328
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,880
issue right because if you're purchasing

1329
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
stuff that is not secure that can be a

1330
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,359
challenge too

1331
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,000
and they're they're supposedly trusted

1332
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,559
um

1333
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,359
you know supplies so um refresh me

1334
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,480
solarwinds

1335
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,160
right so the solar will intact uh

1336
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,280
they were how many locations

1337
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,880
did they get into because that was a

1338
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,119
trusted source supply

1339
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,960
right that we thought was all safe and

1340
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,319
