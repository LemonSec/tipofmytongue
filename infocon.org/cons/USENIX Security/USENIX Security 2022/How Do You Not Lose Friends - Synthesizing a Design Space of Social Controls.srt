1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,679
all right so hey there my name is Jacob

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,599
Logan I'm going to be presenting some

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,480
work in our lab as you said around

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,580
synthesizing design space for social

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,220
controls and shared digital resources

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,939
this was authored by temi Hanan and Alan

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,220
and of course shavik there at the end

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,419
and I'm going to be presenting

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,140
there we go so let's begin with an

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,940
informal pull of the room could

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,739
everybody raise their hand that shares a

12
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,279
Netflix account

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,280
just about everyone okay so we have uh

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,680
people from Netflix outside to collect

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,200
all the all the fees that you guys have

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,719
avoided

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,340
um so yeah as many of you are clearly

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,140
aware sharing accounts is becoming more

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,039
and more commonplace

20
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,020
with shared accounts as they exist now

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,300
though security and privacy is only as

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,920
strong as the weakest link

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,960
security and privacy controls generally

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,479
presume individual ownership of accounts

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,540
even those with sub-accounts if an

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,280
account is shared among users who are

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,260
not all s p Savvy there will be

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,960
vulnerabilities that can occur

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,759
um as I alluded to before albeit

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,460
jokingly individual ownership is

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,259
preferable to the corporations who

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,659
provide these services but the reality

33
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,640
is that accounts are being shared

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,200
between users

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
with this said there is little to no

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,979
guidance on what makes for good design

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,040
for communal security and privacy thus

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,840
any attempt to approach this problem

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,060
does so at the risk of overlooking

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,680
important considerations for design

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,780
therefore we took a human-centered

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,640
approach in exploring this design space

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,500
we investigated what key design

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,360
dimensions exist for controls on

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,340
communal design resources or sorry

46
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,979
communal digital resources and then we

47
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,720
interrogate what trade-offs may arise

48
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,100
for these dimensions

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,860
to answer our research questions uh that

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,840
you saw before we held participatory

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,540
design jams for those unfamiliar a

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,120
design Jam is a form of Workshop wherein

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,099
participants collectively brainstorm a

54
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,040
tool to address a specific problem

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,959
the jams produced both a record of the

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,599
proposals and a discussion or critique

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,540
of the proposals Among The Wider group

58
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,700
it's important to note we're not saying

59
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,260
that any one of these proposals are

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,840
things that should be implemented

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,120
instead we're using this as an exercise

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,340
of exposing important considerations to

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,260
find General design dimensions for the

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,440
space

65
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,280
so on the re uh on the things that came

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
out of our design jams We performed a

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,260
thematic analysis

68
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,760
to reveal design dimensions in the

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,780
trade-offs related to those

70
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,800
so to begin with design Dimensions we

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,739
identified from our analysis our social

72
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,480
transparency

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,760
stakes and responsibility

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
structures of governance and promotion

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,340
of pro-group SMP behaviors though these

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,959
Dimensions do have trade-offs

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,459
um some trade-offs apply only to a

78
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,959
single Dimension While others are

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,300
applicable across Dimensions the

80
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,620
following are some trade-offs which

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,319
we'll discuss as they arise in the

82
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,120
context of the dimensions

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,879
the first is security versus privacy

84
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,340
second is coordination costs

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,980
third social hurting and finally social

86
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,399
friction

87
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,860
so the first design consideration being

88
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,500
social transparency is the ability to

89
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
know what others in the group are up to

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,180
at any time in the shared resource

91
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,459
uh while socially translucent systems

92
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,379
and prior work also include things like

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,780
awareness and accountability visibility

94
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,379
was most present in our design jams

95
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,340
participants mentioned visibility

96
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,500
allowed for activity auditing especially

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,120
for groups with members seen as less

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,340
technically Savvy think parents or

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,860
grandparents this kind of hyper

100
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,840
vigilance addressed users feelings of

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,819
loss of control when they share a

102
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,280
resource

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,440
however this hypervision Springs a

104
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,620
trade-off between security and privacy

105
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,959
discussions around the familial context

106
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,360
see it as a boon actually to know what

107
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,919
is being done with the shared resource

108
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,240
by all members

109
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,979
this really reflects how parental

110
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,100
controls are designed allowing Elders to

111
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,199
keep an eye on children's activity

112
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,900
but in the context of friends and

113
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,300
roommates there was a preference against

114
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,240
this kind of visibility this probably

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,520
mostly arises from the need for privacy

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,080
between peers

117
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,540
going back to the Netflix example you

118
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
may have a guilty pleasure show that you

119
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,240
don't want to share with your friends

120
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,380
um so in addition designed for

121
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,060
colleagues who are similarly wary of

122
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,160
having their activity meant monitored

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,259
for fear of employer surveillance

124
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,540
this is more colored by existing system

125
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,000
used in employee surveillance think of

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,880
systems that detect whether or not you

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,259
leave your desk when you're working from

128
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,440
home

129
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,880
the second design consideration is

130
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,100
stakes and responsibility this one

131
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,020
emerged from desire for group members to

132
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,000
be equally invested in the security and

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,220
privacy of The Wider group

134
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,020
um some proposed rotating responsibility

135
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,940
among the group to avoid concentrating

136
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,639
power or prevent or presenting an undue

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,940
burden on a minority of the group

138
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,539
others wanted to share the risk through

139
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,580
collecting collateral

140
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,680
here collateral could be monetary or it

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,259
could be that they want to have

142
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,120
everybody entrust confidential personal

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,060
information into a shared resource

144
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,100
though this consideration as with the

145
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,259
others have trade-offs rotating

146
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,479
responsibility ensures power is shared

147
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,160
but it requires coordinating a schedule

148
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,800
for handing offset responsibility

149
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
similarly collecting and assessing

150
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
collateral needs to be coordinated by

151
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,259
the group with personal information

152
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,300
there has to be some sort of qualitative

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,820
assessment by the group on the value of

154
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,100
the information otherwise some group

155
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,780
members may feel that there's a balance

156
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,919
of risk if we think monetarily too if an

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,740
equal amount of money is put into the

158
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,840
account

159
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,580
um

160
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,740
some members may be better or worse off

161
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,539
than others and at that point are they

162
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,919
really putting in the same amount of

163
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,280
risk

164
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,780
and our third dimension is the

165
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,699
structures of governance this really

166
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,500
describes how decisions for a shared

167
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,020
resource are made governance structures

168
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,180
propose reflected existing systems of

169
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,280
governance and really tended to map on

170
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,620
how social groups were already organized

171
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,780
egalitarian governance for example were

172
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,280
mentioned more in social groups without

173
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,900
any inherent in structure think

174
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,840
friendships where in a head wherein a

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,940
healthy relationship All actors are

176
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,280
acting as equals on the other hand

177
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,740
hierarchical forms of government were

178
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,300
mentioned for groups that already have a

179
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,520
hierarchy you think the family with the

180
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,240
parents and children

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,419
so in governance again there are several

182
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,400
trade-offs the first is the problem of

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,380
social herding and this trade-off

184
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,660
there's uh group members could observe

185
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,759
how others vote and it may influence

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,919
their own votes and hierarchical

187
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,660
governance we could see this being a

188
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,060
problem where those with greater power

189
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,880
May introduce fears of Retribution if

190
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,500
you vote against them

191
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,660
similarly an egalitarian governance

192
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,940
voters may be influenced by some

193
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,880
perceived traits of its members think

194
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,220
popularity or perceived competency

195
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,380
another trade-off like before is

196
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,900
coordination costs a resource may be

197
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,180
governed by consensus but consensus does

198
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,819
require members to be available

199
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,199
depending on the decision-making process

200
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
this could pose a greater burden in

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,580
hierarchical models since decision

202
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,560
decision makers must be constantly

203
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
available

204
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,500
and then lastly for governance social

205
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,419
friction becomes a trade-off

206
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,759
in egalitarian systems group dynamics

207
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,639
akin to social herding are an issue for

208
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,319
example members may not want to upset

209
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,759
another member for fear of social

210
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,360
retribution and members in power of

211
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,620
hierarchical systems may have attention

212
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,020
with other members in the case of the

213
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,440
participant here he desires unquestioned

214
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,660
access to Shared resource without peer

215
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,139
approval

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,820
and our last design Dimension relates to

217
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,559
the promotion of group security and

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,958
privacy behaviors

219
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,059
encouraging good grouped s p behavior

220
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,099
for the benefit of the group

221
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,080
here non-binding agreements with the

222
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,880
security score helped quantify the

223
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,920
security and privacy performance of end

224
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
group individuals friend groups tended

225
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,680
towards what they consider shame works

226
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,980
as being a way to enforce better

227
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,399
Behavior introducing peer pressure to

228
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,959
motivate better security and privacy

229
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,080
behavior and then lastly introducing

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
rewards and Punishment schemes were

231
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,940
proposed for improving Behavior usually

232
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,980
in the context of co-workers but not

233
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,640
exclusively

234
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,320
and of course as with the others this

235
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,100
came with a trade-off

236
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,600
for this one designers need to remember

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
that social systems do come with social

238
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,779
dynamics

239
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,760
in the case of Rewards or punishments

240
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,800
relationships among group members may

241
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,140
not be equal and that can create issues

242
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,300
group members may have an argument

243
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,459
leading to access controls being used in

244
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,940
a malicious way and a bid to get back at

245
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,760
another member and similarly members may

246
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,560
not want to enforce agreed upon rules

247
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,540
for fear of reducing social social

248
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,420
standing or introducing a conflict

249
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,100
and the words of one participant

250
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,140
critiquing an approach with strikes for

251
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,640
bad behavior

252
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,959
how do you not lose friends

253
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,180
so in summary we collected 11 design

254
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,880
proposals from 43 participants across

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
four social groups and by qualitative

256
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,240
qualitatively announced analyzing the

257
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
proposals and their discussion we

258
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,080
identified four design dimensions for

259
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,200
social resource sharing controls and for

260
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,060
trade-offs across them

261
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,060
key takeaways from this work communal

262
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,839
resource s p controls do not have a

263
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,820
one-size-fit-all design approach and

264
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,100
social systems can and will be subject

265
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,140
to social pressures that need to be

266
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,339
considered when you're making these

267
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,720
kinds of systems

268
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,580
uh we hope this work will help to better

269
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,620
understand the requirements for good s p

270
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,920
design and communal resources and I'm

271
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,819
good to take any questions
