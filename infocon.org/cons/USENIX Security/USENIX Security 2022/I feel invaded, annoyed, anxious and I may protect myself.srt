1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,559
hello everyone so I'm cavilla

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,019
um so This research contributes to the

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,599
usable privacy research area

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,420
the general public opinion in National

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,420
surveys as reported in the UK and Europe

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,939
is that tracking online is a privacy

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,460
concern for most citizens

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,859
this has been reported by the Oxford

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,320
internet Institute as well as the

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,780
European commission however previous

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,360
academic research shows that individuals

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,059
have inaccurate an incomplete mental

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,000
models of the mecadex behavioral

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,700
advertising and have misconceptions

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,760
about the purpose of cookies

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,219
in addition uses mental models of

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,920
tracking only weekly relate to their

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,140
production Behavior

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,260
and so actually privacy as a cognitive

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,860
process is quite common uh in usable

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,680
privacy research in the sense that there

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,220
is a lot of Investigation looking at

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,140
people's mental models their perceptions

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,200
or their understanding and awareness of

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,140
risk of consequences of protective

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,220
Technologies Etc however this barely a

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,040
handful of research that links people's

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,360
emotion to their productive Behavior

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,259
and literature already provides a number

30
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,680
of theoretical grounding

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,100
to depict how our immersion influence

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,240
our decision making and this is just a

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,860
few of them and if you'd like to know

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,720
more about these theories please have a

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,659
look at the paper where we discuss them

36
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,119
so given this background we wanted to

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
investigate how people's feelings in

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,020
particularly in the context of online

39
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,799
tracking associate with and impact their

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,540
productive actions

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,479
so we contacted the survey online via

42
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,540
prolific academic in 2020

43
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,139
we balance our sample according to the

44
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,020
genders of women and men the Russian

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,060
news that was there is two piece of

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,840
previous research that says that women

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,819
tend to be more concerned about their

48
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,819
privacy online and then that men tend to

49
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,920
engage more with technical production

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,420
compared to women

51
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,260
we also balance our sample according to

52
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,840
Country three different countries the

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,540
reason for that is that this in the UK

54
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,819
and European regions these countries had

55
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,040
the highest number of Internet users at

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,099
the time meaning a higher number of

57
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,280
potential people being exposed to online

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
tracking and then National culture

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
itself as a collective mindset

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,340
distinguishing how people in one country

61
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,019
uh think or behave compared to another

62
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,080
is a is a valuable factor to look at

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,019
privacy uh concerns uh feelings and

64
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,760
behavior

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,340
so we collected data by quality

66
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,739
elicitation via open-ended questions

67
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,739
then the open-ended responses were

68
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,900
interactively content analyzed and we

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,180
conducted a statistical analysis of

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,620
those responses afterwards

71
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,300
if we look at our men versus women

72
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,599
subgroup we find that they had a similar

73
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,319
mean age group The

74
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,659
they were also of similar education

75
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,780
level as well as they had a majority of

76
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,019
people from Caucasian community

77
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,540
however across the different countries

78
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,400
there were slight differences in our

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
subsample

80
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,140
for example this from the UK reported to

81
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,200
have a higher number were from a higher

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,659
number of college graduate people or

83
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,420
others with an undergrad degree are

84
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,239
people from the French subgroup had

85
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,459
reported a higher number of people with

86
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,000
Masters or PhD degrees

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,959
in terms of ethnicity it was between 80

88
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
to 93 percent reporting to bigger

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,858
occasion

90
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,519
so on to the results of our study first

91
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,320
for the research question how do

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,940
individuals feel in regards to

93
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,699
third-party tracking given their gender

94
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,699
and Country differences

95
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,880
so what other content analysis we

96
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,120
identify four main categories of feeling

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,800
tones

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,280
in the first category of people saying

99
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,960
they were generally not okay or

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
expressing negative feeling tones there

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,919
were those who mentioned literally just

102
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,500
being not okay or not liking online

103
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,759
tracking

104
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,400
then there were those people nearly 18

105
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,860
percent who talk about a sense of

106
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,440
boundary loss or Invasion that went

107
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,380
beyond the information

108
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,180
privacy or data privacy sphere they felt

109
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,780
invaded violated in their own human head

110
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,300
um so they spoke about violation being

111
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,199
exposed exploited feeling unsafe treated

112
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,900
as not the human being feeling naked

113
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,919
even

114
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,860
other spoke of the unfairness of the

115
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,340
practice and talking about powerlessness

116
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,100
or helplessness naming that they were

117
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,900
feeling betrayed that the practice is

118
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,320
dissonance or feeling trapped

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,199
others Express anger-related emotion via

120
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,320
annoyance irritation being bothered by

121
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,060
The Practice

122
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,919
still other participants talk about

123
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,520
anxiety emotions so they said that

124
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,740
tracking is pretty scary they felt

125
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,100
worried and felt that it was spooky

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,300
other participants expressed discomfort

127
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,259
um

128
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,139
saying that the tracking online they

129
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,780
felt anything about it or expressed that

130
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,840
they were not comfortable or some of

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,180
them talk about

132
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,340
tracking being a suspicious practice and

133
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,320
saying that they were not trust trusting

134
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,639
that

135
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,400
so if we summarize those negative

136
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,280
feeling tones across this visual

137
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,340
or we can actually see that women are

138
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,919
more expressive of not being okay or

139
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,660
expressing negative feelings with

140
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,520
regards to tracking online

141
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,460
and we can also see that participants

142
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,259
from the UK were less expressive

143
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,759
compared to those from France and

144
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,780
Germany

145
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,419
at the same time if we look closely into

146
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,400
the different emotions up till the

147
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,979
emotion of annoyance we can see that

148
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,300
actually men are expressing more

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,039
negative emotions but then when you

150
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,740
combine anxiety discomfort and distress

151
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,800
then we have a higher percentage of

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,039
women

153
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,560
so in the category of people expressing

154
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,319
uh big sometimes okay or not okay there

155
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,539
was this sense of ambivalence with

156
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,160
participants saying I'm okay with it but

157
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,440
at the same time I know it's a bit bad I

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,539
feel intruded but I accept it or

159
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,759
literally mentioning the word ambivalent

160
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,560
then there were there is a smaller

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,720
percentage that talk about being okay

162
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,139
under certain conditions

163
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,720
and a small Advantage again talk about

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,199
uh feeling okay but because they had

165
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,479
already taken an action to protect

166
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,400
themselves

167
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,000
in the category of those expressing that

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
they were generally okay or indifferent

169
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,560
with tracking here you'll notice that

170
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,599
those are smaller percentage of

171
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,819
participants compared to those who

172
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,800
Express negative turns

173
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,780
the others were just said I'm okay with

174
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,880
it I'm all right with it I'm comfortable

175
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,319
with it

176
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,479
um others say you know I'm it's I'm a

177
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,180
bit indifferent to this or others saying

178
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,220
it's a necessary part of transacting

179
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,240
online

180
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,479
and other participants yes saying like

181
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,880
you know I have no feelings about this I

182
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
don't think feeling in any particular

183
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,819
way

184
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,419
then in the other group category we had

185
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,400
those who said that this practice should

186
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,660
be regulated

187
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,960
so here to note it's what parts man felt

188
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,580
it's not necessarily what is already

189
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,860
covered in the gdpr or the UK data

190
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,780
production act so they said that

191
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,539
tracking should be regulated should be

192
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,220
forbidden it should be made illegal

193
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,740
should be banned or it should be made

194
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,180
more transparent

195
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,099
and yet again there were those who said

196
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,260
you know I have no idea what the what

197
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,880
this practice is and I don't know enough

198
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,059
about it to respond

199
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,479
so moving on to the next part of our

200
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
research we wanted to know so what do

201
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,920
people do about tracking online given

202
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,420
what they feel

203
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,180
here we sold out about 35 percent our

204
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,920
participants reported to not doing

205
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
anything about tracking and then a

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,540
higher percentage of those who took

207
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,160
action say that they use browse

208
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,800
extensions or clear cookies use private

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,860
browsing or a privacy oriented browser

210
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,880
Etc or even those who said like I look

211
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,740
into the website and see whether I feel

212
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,260
suspicious Etc I use anti-malware

213
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,779
antivirus again this is what people are

214
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,180
actually doing rather than what we think

215
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,279
as researchers there should be doing to

216
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,959
protect themselves

217
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,980
so visualizing the actions now

218
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,140
again we can see up between the

219
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,800
different gender that women have

220
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
reported to not take any productive

221
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,959
actions more than one in the right part

222
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,440
of the of this diagram and then if we

223
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,019
compare between countries we can again

224
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,839
see that the UK participants reported to

225
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,300
not act to protect themselves compared

226
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,680
from to those from France and Germany

227
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
um and now we wanted to to look further

228
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
into

229
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
how these feelings that were expressed

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,519
are how they are associated with whether

231
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,040
people take protective actions or not

232
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
so we computed a multivariate

233
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
correspondence analysis to look at the

234
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,820
strength of association between feeling

235
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,940
tones and productive behavior and then

236
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,580
we visualize this Association on the

237
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,040
spatial map so this special map is

238
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,959
actually quite intuitive because if you

239
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,180
look on the left you can see that those

240
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,760
who Express feeling not aware not not

241
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,019
having any immersion or being

242
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,480
indifferent or furthest away from taking

243
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,700
any action so but they are closest to

244
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,279
none no action and then there is in the

245
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,019
middle who are okay okay on the side

246
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,480
they can certain condition or ambivalent

247
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,220
or a little bit closer to doing

248
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,380
something but still in the middle

249
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,060
and then we have those people who

250
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,000
Express anxiety annoyance not being okay

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,579
Etc we can see that this these feelings

252
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,100
are closer so more associated with

253
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,959
actually protecting oneself

254
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,000
next part we wanted to see how feelings

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,940
actually predict taking a productive

256
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,040
action or not whatever that action may

257
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,880
be

258
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,240
and so we computed a logistic regression

259
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,320
with a protective action or no action or

260
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,140
Target variable and gender country and

261
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,300
negative terms as predictors so what we

262
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,720
can see here is that men are more than

263
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,480
twice more likely than women to act

264
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,100
productively

265
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,920
those from Germany and the UK and France

266
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,959
sorry are nearly twice more likely to

267
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,300
act and those feeling those negative

268
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,220
turns that are highlighted are between

269
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,180
2.5 to nearly four times more likely to

270
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,240
take protective actions

271
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,300
so the takeaways of this study is that

272
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,360
it provides an improvement on the soilic

273
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,339
oriented cognitive oriented

274
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,140
investigation of tracking that we've

275
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,839
been used to

276
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,640
and the sort of Investigation we've been

277
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,000
used to in usable privacy research

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,560
already which is mostly cognitive

279
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,620
oriented so we we also notice similarly

280
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,500
to literature that feelings can provide

281
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,839
us with user useful inputs about

282
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,720
judgment decision and behavior when

283
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,579
people's cognitive evaluation of a

284
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,519
situation is inaccurate and incomplete

285
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,920
which is usually the case for Lay users

286
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,500
in privacy and security area

287
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,160
we also saw an indication of a privacy

288
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,720
gender gap

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,720
and also that in UK individuals reported

290
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,899
less active protections and were less

291
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,500
expressive of negative feelings so this

292
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,720
actually

293
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,820
requires further investigation about why

294
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,500
this is happening

295
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,899
the implications of our finding for

296
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,260
researchers it's important for us to

297
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,079
to deepen our understanding of the

298
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,779
factors

299
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,000
between us feeling negatively about our

300
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,760
privacy online and then taking action so

301
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,560
what are the challenges what are the

302
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,620
steps that we need to to include to help

303
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,600
people take action

304
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,180
so for designers and providers

305
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,279
technology providers it's important to

306
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,079
understand who are more receptive to

307
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,240
privacy Technologies and who are not and

308
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,940
how to cut customize ways to upskill

309
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,399
people given their gender differences or

310
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,500
country differences or other demographic

311
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,060
differences

312
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,100
for regulators and National Data

313
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,959
protection operators

314
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,600
it's indeed important to

315
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,660
to have guidelines for fair practices to

316
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,339
ensure that websites and service

317
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,860
providers are not nudging people into

318
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,079
accepting things that they are not okay

319
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,180
with

320
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,220
um yeah

321
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,959
um so this is the end of my presentation

322
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll be happy to take questions now or

323
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,779
have a chat later
