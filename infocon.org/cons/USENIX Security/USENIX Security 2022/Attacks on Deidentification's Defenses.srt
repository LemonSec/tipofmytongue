1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,980
cool uh thanks everybody for coming and

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,500
uh thanks to the program committee for

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,900
giving me an award yesterday that was uh

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,480
unexpected

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,880
um I'm going to start by giving you some

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,560
backgrounds uh that will help you

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,199
understand what we do and why we do it

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,980
so this is important for uh like the

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,840
sort of understanding the goal of the

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,560
work

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,960
uh and it all starts with canonimity and

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
the best way to explain can anonymity is

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,320
with an example so here's an example of

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,899
a data set on the left a k anonymized

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,760
data set on the right K here is a number

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,100
it's three

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,660
and so what can anonymity thinks about

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,660
is you take some attributes that are

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,160
quasi-identifiers those are defined to

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,420
be the attributes that in combination

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,520
can uniquely identify individuals that's

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,100
the that's what it can quasi-identifier

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,340
is supposed to be I'll abbreviate a qi

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,619
um and can anybody requires that if you

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,260
only look at the quasi-identifiers on

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,939
the right every record looks like three

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,799
other like three records you can't

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
distinguish uh any record uh from from

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,960
two others so that's quite uh can

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,580
anonymity

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,640
um it's often achieved uh as Teresa even

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,920
mentioned or yeah as Teresa mentioned by

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,200
generalization and suppression uh so

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,060
here are some examples bucketing ages

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,280
into groups of five you know suppressing

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
gender uh grouping degrees into

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,799
different uh categories uh so I'm going

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,000
to call all of these techniques

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,040
hierarchical techniques and you can look

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,659
at the picture and you'll understand why

41
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,880
I call them hierarchical

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,860
um but generally it's uh you know using

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,720
generalization and suppression

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,060
uh I'm also going to say that a

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,579
anonymizer is minimal if it doesn't

46
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,000
generalize any attribute more than is uh

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,280
strictly necessary so this is in a local

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,020
sense not a global sense so you don't

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,479
run into any NP hardness results

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,000
um but minimal minimal means didn't over

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,399
generalize

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,680
so after anonymity there's a bunch of

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
other techniques right so there were 10

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,660
years of techniques uh too many for me

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,819
to understand but I want to think about

56
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,800
them all together so I'm going to think

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
about them uh I'm going to call them all

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,060
quasi-identifier based the

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,280
identification which is defined to be

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,739
all the techniques that collapse down to

61
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,200
can anonymity if you think about every

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,060
attribute as a quasi-identifying

63
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,980
attribute so in some sense this is the

64
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,200
sort of this best case for privacy for

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,260
can anonymity and the so the core tenet

66
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,420
of this whole conceptual approach to the

67
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,280
identification can anonymity and all of

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,379
these techniques is that if every

69
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,519
attribute is treated as a

70
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,720
quasi-identifier then can anonymity

71
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,739
provides some sort of meaningful

72
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,739
protection that's the basic core idea

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,260
proposal of canonivity

74
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,940
and so there were 10 years of

75
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,700
anonymization wars

76
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,800
which happened long ago

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,140
um and the anti-d-identification side

78
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,540
said that these techniques don't prevent

79
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,019
inferences uh that this whole

80
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,459
quasi-identifier not quasi-identifier

81
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,739
distinction is untenable

82
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,180
um and also you know you can prove

83
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,120
things like contrived mechanisms fail or

84
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,940
or they doesn't offer guarantees and the

85
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,120
pro de-identification crowd uh said well

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,640
you know we can prevent particular types

87
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,959
of inferences with all of those

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,340
techniques that were on the left a

89
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,260
minute ago

90
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,980
um also in in real life you know uh uh

91
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,959
experts can sort the quasi-identifiers

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,519
from the non-quasi identifiers there's

93
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,640
no real world attacks against uh data

94
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,200
sets that were de-identified according

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,040
to

96
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,980
um sort of the standards uh proposed in

97
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,959
privacy regulations in the identified by

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,900
experts that's uh properly identify

99
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,000
de-identified according to a a paper

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,819
from about 10 years ago

101
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,480
um

102
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,120
and also that the identification maybe

103
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,760
it doesn't satisfy the really ornery uh

104
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,920
cryptographers but it's good enough for

105
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,680
Regulators that's sort of the argument

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,659
and so what happened at the end of the

107
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,120
anonymization wars uh uh the security

108
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,299
and privacy Community said okay we're

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,579
we're done with this

110
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,358
um and the the identifiers uh uh you

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,000
know declared victory in a sense so even

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
even though uh uh it's it's not uh

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,940
exciting uh maybe for this crowd because

114
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,919
a lot of people here probably know that

115
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,380
these techniques are broken

116
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,080
um they're still enshrined in in in in

117
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,900
uh in regulation so this is a HIPAA at

118
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,080
the top gdpr number two Google's using

119
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,940
it number three and that's a Israel

120
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,860
Health regulation that came out during

121
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,259
coven and they all enshrine or or

122
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,160
consider uh Canada to some extent

123
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,080
and so that was the State of Affairs

124
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
that is the State of Affairs and so our

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,759
goal in this work is not just to have

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,620
another attack a can anonymity But to

127
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,080
answer these particular arguments

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
uh so how are we going to do it uh first

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,660
attack all the quasi-identifiers at once

130
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,020
uh sorry consider attacks that work when

131
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,419
everything is a quasi-identifier and so

132
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,060
by doing that consider the whole slew of

133
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,919
techniques together not just any one of

134
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,479
them

135
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,800
um

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
we're going to only think about attacks

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,300
that use uh only the Quasi identifiers

138
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,060
uh uh which is going to answer this

139
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,880
second point and though these two sort

140
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,520
of Go Together by the way Define

141
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,139
quasi-identifying

142
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,199
quasi-identifier-based the

143
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,759
identification

144
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,039
uh we'll try to find a real world attack

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,660
against the properly date identified

146
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,479
data set and we'll do our best to bridge

147
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,000
the attacks in the policy

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,840
so that's the why and the goal and these

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,340
are the contributions so there's some

150
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,419
Theory

151
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,520
the theory is we introduce down coding

152
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,680
it's a new type of attack

153
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,080
we show that down coding attacks are

154
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,820
possible against every minimal

155
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,039
hierarchical k anonymizer

156
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,900
so it's not a con not contrived

157
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,240
mechanisms any mechanism that is both

158
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,520
minimal and hierarchical is vulnerable

159
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,280
to down coding attacks these attacks

160
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,479
work when everything's a quasi

161
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,220
identifier and therefore work against

162
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,100
all of those techniques I listed

163
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,020
not just canonimity

164
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,419
we also show that these down coding

165
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,039
attacks can give you predicate signaling

166
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,039
now it attacks which uh uh

167
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,020
um together suggests that these

168
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,319
techniques uh minimal hierarchical Canon

169
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm going to just failed to anonymize

170
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,979
into the gdpr

171
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,680
and in practice re-identifies uh

172
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,560
students in an edx data set so it's a

173
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
real world attack on a on a data set

174
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,759
published according to uh strix privacy

175
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,020
regulations

176
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,020
so that's the contributions I'm going to

177
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,280
just go through this from the beginning

178
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,800
to the end very quickly I've five

179
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,960
minutes

180
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,039
and and try to understand it so down

181
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,780
coding attacks so what's the down coding

182
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,800
attack

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,479
um here's the data set on the left

184
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,520
here's on the right is a three

185
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,139
anonymized version of the data set and

186
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,840
again for the rest of the talk

187
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,400
for the theory part of the talk I'm

188
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,840
going to consider everything to be a

189
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,880
quasi-identifier okay

190
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,979
so on the right is a three anonymized

191
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,660
version

192
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,699
that's it this in the middle is a down

193
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,060
coding so what is it it's a it still

194
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,160
generalizes the original data set on the

195
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,380
left but it refines the data set on the

196
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,940
right so if you look at the the

197
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,039
highlighted row uh you know it's

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,860
recovered some more granular

199
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,500
um a salary information

200
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,900
and in particular the data set in the

201
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,360
middle is not at all

202
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,039
K Anonymous anymore

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,900
and that's not an accident because if

204
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,000
the data set on the right is minimal

205
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,860
then any way in which you make it more

206
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,580
specific is going to violate anonymity

207
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,780
does that make sense

208
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,580
hopefully that makes sense

209
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,500
so that's what down coding is you should

210
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,419
think about it as undoing generalization

211
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,400
we're going to push the data set down

212
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,740
the hierarchy

213
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,280
uh so how is this possible here's a very

214
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,979
simple cartoon uh this is all I'm going

215
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,319
to show you about the techniques so

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,000
suppose you have this sort of a data set

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,759
if you know that the mechanism that

218
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,220
anonymized this data set is minimal then

219
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,740
you also know that every column has at

220
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,020
least one one and one zero

221
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,940
because otherwise that column would not

222
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,740
have been redacted

223
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,740
right so you can guess that maybe that

224
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,299
one's a one and that one's a zero and

225
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,279
then you sort of run into a wall because

226
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,539
you don't know where the ones and the

227
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,679
zeros go

228
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,599
but maybe you know that being old and

229
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,880
being retired are correlated so you can

230
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
start to guess uh where the ones and the

231
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,180
zeros go

232
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,580
this is like a very simple cartoon but

233
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,160
uh you know if you push these ideas like

234
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,980
all the way you get a two-step approach

235
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,560
to proving the theorem step one is you

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,600
prove some sort of structural result

237
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,820
that every minimal anonymizer must

238
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,899
satisfy

239
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,779
uh and step two is you uh you know

240
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,100
leverage properties of a data

241
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,060
distribution

242
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,980
so what do we show is that there are

243
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,019
settings in which every minimal

244
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,880
hierarchical can anonymizer enables

245
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
strong down coding attacks with high

246
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,519
probability

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
so what's a setting a setting is a data

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,779
distribution and a hierarchy so the

249
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,820
distribution is you know here on the

250
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,800
right it's some sort of gaussian mixture

251
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,720
distribution it depends on K

252
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,899
what do I mean by strong I mean that you

253
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,140
can you can down code you can refine

254
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,920
um a linear number of rows so more than

255
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,860
three percent for any for reasonable k

256
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,560
um and you can refine about 40 of the

257
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,920
columns

258
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,180
and this is any minimal hierarchical k

259
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,719
anonymizer

260
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,880
uh so that's the theorem you can also

261
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,620
push these parameters if you're willing

262
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,320
to work with a less natural distribution

263
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,019
uh and the result directly challenges

264
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,660
the core tenet of the identification

265
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,880
which the core tenant is that if

266
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,560
everything is a quasi identifier then

267
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,420
can anonymity gives you something

268
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,600
meaningful uh and the result implies

269
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,540
that that depends on unstated and

270
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,940
unknown distributional assumptions that

271
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,740
have never been pointed out and never

272
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,060
been observed

273
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,399
um and never been admitted to by by

274
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,100
proponents of the identification

275
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,600
uh

276
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,800
okay now uh connecting it to policy uh

277
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,660
predicate signaling it out attacks were

278
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,060
proposed in some in in Prior work of of

279
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,940
mine and my collaborators to bridge math

280
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,779
and law uh and and the argument is that

281
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,899
predicate singling out attacks enable uh

282
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,399
something called singling out in the

283
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,420
gdpr and gdpr Regulatory documents and

284
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,940
that signaling out implies a failure to

285
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,000
anonymize on their gdpr

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,220
and so the idea is that anything that

287
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,380
enables predicate singling out also

288
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,500
suggests a failure to anonymize

289
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm short on time so I'm not going to

290
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,459
define a predicate signaling out attacks

291
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,380
only to say that

292
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,899
um uh we sort of greatly improve the

293
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,459
attacks that were that were proposed in

294
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,560
the prior work and these sort of

295
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,680
directly challenge current EU guidelines

296
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,620
on canonimity which may be not current

297
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,959
in the near future

298
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,820
um I don't know I don't have particular

299
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,680
knowledge

300
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,519
um

301
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
and lastly I have

302
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,019
I was shooting for 12 minutes the timer

303
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,540
was a little less than 12 minutes so I'm

304
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,700
going to take one more minute

305
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,040
um I will tell you about the practice so

306
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,260
here's the data set it was published by

307
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,260
edx uh but really by Harvard and MIT it

308
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,820
had half a million students downloaded

309
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,720
tens of 10 000 times and it was

310
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,700
de-anonymized uh by you know Harvard

311
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,680
General Council

312
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,339
professors and postdocs and stats and CS

313
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,420
um in order to satisfy FERPA

314
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,000
and they used can anonymity

315
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,140
the data included demographic

316
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,519
information and how well people

317
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,160
performed on the edx courses edx is like

318
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,560
an online course platform

319
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
um if you think about this data you

320
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,820
think well maybe a recruiter

321
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,740
you know somebody who's looking at a job

322
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,540
resume might know demographic

323
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,100
information and might know how well you

324
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,899
did on your edx courses if you put it on

325
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,700
your resume

326
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,480
if you look at these data

327
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,339
a third of the data a third of the

328
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,420
people who were in certificates are

329
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,519
uniques and about two percent of them

330
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,860
are what I call an Ambiguously unique

331
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,200
see the paper and also failed an adx

332
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,420
course

333
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,220
and you realize that you don't have to

334
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,720
be a job recruiter you can just look at

335
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,760
people's LinkedIn because people post

336
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,860
their edx data on LinkedIn and their

337
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,440
demographic information

338
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,260
so with 120 you can get a recruiter

339
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,420
account re-identify some people we

340
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,519
re-identified three after some manual

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,720
searching

342
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,000
and so to summarize we introduced down

343
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,100
coding show that every minimal

344
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,899
hierarchical mechanism is vulnerable to

345
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,000
down coding and and by uh leveraging

346
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,779
those to predicate signal not attacks

347
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:16,680
um

348
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,720
and the conclusion is that

349
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,700
de-identification fails even if every

350
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,180
attribute is quasi-identifying

351
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,040
and fails to meet regulatory goals even

352
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,920
when used by experts

353
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,139
the open question is you know go from

354
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,639
this particular example of some

355
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,200
distribution to a general classification

356
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,639
of distributions

357
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,779
that allow these attacks

358
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,540
thank you
