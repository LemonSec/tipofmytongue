00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,040
hello my name is Kate lamonians I'm an

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,540
assistant professor at Utrecht

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,540
University International today I'm going

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,000
to present our work on the anatomy of

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
people mental models among professionals

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,160
working in a corporation

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,080
this is John at work with my colleagues

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,000
from the Delta University of Technology

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,359
Max plant Institute for informatics

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,759
c-spot and right about University

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,520
a VPN stands for virtual product Network

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,980
this technology provides a secure

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,719
connection to a physically distant

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,800
Network

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,140
the VPN technology is an effective

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,600
solution to counter censorship gear

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,420
filtering state level surveillance and

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,219
threats of insecure local internet

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,539
access

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,640
these days we can see the bloom of

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,219
commercial VPN providers an increase in

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,160
the adoption of VPN by end users

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,739
and end user's perspective is well

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,860
covered in recent studies however these

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,020
studies do not consider the business and

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,119
corporate users

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,280
in the past two years we all went

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,340
through the covid-19 pandemic and had to

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,380
adjust our working practices to home

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,280
settings

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,460
field medical found out that the VPN

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,439
traffic increased by two times during

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,659
the first lockdown compared to the real

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,340
amounts

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,979
DPS as a main solution in a corporate

36
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,979
context to manage ahead and connector

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,080
notebook stations to the internal

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,900
network of the company

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,000
and it's a data handled by corporate

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,600
vpns may be a highly sensitive and

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,520
confidential so it is important to

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,500
understand

43
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,900
and determine how Corporate users and

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,840
see the VPN technology and how they use

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,579
it

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,520
to study the perspective of veganisms in

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,979
professional context we formulated the

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,619
following research questions first how

49
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,200
when why do or do not corporate users

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,600
use vpns how does the same creepy

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,880
networks and finally have them they see

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,919
the impact of Defense on this reference

53
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,140
key so what kind of stress can be

54
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,060
mitigating but also okay and what kind

55
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,220
of stress can be introduced into VPN

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,900
usage

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,300
as corporate users we study two groups

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,400
of employees train ID professionals

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
hoping additionally key or security

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,500
related qualifications and non-experts

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,140
from non-atilimated departments in

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,260
non-technical roles for example HR and

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,060
finance

64
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,400
to answer our research questions we

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,980
decided to explore the mental models of

66
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,200
experts and non-experts working in a

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,060
corporate firm

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,519
a mental model represents how Samsung

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,040
works in the real world according to

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,099
someone's thought process or perception

71
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,200
and to listen the mental model of our

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,959
participants we combine two techniques

73
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,080
we conducted semi-structured interviews

74
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,660
to learn how a participants reason about

75
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,000
different concepts around VPN and what

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,819
relationships they see between them

77
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,980
in addition we ask our participle to do

78
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,580
the drawing task and help them that help

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,099
them to visualize the mental models and

80
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,280
think along with this visual

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,900
visualization process

82
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,819
for the drawing task we ask our

83
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,739
participants to use three scenarios of

84
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,099
VPN usage from home office a particle

85
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,379
Cafe where you can connect to the public

86
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,379
Wi-Fi hotspot in the case of checking

87
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,140
emails via as a corporate VPN

88
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,819
at the bottom of the slide you can see

89
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,280
an example of the drawing made by one of

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
our experts they visualize the VPN is a

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,440
shield between a working laptop and a

92
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,780
corporate Network

93
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,239
to analyze data we hold according

94
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,340
process inspired by the grounded Theory

95
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,860
approach and included open Excel and

96
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,659
selective coding and finally model

97
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,599
generation in our case rental model

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,420
generation to control the codebook

99
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,599
reliability to authors and independent

100
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,400
recorded three interviews to ensure that

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,860
we interpreted data in the same way

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,780
and after resolving improvements we

103
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,320
achieved treatment wasn't 0.8 which

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,079
indicates a reliable code rule

105
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,540
the final call book included 86 clothes

106
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,320
in total and we grouped there into four

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,940
core scenes answering our research

108
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,979
questions

109
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,960
we recruited our participants from a

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,520
Dutch office of a professional

111
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,259
consulting firm

112
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,900
offering a wide range of services from

113
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,300
Financial auditing to its security

114
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,979
assessments

115
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,979
we introduced seven non-experts who had

116
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,020
worked in the company in average six

117
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,040
years and we introduced 11 experts and

118
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,979
this group had worked in the company for

119
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,860
four years on average

120
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,259
the vpns is the use of the company is

121
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,060
supplied by a major Network device

122
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,360
vendor the employees are using a custom

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
white label plant so it appears for them

124
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,160
if it would be a product of the company

125
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,620
so same corporate Style

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,440
this VPN uses the complete tunnel

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,199
connection meaning that all traffic is

128
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,620
sent by us at EPL connection

129
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,860
next I discuss the results of our study

130
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,780
here you can see a mental model of

131
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,139
non-experts of how a VPN works and on

132
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,039
what devices our participants use

133
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,139
the VPN connection

134
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,180
so no experts showed a basic

135
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,759
understanding of how VPN works and in

136
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,400
general they described same process for

137
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,919
establishing a VPN connection

138
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,139
the connect first they connect to the

139
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,960
Internet Launch the VPN software then

140
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,380
enter credentials and confirmities and

141
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,400
two-factor token

142
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,160
and then click connect button in the VPN

143
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,880
software

144
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,500
experts describes a similar process of

145
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,780
how to start the VPN connection

146
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,720
hello experts and non-experts

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,240
were uncertain about when to use the VPN

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,820
some of them reported that they do not

149
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,880
use a VPN in Risky situations

150
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,340
they assume that using VPN might make

151
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,280
them more of a Target due to new threats

152
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
they see

153
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,060
but at a high level the experts have a

154
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,259
similar idea about how repair works and

155
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,120
but what we can say is that they

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,340
provided a more detailed mental model of

157
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,199
retail infrastructure

158
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,000
the included in the explanations

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,560
Concepts like

160
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,139
um external education and authorization

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,400
um aspects of the corporate Network

162
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,220
topologies limitations specifically as I

163
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,139
mentioned the use of demilitarized zone

164
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,240
Now we move to the threats model that

165
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,120
our participants have around using a VPN

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,240
with this icon

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,940
we denote a threats introduced by the

168
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,960
VPN and this one is a green shield note

169
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,560
3s mitigated by

170
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
due to use of VPN

171
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,660
we found that threat models of

172
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,360
non-experts follow their tunnel metaphor

173
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,220
so what does it mean

174
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,080
once you start the weekend connection

175
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,880
the information is secured in this

176
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,900
tunnel

177
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,000
admitting in specific threats leaving

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
them outside of the tunnel as for new

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,099
threats our proceedment also consider

180
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,740
the VPN service itself as a Potential

181
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,000
Threat

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,819
for example direct attacks on the VPN

183
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,919
server and compromised endpoint when it

184
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,340
is connected via VPN

185
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,319
in addition to the basic stress

186
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,419
simplified by non-experts the experts

187
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,639
also identify threats from a more

188
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,220
operational perspective

189
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,660
experts also consider it better control

190
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,020
and device management capabilities due

191
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,819
to the VPN as a part of the stress

192
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,099
mitigated by VPN

193
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,860
they notice that systems connected via

194
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,720
VPN could be better monitors and

195
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,520
incorporate security policies could be

196
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
better enforced so for example as I

197
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,780
mentioned monitoring client software

198
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,539
update State and passing user Network

199
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,759
topics to corporate intrusion detection

200
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,680
system

201
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,520
and what surprises this point relates to

202
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
the Privacy threads introduced by VPN

203
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,219
mentioned by our experts we had privacy

204
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,899
concerns

205
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,479
but still these mitigations are also not

206
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,520
necessarily related to VPN itself

207
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,760
instead the additional services

208
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,940
among new threats for expert

209
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,980
participants in addition to non-expert

210
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,800
uh mentioned was the first stolen

211
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,380
credentials

212
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,180
based on the mental models of our

213
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,399
participants we made several

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,700
recommendations for practitioners the

215
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,640
first is to automate VPN and make it its

216
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
usage visible and default for employees

217
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,940
and second to accommodate the degree of

218
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,860
private VPN used in the company's

219
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,380
privacy policy and actually communicate

220
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,839
these changes to the employees

221
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,640
next we suggest exploring device

222
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,220
management solutions to the low secure

223
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,980
work even without the VPN

224
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,680
and finally Focus related training on

225
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,839
what employees need to know based on the

226
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,100
mental models

227
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,380
because we discovered that even

228
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,420
non-experts have a basic understanding

229
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,459
of how a VPN work

230
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,279
also using metaphors like title or shoot

231
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,600
and could improve training accessibility

232
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,459
in the bottom of the slide you can see

233
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,820
an example of drawing is trading the

234
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,459
terminal metaphor used by one of our

235
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,440
participants

236
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,779
for future research we suggest further

237
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,540
exploring the privacy concerns raised by

238
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,279
our experts in the application to

239
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,760
privately used vpns and it seems that

240
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,500
the end users tend to trust commercial

241
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,899
VPN providers more than the localized

242
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,339
piece

243
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,440
so it's an important question for future

244
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,660
research to explore the trust

245
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,240
relationships between end users and

246
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,220
their localized piece

247
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,339
for this purpose our mental models of

248
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,000
non-experts can Surface a basis

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,220
another possible direction is

250
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,740
quantitatively study the use of vpns

251
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,980
must Incorporated in private contexts to

252
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,260
get a more General perspective and

253
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,120
finally we encourage and quickly

254
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,519
validate the interventions in line with

255
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,100
our recommendations using controlled

256
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,899
experiments

257
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,779
in summary we found that both experts

258
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,760
and non-experts have a similar

259
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,339
understanding of retained technology and

260
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,079
a high level

261
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,540
however the experts have a more certain

262
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,779
technical comprehension of the VPN they

263
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,640
also Express concerns regarding the

264
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,680
Privacy implications of using a

265
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,180
corporate VPN

266
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,260
and what surprises us our experts also

267
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,480
associate with DPS is Fleet Management

268
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,000
and policy enforcement

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,519
so following our findings we suggest

270
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,079
exploring the possibilities for

271
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,920
automating VPN usage improving privacy

272
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,140
policy and its communication

273
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,959
and adopting Technical Training to what

274
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,120
people are missing based on their mental

275
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,959
models and use metaphors to make these

276
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
trainings accessible

277
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,880
thank you for thank you for your

278
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,220
attention and I'm looking forward to

279
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,940
your questions
