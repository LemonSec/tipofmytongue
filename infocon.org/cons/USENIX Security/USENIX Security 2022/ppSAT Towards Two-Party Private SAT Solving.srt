my name is ning I'm PhD student at El

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,940
today I'm going to present our work to

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,160
party private style solving this is the

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,500
joint work we send timos rudika and

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,020
Michelle

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,460
is a fundamental problem in computer

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,160
science it has broad applications such

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
as bioinformatics Circle synthesized

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,500
software verification Hardware equations

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,040
checking air traffic control and Etc

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,020
in general we can encode the problem

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,180
arising from this field as a burning

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,059
formula and send it to a test over after

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,160
getting the output of the test server we

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,860
can decode the result and obtain the

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,860
solution to the original problem

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,020
despite the fact that they're solving is

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,360
anti-companied problem modern says so

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,640
right now can resolve large and complex

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,920
set instance that contains minions

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,559
variable and clauses

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,680
in practice the input formula of a

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,960
thesaurus can confirm multiple parties

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,740
for example in BIO in bioinformatics two

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,040
parties says Anis and Bob they need to

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,080
resolve the negate the conjunction of

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
their input formula

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
if they trust each other then they can

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,619
compute the conjunction of their input

31
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,140
formula and invoke a cell server as a

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,380
user however their their input formula

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,939
usually contains a lot of information

34
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,820
about the genotype and the genotype

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,579
carries significant privacy risk in this

36
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,280
case Anis and Bob have strong motivation

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,100
to keep their input formula private when

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,439
they are input formula are private the

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,020
conjunction of their input formula is

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,200
also private this private formula is

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,899
beyond on the existence beyond the

42
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,259
capability of exists as a server our

43
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,540
work privacy preserving self-solving

44
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,720
proposed a PVC server to address this

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,619
problem

46
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,100
all PPC server enable two parties to

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,280
input their in secret formula over a

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,459
public set of variables and PVC server

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,879
will output onset if the conjunction of

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,400
their input formula always evalued to

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,099
force or set if there is a variable

52
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,200
assignment that make their conjunction

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,319
of the input formula eventually to

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,319
moreover as its name indicates or PVC

55
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,500
server provides enhanced privacy in the

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,840
sense that it will hide the input

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,540
participants input formula from each

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,099
other

59
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,120
in the rest my my talk I will first

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
introduce bunions and solving in the

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,140
plant text and the cryptography tools we

62
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,620
use in this work and then avoid span or

63
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,800
construction for PVC server finally I

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,959
will bring some discussion about our

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,940
future work

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,519
bunions the solving take a formula as an

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,340
input in this work we focus on seeing a

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,480
formula

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,300
give us a formula Boolean self-solving

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,780
will output set or onset depends on if

71
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,180
there exists a variable assignment that

72
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,760
make the formula eventually true in the

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,920
example in the example formula of this

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,340
Slide the formula is satisfiable and the

75
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,840
variable assignments that make this

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,140
formula satisfiable is listed here

77
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,500
in literature dpil is a is a classical

78
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,019
procedure to bonus cell solving I will

79
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,720
explain dpil using a rounding example

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,599
let's look at this input formula we will

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,780
find a very special clause which is not

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,780
X1 this cross is very special because it

83
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,940
contains only one liter rope we call

84
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,120
this Nitro unit literal since this cross

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,700
contains only node X1 we immediately

86
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,700
know that x1's value has to be forced we

87
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,280
assign Force to X1 and simplify the

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,239
formula

89
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,760
for the same reason we know X we can

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,700
assign 2 to X2 and simplify the formula

91
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,640
further now we come to a point where

92
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,879
there is no unit initial so we need to

93
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,019
take a guess our gas value is false and

94
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,320
this gas leads to a conflict so I need

95
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,358
to jump back and flip my guess and

96
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,360
continue finally we got a model to the

97
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,300
original to the input formula so we know

98
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,479
the input formula is satisfiable

99
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,240
in summary there are five basic

100
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,699
operations that we need for dpil

101
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,040
procedure you need to need to research

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,100
that finds this unit's natural

103
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,139
propagation that simplifies the formula

104
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,540
on the variable assignments the station

105
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,780
that this uh that enable us to make a

106
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,000
guess when there is no units neutral

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
check let's decide if the formula

108
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,220
evaluative force or two on the variable

109
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,979
assignment and the backtrack whenever we

110
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,259
come to a conflict and need to jump back

111
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,780
and finish our gas

112
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,300
designing a privacy preserving size

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,180
server is challenging because it's hard

114
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,759
to design data Optimus execution for

115
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,460
dpil procedure exists the implementation

116
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,160
and data structure are highly data

117
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,280
dependent even for the basic even for

118
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,380
the basic operation

119
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,100
um

120
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,500
on the other hand to PC computation

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,800
requires data of news execution to

122
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,259
prevent information leakage in this work

123
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,500
we use two cryptography tools to obtain

124
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,780
enhancer privacy the first one is double

125
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,479
circuit double circuit enables two-party

126
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,880
CQ computation so that two-party can

127
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,120
evaluate over over or evaluate the

128
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,699
function over their private input we

129
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,520
also use open email stack of new stack

130
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,639
provide private operation over the stack

131
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,820
we use pop and push operation and the

132
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,220
mobiles operations are conditional

133
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,860
operation it means it will take this

134
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,780
operation will take a secret Boolean

135
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,419
variable as the input and this variable

136
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,880
indicates whether the operation actually

137
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,979
occurs or not

138
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,680
now we have all things we need to

139
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,020
explain the construction of our previous

140
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,600
solver I will begin with the data

141
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,600
structure for ex for expressing the

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,319
signal formula we use the Matrix to

143
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,900
represent or input the same as formula

144
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,860
each row of this Matrix corresponds to a

145
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,500
variable and Each corner of this Matrix

146
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,539
corresponds to a cross

147
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,600
if the variable appears in corresponding

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Clause then when the entry will be one

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
if the negation of the variable appears

150
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,060
in corresponding cross then the value of

151
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,699
-1 otherwise the value will be zero

152
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,340
it turns out that units need to research

153
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,699
propagation and check can be all encoded

154
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,300
as a linear scan over its Matrix we

155
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,639
further Implement decision and

156
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,500
backtracking using open email stack

157
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,020
whenever we want to make a guess we need

158
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,600
to put a current Barb assignment and

159
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,300
orgas into the stack whenever will come

160
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,360
to a conflict come to a conflict and you

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,880
need to flip our guess we will pop out

162
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,759
elements from the stack and flip the gas

163
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,419
now we have open reviews variant for all

164
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,819
these five basic operations the next

165
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,099
question is how can we compose them

166
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,419
together

167
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,720
dplo in the plan text before a given

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,819
input formula will result in a search

169
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,280
entry and the structure of this

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,139
searching tree will reveal a lot of

171
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,259
information about the input formula we

172
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,599
prevent this part of information leakage

173
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
by enforcing joint step essentially all

174
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,919
PP set server consists of a sequence of

175
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,400
Giant Steps each joint step will take an

176
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,139
encrypted formula and a variable

177
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,319
assignment as input and output of

178
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,479
formula and the updated formula and

179
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,039
variable assignment that is still

180
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,099
encrypted moreover the output of a giant

181
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,340
step or will be the input of next joint

182
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,720
set

183
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,259
within a giant step we will execute five

184
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,919
basic operations in a fixed order some

185
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,379
of the operations will be dummy so we

186
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,379
use multiplexer to select output and

187
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,479
ensure the correctness

188
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,240
now we have almost everything for

189
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,820
constructing a test server but only one

190
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,599
component missing that is heuristic

191
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,159
heuristics tell us how to make a good

192
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,979
guess when we need to do decision and

193
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,380
heuristic usually is the core of a set

194
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,940
server

195
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,180
in all overall PP cell solver we provide

196
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,060
three heuristic the first one is a

197
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,760
deterministic one it's called the IRS it

198
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,860
will select the most commonly appearing

199
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,680
initial with the smallness index

200
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,740
the second one is a randomized heuristic

201
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,040
it will uniformly select a random and

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,339
undecided neutral and the last one is

203
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,980
weighted random heuristic it will select

204
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,040
the random undecided neutral with bias

205
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,700
and this bias is a proportional to its

206
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,760
frequency in the formula for example in

207
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,700
the in the formula of this slides the

208
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,339
this weight is a random heuristic will

209
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,459
guess x0 is true with one over six

210
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,160
chance and we'll get X to X zeros value

211
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
is fourth with 2 over 6 chains and Etc

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
now we have a test server we also have

213
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,399
some heuristics let's see what is

214
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,980
performance in practice

215
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,060
we Implement our PP set server using EMP

216
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,000
and evaluator or on this test bat the

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,580
first result I want to show you is this

218
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,420
the one time course of one giant step M

219
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,580
and N are the number of Clauses and

220
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,459
variable respectively as you can see the

221
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,980
time cost of backtrack is almost

222
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,100
negligible compared with time cost of

223
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,220
other operations moreover the decision

224
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,480
where we make her guess about undecided

225
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
undecided variables value

226
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,220
dominates the performance of each giant

227
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,420
step

228
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,779
we also Benchmark our paper set server

229
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,540
against the real database we use

230
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,820
international human hypotype and

231
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,740
genotype data set and there are 232 set

232
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,080
instances in total and this gist value

233
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,620
is a parameter to of this formula the

234
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,779
larger G is the larger formula the

235
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,700
larger the formula will be

236
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,060
and as you can see when G is more and

237
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,480
the formula is simple a deterministic

238
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,940
heuristics how to perform the residue

239
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,180
randomized heuristic however when G

240
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,040
become larger and the formula become

241
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
larger and more complicated weighted

242
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
random heuristic Auto performs the other

243
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,160
two heuristics and moreover it takes for

244
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,040
some instance with all PVC solver cannot

245
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,380
solve some of the instance even with a

246
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,640
week

247
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,420
okay now let's talk about the future

248
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,320
um

249
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,680
let me be honest first we indeed compare

250
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,320
our work with the state of the art set

251
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,779
solver in the plain text

252
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,860
um

253
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,959
it turned out that for some of the

254
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,720
incidents we need a week to solve can be

255
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,300
solved by state-of-the-art set instance

256
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,500
within 0.02 seconds but I want to make a

257
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,779
remark here that

258
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,180
um self-solving that's over in the

259
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,100
sensor in the

260
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,120
plantex involves over 30 years

261
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,920
theoretical and Engineering efforts

262
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,620
while all work is the first attempt to

263
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,720
solving their solving to solving that

264
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,660
solver to solving set problem in privacy

265
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,220
preserving setting

266
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,200
to make our our to make our PVC server

267
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,019
closer to Modern self-solving the plant

268
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,560
hacks or next step is implementing more

269
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,380
advanced heuristic we are in

270
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,399
particularly interested in cdcl which is

271
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,640
short for closed conflict driven close

272
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,420
and learning cdcl can learn new Clauses

273
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,079
from failed branch and cdcl is also the

274
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,100
core of success of modern set solver

275
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,000
we also considering using our PVC server

276
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,640
to solve problems in practice we have

277
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,860
ongoing work about inter-domain

278
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,620
verification where we use privacy prison

279
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,160
test server to enable autonomous systems

280
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,160
in network to come to verify the network

281
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,320
without reviewing what's their

282
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,540
configuration file is

283
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,480
in summary in this work we propose

284
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,579
privacy preserving self-solving problem

285
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,220
and

286
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,440
provide the first solution to it we

287
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,019
believe efficient privacy said solving

288
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,779
will be a powerful tool due to solving

289
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,660
so fundamental in computer science

290
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,940
moreover there are many many interesting

291
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,579
research problems to make us a PVC

292
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,760
server as practical as the server in the

293
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,519
plan text thank you I'm willing to take

294
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,060
any question
