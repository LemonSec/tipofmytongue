1
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,800
uh hello everyone I'm Sergio from

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,259
Michigan State University today I would

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,179
like to share our collaboration work

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,960
with my advisor Dr chibanyan Dr yanshu

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,260
and Dr Lee chosen from Lehigh University

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,140
titled double star long range attack

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,180
towards depth estimation based obstacle

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,279
avoidance in Autumn's driving system

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,620
there are different autonomous driving

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,320
system noted nowadays such as drones

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,780
Optimus driving vehicles and robotic

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,100
cars for the Safety and Security reason

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,920
obstacle detection and avoidance play an

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,360
important role

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,059
there are different type of sensors in

16
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,120
the Autumn's driving system such as Lida

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,820
radar camera and ultrasonic sensor

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
cameras are especially

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,160
popular due to its low cost and wide

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,440
usage there are two types of cameras

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,920
monical camera and stereo camera a

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,799
manicular camera has a single lens and a

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,380
single image sensor whereas a stereo

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,479
camera is a type of camera with two

25
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,060
lenses and a separate image sensor for

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,040
each lens

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,780
um there are some recent work trying to

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,900
attack cameras contactless attack use

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,180
laser to make the denial service attack

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,659
ghost image use a projector to inject an

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,360
image into a camera and Split Second

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,060
Phantom attacks project the image to the

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,280
physical world to food object detection

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,299
system

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,939
besides some recent work also tried to

36
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,520
attack drones one type of attack use

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,380
acoustic signal to interfere the eye

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,320
meal on one on the drum leading to a

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
denial service attack the attack

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,240
distance is around 10 centimeter the

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,700
other type of attack is trying to

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,720
continuously control the drone over

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,000
using uh attacking its downward facing

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
camera

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,659
the attacking distance is around three

46
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,119
centimeters three meters

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,520
however there are some limitations of

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,580
the existing work first all existing

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,440
attacks towards autonomous vehicles

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,920
Target molecular cameras therefore in

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,660
this work we are trying to attack

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,360
sterile cameras and the antenna identify

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
the stereo cameras vulnerabilities

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,700
second all drone attacks have limited

55
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,520
attack range in this work we propose

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,260
double star to control drones

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,480
continuously over a long range

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,840
so what is double star double star is

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,879
the first black box and long range

60
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,519
attack against stero variant based depth

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,739
estimation in obstacle avoidance system

62
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,319
on autonomous systems

63
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,319
before I go into the attack design I

64
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,819
would like to introduce some background

65
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,739
knowledge of stero variant base depth

66
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,680
estimation stero variant based in

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,980
estimation are borrowed idea from the

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,319
human binocular variant as you can see

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,340
in this figure object p and object Q are

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,980
since a different location of the retina

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,260
resulting in the different depth of the

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,720
two objects similar to the human

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,659
binocular variant stereo camera has left

74
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,700
and right image based on the

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,920
triangulation we can mathematically

76
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,680
calculate the depth of an object which

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
denoted as Z here in the third figure

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,580
however sterile variant base depth

79
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,860
estimation are not exactly the same as

80
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,500
the human perception it often matches

81
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,099
the similar features such as shapes

82
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,500
colors with high confidence and sterile

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,099
correspondence here is an example in the

84
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,220
left and right images I manually add a

85
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,580
meaningless image Patch It causes a fake

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,040
depth in the depth image

87
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,500
besides there is an interesting effect

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,959
in the optical Imaging which is called

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,019
lens flare effect lens flare effect is a

90
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,000
phenomena caused by the scattering and

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,700
reflecting of a bright light through a

92
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,099
non-ideal lens system there are several

93
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,980
undesired artifacts appear on an image

94
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,139
here is an example

95
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,260
the light source is sensed by the symbol

96
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,380
sensor however at the same time the

97
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,960
light is scattered and reflected

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,100
multiple times and caused a green small

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,160
up on decimal sensor as well this is

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,259
what we call lens flare effect

101
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,860
here is an example in the real life this

102
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,300
is a light source which we call clear

103
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,840
um here and this is a light source the

104
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
other one is orb which is caused by the

105
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,620
lens flare effect we also investigate

106
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,600
investigated using the different attack

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,139
angle and attack distance we still can

108
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,380
say the orb in the third and in the

109
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,780
second and the third figures

110
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,020
besides we noticed that the clear and

111
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,080
the orb has the relationship which is

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,600
their coordination a central symmetric

113
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,120
with each other for example if the clear

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
has a coordination of A and B then it's

115
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,540
the orbs will have the coordination of

116
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,479
minus a and minus B now let's look at

117
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,820
the design of the double star attack the

118
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,740
basic idea of double star attack is

119
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,780
using two light source to project to the

120
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,960
stereo camera to create fake depth we

121
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,360
have two type of vertex here the first

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,699
type is called beans attack which is

123
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,740
based on the glares as we introduced

124
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,800
before the second one is called orbs

125
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,520
attack this is based on the orbs uh we

126
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
also designed three type of attack

127
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,139
patterns and I'll introduce them one by

128
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,840
one the first attack pattern is called

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,560
xgp attack we have light source p and Q

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,680
and A Sterile camera here p is pointing

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,620
to the right camera while Q is aiming at

132
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,180
the left camera

133
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,820
the original Circle represents the

134
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,100
appearance of the injected light which

135
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,500
is clear as we show in the previous

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,340
figure and the dotted wet Circle stands

137
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,020
for the position of the light source

138
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,660
which is not aiming at the camera as a

139
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,039
result the Q in the left image will

140
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,460
match with the p in the right image as

141
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,919
the sterile correspondence this is what

142
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,620
we captured in the real life this is p

143
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,720
and Q as a result we can have a big

144
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
depth in the depth map

145
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,460
and we also can clearly see the fake

146
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,740
obstacle in the 3D Pawn cloud

147
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,139
the second attack pattern is the trapezo

148
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,360
ship attack in the attacks in this

149
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
attack scenario p is targeting to the

150
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,300
left left camera whereas Q is pointing

151
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,660
to the right camera therefore p in the

152
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,620
left image will become very brighter and

153
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,199
Q in the right image will become very

154
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,460
brighter and Central symmetrically there

155
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,280
will be an orbs happens in the left and

156
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,479
right image

157
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,699
this is what we captured in the real

158
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,160
life these two orbs will match each

159
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
other with a stereo correspondence and

160
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,380
output and thick depth here

161
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,599
this is what we can see in the 3D pump

162
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,240
Cloud a fake obstacle is created

163
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,580
the last attack pattern is the triangle

164
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,800
Ship Attack

165
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,419
triangle shift is attack is trying to

166
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,120
use the p and Q covering the left and

167
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
the right cameras at the same time

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,919
ideally it should like look like this

169
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,160
however when we project the light to the

170
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,099
stereo camera we can observe a huge

171
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,560
coverage area of the light

172
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,080
so in this case we cannot guarantee

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,060
exactly the same amount of light

174
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,039
covering the two cameras at the same

175
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,099
time as a result the attack will be

176
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,400
transferred into this or this

177
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,919
so

178
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,000
this is the three type of attack

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,419
and now let's simulate our attack using

180
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,479
the Urdu pilot and RSM RCM is an

181
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,699
autonomous system simulator created by

182
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,039
the Microsoft which is used to collect

183
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
virtual environment data in our

184
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,780
simulation and autopilot is a popular

185
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,479
drone project which is used to simulate

186
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,940
double star on the drum this is a normal

187
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,919
normal communication between the

188
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,740
autopilot and the RCM however in our

189
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,320
simulation I might only put an attack

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,140
phase which we can manipulate the depth

191
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,580
and send back to the ardu pilot to fool

192
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,440
is

193
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,800
is control and behavior

194
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
this is one of our simulation results

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,899
the flying environment shows that there

196
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,200
is no near obstacle alone is flying past

197
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,660
in the autopilot we can say that without

198
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,360
attack the hiding Direction and The

199
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,940
Flying direction are the same however at

200
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,680
the attack starting point we observe a

201
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,519
fake obstacle at its near right

202
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,560
therefore the Drone tries to fly to the

203
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,080
left and avoid the obstacle we also

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,019
demonstrate our attack in other attack

205
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,720
scenarios such as sudden stop and

206
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,600
shaking please refer our paper for more

207
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,980
details

208
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,680
uh we also test our attack physically

209
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,220
this is the experimental setup this is a

210
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,060
DJI drone and the light source projector

211
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,459
this is where the stereo variant sensor

212
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,160
is and we're also testing our attack on

213
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,420
two stereo camera which is z camera and

214
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,899
internet and Intel real sense camera

215
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,140
we first investigate the effect depth

216
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,019
range on the DJI drum the maximum attack

217
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,800
distance we can say is 15 meters at

218
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
night and 8 meters in the day and the

219
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,660
range of the thick depth is 0.5 to 16

220
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,480
meter this range covers all the possible

221
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,060
depth that can be sensed by the DJI

222
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,880
drones obstacle avoidance system which

223
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,920
makes real-time drone control possible

224
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,339
as we demonstrated in our simulation the

225
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,620
fake depth matches with the expected

226
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,260
value for the calculation of the

227
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,779
expected value actually we set up a

228
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,580
mathematical model in our paper as well

229
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,940
please refer our paper for more details

230
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,120
the second thing we investigate is the

231
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,860
range of the attack distance and angle

232
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,800
from the left figure we can see the

233
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,079
stronger projection power leads to

234
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,440
longer attack distance in the second

235
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,040
figure we can say the attack angle is

236
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,440
very wide during the day the maximum

237
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,220
attack angle is around 29 degree and in

238
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,860
the during the night the maximum attack

239
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,760
angle is around 48 degree based on these

240
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,459
two figures we can see the attack at

241
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,120
night is easier than during the day

242
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,760
uh we also attack other state of art

243
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,959
dnm-based stereo depth estimation

244
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,959
we put the real-time collected data to

245
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,380
the sterile uh stereo volume based depth

246
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,380
estimation algorithm and we can say in

247
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,660
the depth map we can successfully create

248
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,360
big depth in the algorithm at most of

249
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,740
the cases

250
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,740
here is one of our attack demonstration

251
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,740
which we are trying to drift away the

252
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,440
Drone from its original path this is a

253
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,160
tech setup DJI drone attacker and the

254
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,220
real depth is 7 meter without the attack

255
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,800
we use the active track mode which allow

256
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,779
the Drone to track a marked moving

257
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,000
object at a constant this distance

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,700
uh you can say the DJI drone is tracing

259
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
the subject normally

260
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,920
however when we start our attack they

261
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,019
think the Drone will be alternated

262
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,899
you can see the attack is start avoiding

263
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,240
obstacle is showing on its control panel

264
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,019
and once the subject is moving the Drone

265
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,240
is drift away to another Direction

266
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,779
because it sends a fixed obstacle

267
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,300
on its original path

268
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,480
in conclusion we present our attack

269
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,959
double star which is a new type of

270
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,579
attack towards the depth estimation

271
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,740
based obstacle avoidance on Autumn's

272
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,019
driving vehicle and drones we also

273
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,480
introduce two types of attack beans

274
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
attack and orbs attack with three

275
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,500
different attack patents in double star

276
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,320
to generate a large range of big depth

277
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,600
we'll also demonstrate our attack on

278
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,760
different devices equipped with sterile

279
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,720
camera which we can achieve up to 15

280
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,360
meters attack distance at night and 8

281
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,040
meter attack distance during the day

282
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,579
with a wide attack angle our future work

283
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,920
will be evaluating our double star

284
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
attack on Autumn's driving vehicles and

285
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,160
the design defense mechanisms

286
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,420
thank you for your listening and I'm

287
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,620
ready to take your questions
