1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,660
this has been a collaboration between

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,820
the University of Glasgow but also the

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,860
Technical University of darmstadt and

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,079
the leibniz University of Hanover and

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,640
our work is called investigating

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,100
state-of-the-art practices for fostering

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,720
subjective trust in online voting

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,400
through interviews

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,920
so I am here at the security conference

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,660
I guess most of you know how online

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,359
voting works just you know let me

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,480
quickly recap it we have a voter they

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,399
have their voting decision and they use

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,739
some kind of system so for instance

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,780
their laptop or their smartphone to cast

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,360
a vote this is then sent online to a

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,280
Ballot Box server where it is stored

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,320
until the end of the election and then

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,239
it is tallied and we can announce the

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,399
result and again I know I'm at a

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,020
security conference there's so many

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,700
things that could go wrong during that

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,980
process but just for a second let's

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,199
assume we would be in a perfect world we

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,379
would have a system that is secure

27
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,019
usable and really easy to understand and

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,420
now in this perfect world what could be

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,000
still a problem so what could lead

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
people to not using our system

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,820
that is subjective trust so if voters

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,860
don't trust the voting system some

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,420
components of it like the voting

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,939
software and the devices the server that

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,100
means they also wouldn't trust the

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,799
result and if the voters won't trust the

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,240
result we basically can Trash our

38
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,280
elections and we don't have to do them

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,320
in the first place so the subjective

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,420
Trust of Voters is a key component in

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,479
online voting and here I would like to

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,040
say the subjective trust is really

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,540
different from these trust assumptions

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,280
that we are making and computationally

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,659
Trust scores

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,420
so in my research we investigated

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,420
measures that the authorities can do to

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,040
help voters determine their subjective

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,960
trust we investigated the research

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,060
question how do state-of-the-art

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,460
practices that aim to help voters

52
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,799
determine their subtractive subjective

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,280
trust indeed impact the voters Trust

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,960
perception so there's a lot of trusted

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,320
questions and perceptions I know

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,720
so first we did a literature review to

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,780
find nine practices to Foster trust I'm

58
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,400
not going to explain them right now but

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,900
I will explain them when I present the

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,800
results

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
we looked at a scientific literature so

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,620
and scientific databases but we also

63
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,300
looked at the official documentation

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,819
from different countries that did online

65
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,360
elections before or they did online

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,400
voting trials or currently introducing

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,220
voting this was really important because

68
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,959
as you can see as a support service for

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,220
voters is something that we wouldn't

70
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,739
have found in the literature

71
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,680
we investigated the trust practices in

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,860
an interview study with 26 participants

73
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,080
we first welcomed them asked them for

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,180
their consent then we asked them for

75
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,220
their voting experiences to also make

76
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,200
sure that these that our participants

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,700
have a consistent voting experience

78
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,280
because it's a German sample we don't

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,819
have any online voting experiences in

80
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,920
politically binding elections but they

81
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,200
have participated in various elections

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,000
like for the city council or for the

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,739
German government

84
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,200
next we familiarize them a bit with

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
online voting by presenting them A

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,860
system that we chose from related work

87
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,319
and also explained components of the

88
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,659
system to them and finally that was the

89
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,700
longest part of the interview we talked

90
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,459
to them about the practices how does a

91
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,840
specific practice impact their

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,940
subjective task have they heard about

93
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,580
this practice from another domain before

94
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,480
and also why does it impact the trust

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,760
and when we analyzed our results we

96
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,440
found four trust clusters so four

97
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,840
categories how these practices impact

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,540
subjective Trust the first one we Call

99
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,879
Mandatory practices those are practices

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,159
where the voters said if that's not the

101
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,900
case for an election I wouldn't

102
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,540
participate at all and this was true for

103
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,459
expert evaluations so we have some

104
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,500
trusted experts like us or some

105
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,140
Authority that would evaluate the source

106
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,599
code and the second mandatory practice

107
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,940
were media information campaigns in the

108
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,159
form of TV or radio sports but also

109
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,319
online the voters could independently

110
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,959
inform about the voting system

111
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,858
the second cluster is given by methods

112
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,260
that enhance trust but it's not

113
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,060
necessary for voters to participate in

114
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,699
the election here we had trial elections

115
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,919
so we use the online voting system in

116
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,680
the fake election before or we have the

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
possibility to access a demo system

118
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,940
without having to give our credentials

119
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,860
and we can just you know familiarize

120
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,360
with the voting system

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,340
the support service for voters that is

122
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,840
used in Switzerland

123
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
um that's like you can call a hotline

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,860
when you need some kind of help that was

125
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,840
also really welcomed and individual

126
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,880
verifiability this is something that has

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,699
been heavily discussed by our community

128
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,100
and that means that voters have the

129
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,860
possibility to verify that the vote is

130
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,240
stored in The Ballot Box from them

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,979
indeed corresponds to what they wanted

132
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,020
to vote for

133
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,080
next we have a bit difficult to explain

134
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,540
like neutral practices here we had like

135
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,000
interesting

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,620
divisions between like different uh

137
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,720
participants here we have open source

138
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
disclosure of the source code here

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
people unfortunately had a lot of

140
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,240
misconceptions so we had a bunch of

141
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,680
computer scientists but we also had

142
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,380
non-experts and the non-experts mainly

143
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,860
thought that disclosing the source code

144
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,600
publicly

145
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,060
makes new like attack vectors possible

146
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,919
and it makes it easier to attack the

147
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,080
voting system which is totally no

148
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,419
different from the way we would expect

149
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,759
we would judge that measure

150
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,800
the second one was Eid authentication

151
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,500
how it is used in Estonia so instead of

152
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,840
like Anonymous credentials and form of a

153
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,759
username or password that cannot be

154
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,000
linked to a person the idea is to have a

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,520
document for a strong eligibility check

156
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,740
but here the participants were also a

157
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,960
bit divided and said like if we're not

158
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,940
using Anonymous credentials or have a

159
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,280
clear separation how can we make sure

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,340
that vote privacy here can be kept

161
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,860
and finally we have negative measures as

162
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,479
you probably would have expected and

163
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,479
that means if that is used people would

164
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,280
probably also abstain from the election

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,100
and not use the voting system at all

166
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,139
here we had different independent

167
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,180
implementations that would mean the

168
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,860
authorities would publish the source

169
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,020
code and I don't know sis bar in Germany

170
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,819
the University of Hanover they could

171
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,280
Implement different voting clients and I

172
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,780
could choose the one I'm trusting the

173
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,560
most

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,500
few participant feared to have a fake

175
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,840
voting software that could spy on them

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,580
or get their credentials and cast a vote

177
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,860
on their behalf and last but not least

178
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,380
we have vote updating that means until

179
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,720
the very end of the election you could

180
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,000
update your vote the idea is that it can

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,340
mitigate coercion so if someone coerces

182
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,639
me to cast a vote for a specific party I

183
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,720
could just do that and log in later

184
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,819
as long as the election hasn't closed so

185
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,080
there's like a little limitation and

186
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,419
then it just casts another vote and here

187
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,740
people say that this is so different

188
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,800
from the paper process in Germany and so

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,340
they really didn't like that

190
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,400
and of course I refer to the paper we

191
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,199
also found a bunch of new practices like

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,060
political Role Models social media and

193
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,520
secure hardware and the misconceptions

194
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,800
there are presented in a little bit more

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,360
depth

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,220
so one of the key takeaways from our

197
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,380
study of first of all these mandatory

198
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,819
practices are well known from other

199
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,120
domains experts evaluations and also

200
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,620
media campaigns is something we know

201
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,120
from our daily life

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,660
and so maybe we can leverage this to

203
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,360
enhance other practices neutral negative

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,160
practices need like additional efforts

205
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,840
so you can't just publish the source

206
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,900
code and just say Okay voters deal with

207
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,660
it so we can combine practices to be

208
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,699
like beneficial and this has been done

209
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,160
in Switzerland so they now have a bounty

210
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,740
hunting program so they published the

211
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,860
code open source and you can look for

212
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,960
um vulnerabilities and I strongly

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
encourage you all to do that you can win

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,960
a lot of money actually

215
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,020
and finally we thought that at least

216
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,819
when you're introducing online voting in

217
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,199
the beginning it should be really

218
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,000
similar to in-person voting in terms of

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
vote updating and other procedures

220
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
so let me conclude what a trust is

221
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,800
crucial in all kinds of Elections

222
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,919
actually and practices that aim to

223
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,419
enhance drugs can actually decrease

224
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,779
trust so we need to leverage known

225
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,760
practices from other domains to enhance

226
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,940
that situation and yeah I'm done and I'm

227
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,959
happy to answer your questions
