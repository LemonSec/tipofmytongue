1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,700
my name is Martin katulliak and today

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,440
I'll be presenting our work l-track

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,540
stealthy tracking of mobile phones in

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,880
LTE and these are joined work of me

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,060
Simon Ernie Patrick Loy Mark rushlin and

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,820
Professor Sergeant Shopkin

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,460
so in LTE networks we have base stations

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,080
and we have mobile phones connecting to

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,539
developed space stations and in our work

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,880
we want to show you how an attacker with

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,059
a limited set of attacking devices can

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,520
basically track all the users

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,239
so what does an attacker needs to do to

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,399
track users first

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,040
he needs a location of all the mobile

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,140
phones and secondly

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,200
he needs identity of those phones

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,100
so l-track is does a stealthy tracking

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,219
using passive vocalization and stealthy

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,899
identification

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,579
so first a bit of background about

23
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,519
physical layer of LTE networks

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,460
so in LT in LTE

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,400
all the information is being sent

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,979
obviously on the through radio interface

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,460
inside the resource grid this resource

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,960
grid is 2D

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,320
in in frequency and time therefore every

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
single resource element

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
so these are the individual squares

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,060
contains some some data if a user wants

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,360
to decode data into it or like address

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,579
to him he first needs to look for this

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,979
downlink dcis

36
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,060
so this DCI blocks contain actually a

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,759
location of the user data and how an

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,400
user can decode those locations so

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,680
essentially user a user B and user C

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,060
they have multiple different dcis

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,920
what about uplink

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
so everything in LTE is managed by the

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,420
base station

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,220
mobile phone cannot just decide right

45
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,259
away to send data on the Uplink

46
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,579
frequencies

47
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,699
he needs to wait for Uplink dcis which

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,199
are settled downlink by the base station

49
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,980
which tell the users where in the uplink

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,400
the user can send the data so these are

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,920
again somehow like the pointers to the

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,680
allocations by the base station

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,660
so in our work we actually build a

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,879
downlink and Uplink sniffer

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,780
which worked by sniffing first the dcis

56
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,760
and then being able using these

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,560
information to decode

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,540
information User information on both

59
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,120
downlink and Uplink our sniffer doesn't

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,700
break encryption but physical layer Mac

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,040
layer are not encrypted therefore we can

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,940
sniff those

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,319
everything in LTE networks is tightly

64
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,760
synchronized

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,440
so what would happen if this was not the

66
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,160
case

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,959
so let's imagine

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,680
um

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,019
debate the base station sends the Uplink

70
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,620
DCI message and it expects to receive

71
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,660
Uplink data exactly four milliseconds

72
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,980
afterwards

73
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,720
however due to the propagation delay

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
this Uplink DCI is going to travel for

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,680
some time and the phone will receive it

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,540
with some delay with some propagation

77
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,099
delay in Delta

78
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,500
after four milliseconds it will sense

79
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,480
the Uplink data and it will arrive to

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,700
the base station again delayed by the

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,620
propagation delay therefore it doesn't

82
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,140
arrive at the expected time but it

83
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,659
arrives four milliseconds plus two times

84
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,360
the propagation delay after upling DCI

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,480
was sent by the base station

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,659
so in the Uplink resource grid this will

87
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,780
turn out to be the user data will be

88
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,819
basically misaligned by some propagation

89
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,140
delay

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,840
this is obviously base station can

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,120
estimate this propagation delay also our

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,640
sniffer can do this

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,760
so in LTE we have a special message for

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,500
this it's called timing Advance command

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,680
which will tell the user how much it's

96
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,900
delayed and how much of the advantage

97
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,299
should send the message so imagine the

98
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,599
base station sends the Uplink DCI

99
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,099
and then instead of waiting four

100
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,379
milliseconds the phone Waits four

101
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,060
milliseconds minus the value inside

102
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,819
timing Advanced command and then the

103
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,760
user users phones will will send the

104
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,500
Uplink data and to arrive to the base

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
station at the expected time

106
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,960
so how can we use these informations for

107
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
Passive localization

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,940
so obviously the first constraint is

109
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,979
very easy this timing Advance command is

110
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,600
sending the Maclay which is unencrypted

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
we can sniff it with our Uplink and

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,900
Downing sniffer just well just

113
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,360
downloading sniffer and we can infer the

114
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,060
location of the phone in this gray ring

115
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't know if you can see it well but

116
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,080
there is a gray ring with a which is

117
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,520
wide 78 meters uh this it's it's 78

118
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,780
meters wide because of the

119
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,820
discretization error of the timing

120
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,380
Advance command value

121
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,900
essentially it's not a full number it's

122
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,720
it's just some integer

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,000
second localization constraint which we

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,860
have is due to the basically propagation

125
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,740
delays so the base station sends the

126
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,680
Uplink DCI and then the phone replies

127
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,720
with the Uplink data

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,780
and because our sniffer can sniff

129
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,479
essentially both Uplink DCI and Uplink

130
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,320
data he can infer from this delay

131
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,979
um

132
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,160
an ellipsis with two focal points in the

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,199
base station and the

134
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,259
end uh sniffer the shape of the of the

135
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,259
Ellipsis is basically inferred from this

136
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,479
down this propagation delay so we can

137
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,919
show we can show it also from this

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,380
perspective so the Uplink DCI is sent by

139
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,300
the base station it arrives with some

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,419
propagation delay to the phone

141
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,979
the the sniffer actually knows exactly

142
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,360
when the Appling this area was sent

143
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,699
because he knows its location he knows

144
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,380
also the base station location therefore

145
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,820
he knows what's the propagation delay

146
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,280
between these two entities therefore it

147
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,900
knows exactly when the Uplink dcis was

148
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,479
sent phone then waits for milliseconds

149
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,300
and it replies and then it replies with

150
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,460
the Uplink data which will arrive

151
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,440
to the sniffer

152
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,020
again with some propagation delay

153
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,699
therefore the

154
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,820
the attacker is able to measure

155
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
this time between the Uplink DCI will

156
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,340
send and Uplink data was received by the

157
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,220
by the sniffer these then constrains

158
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,360
this geometry of this ellipses

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,120
so essentially we are able to to get the

160
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,199
location

161
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,300
on the intersection of this wide ring

162
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,880
and the ellipses using just one

163
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,580
using just one attacking device

164
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,440
this is because we are essentially using

165
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,479
the base station as as an attacking

166
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,639
device as well in this case obviously we

167
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
can get even better using additional

168
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
additional sniffers but this is not

169
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,300
necessarily this is not necessary

170
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,740
essentially

171
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,419
so we can we have also some distance

172
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:59,400
measurement uh demo so we have a the

173
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,620
camera base station and the sniffer

174
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,419
exactly at one location and I'm walking

175
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,139
away in this beautiful catwalk

176
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,199
and the corridor is exactly 15 meters

177
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,240
long I go there and back and you can see

178
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,940
in the graph that essentially I went

179
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,400
from 0 meters to 15 meters

180
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,860
so individual measurements are the blue

181
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,840
lines so this is for every single Uplink

182
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,160
data

183
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,919
and the orange line is a smoothie dollar

184
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
average of these

185
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,580
uh for our distance measurement

186
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,680
evaluations we used four different

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,620
phones at six different distances from

188
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,080
zero ranging from 0 to 60 meters and we

189
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,840
found out that the error was roughly uh

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
six meters or maximum six meters in

191
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,039
ninety percent of the time

192
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,380
usually it was even better obviously

193
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,180
so we showed you how we can do passive

194
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,160
localization what about stealthy

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,699
identification

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,880
so all the users in LTE protocol can

197
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,759
have two identifiers

198
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,039
one is MZ which is a persistent

199
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,479
identifier

200
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,220
which is hard coded inside the SIM card

201
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,560
and it's never sent in plain text or

202
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,180
well it sent only the very first time

203
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,240
the the user connects to the network

204
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,099
otherwise

205
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,259
the phone always uses TMZ which is a

206
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,539
temporary identifier which is assigned

207
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,180
by the network and it changes regularly

208
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,860
and it is sent at every single

209
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,960
connection attempt so as I said at the

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
beginning we need for tracking we need

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,300
both vocalization and uh the identity

212
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,399
obviously we can use teamz for the

213
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,740
identification however when the teams it

214
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,779
would change we wouldn't be able to

215
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,179
match these two teams is together that

216
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,520
it's one person therefore we need to

217
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,979
somehow find a way how to get the MZ out

218
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,480
of them

219
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,420
uh how we can get MZ out of the phone

220
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,580
so this was usually done using a MZ

221
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,920
catchers based on the fake base stations

222
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,980
however we have a new type of attacking

223
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,440
method called overshadowing where we

224
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,140
don't send something at this all the

225
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,540
time like fake base station what we only

226
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,459
overshadow one single message in the

227
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,560
protocol

228
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,440
this is way better than fake base

229
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
station not only because we send very

230
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,480
limited in very limited time but also we

231
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
need only 1.8 DB more power than an

232
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,399
original signal whereas for fake base

233
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,100
station base stations it's roughly

234
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,040
around 30 DB so our overshadowing is

235
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,200
basically very stealthy is not

236
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,120
detectable at all and normal detection

237
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,980
methods for fake base Stations don't

238
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,940
work

239
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,220
so we are basically overshadowing the

240
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,920
signal so we we call our system adapt

241
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,240
over

242
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,980
and what happens in the resource given

243
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,620
downlink we overshadow the DCI with our

244
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,800
malicious DCI which then points to

245
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,560
malicious user data in the protocol

246
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,519
level

247
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,500
usually during normal connection setup

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,600
we first the phones and some connection

249
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,540
information with the TMZ then it sends

250
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,920
service requests

251
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,779
and the base station replies with the

252
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,300
security mode command we overshadowed

253
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,920
this message with the identity request

254
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,740
which asks the phone for its MZ

255
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,080
the phone then will be happy to answer

256
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,600
us with its Embassy number sending plain

257
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,880
text which we can sniff using our

258
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
sniffer

259
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,399
so next picture just shows how our setup

260
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,839
looks like on the left hand side you

261
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,339
have the overshadowing setup called

262
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,440
adapt over on the right hand side is our

263
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,899
sniffer both Uplink and downlink sniffer

264
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,540
at the bottom you can see a picture from

265
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,640
Bioshock with the MZ number here

266
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,800
essentially

267
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,560
uh showing how we did the attack in the

268
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,740
real in real world network of a Swiss

269
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,899
operator

270
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,519
to summarize

271
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,980
l-track does stealthy tracking using

272
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,779
passive localization

273
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,700
based on timing Advanced command and

274
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,620
propagation delay estimation

275
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,600
and stealthy identification based on

276
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,360
overshadowing and Uplink sniffing

277
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,220
so thank you very much

278
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,300
do you have any questions
