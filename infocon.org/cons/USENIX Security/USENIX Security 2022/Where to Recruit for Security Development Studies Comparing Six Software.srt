00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,160
hello everyone my name is Arjun God and

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,019
today I'll be presenting our work on

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,160
where to recruit for security

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,960
development studies comparing six

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,180
software developer samples

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,039
developers have received increased

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,320
research attention in recent years with

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,660
varying levels of experience skills and

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,460
knowledge and well-paid jobs with heavy

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,680
workloads offering motivating incentives

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,080
for their participation can be hard

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,120
imagine a research group planning to do

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,160
a security study with developers first

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,320
question well from where do you recruit

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,960
participants possible solutions look at

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,520
previous security studies for different

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,140
recruitment options

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,420
alas the list of options is quite long

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,000
since there are so many options by using

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,620
them for the pros and cons would be

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
valuable for the research community

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,059
therefore in this work we study the

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,559
merits and demerits of different

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,180
recruitment options to recruit

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,800
participants with software development

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,539
experience for security development

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,899
studies to do so we first analyzed 59

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,880
papers to identify recruitment options

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,040
we then conducted a comparative online

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,680
study with 706 developers across six

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,939
samples

32
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,100
with a competitive online study we

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,659
wanted to investigate participants

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,100
General software development and

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,380
security development experiences skills

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,180
and knowledge how well do samples

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,159
compare and things researchers should

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,780
consider when sampling for security

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,580
development studies

40
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,040
for the literature analysis we selected

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,600
Publications in the field of usable

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,880
security and privacy that conducted user

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,159
studies we focused on Works published

44
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,820
between 2016 and 2020 at the top usable

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,799
security and privacy as well as human

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,619
computer interaction venues

47
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,659
two authors independently reviewed the

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,520
proceedings published between January

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,780
2016 and September 2020. additionally we

50
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,520
compared our set of papers with the

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,380
developer papers listed into other

52
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,380
related Publications from the remaining

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,840
set of papers we extracted the type and

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
number of participants recruitment

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,740
options compensation details and the

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,439
survey questions we had 59 papers in a

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
final set after resolving disagreements

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,120
overall we sorted the recruitment

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Alternatives we found into six

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,440
categories however for our study we did

61
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,239
not recruit participants from all of

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,060
them for example we excluded recruitment

63
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,860
options that vary significantly between

64
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,020
research teams due to the location or

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
personal Network making them unlikely to

66
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,819
produce generalizable results

67
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,160
for our study we recruited from mtech

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,780
and prolific which are crowdsourcing

69
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,520
platforms where people could Outsource

70
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,560
their jobs for example surveys to a

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,780
distributed Workforce from upwork and

72
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,640
freelancer.com which are freelancing

73
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
platforms where one can post jobs and

74
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,080
wait for skilled Freelancers to apply or

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,300
Target them based on their skills and

76
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,860
Google pay and computer science students

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,140
which required cold emailing despite

78
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,700
being unaware of any relevant previous

79
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,620
work recruiting participants with

80
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,180
software development experience from

81
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,940
Amazon mtuk we chose it because of its

82
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,560
General popularity within the usable

83
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,300
security and privacy research community

84
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,760
and to probe its viability for future

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
security developer studies

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,140
based on the literature analysis results

87
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,019
we designed pre-tested and conducted a

88
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,580
competitive online study with six

89
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,440
samples of Developers

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,659
our survey consisted of five sections

91
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,459
starting from introduction to questions

92
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,080
about software development background

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,819
questions addressing participants

94
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,620
workplace programming experience

95
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,599
including experience with security and

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,099
general demographics

97
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,260
We performed two rounds of pilot studies

98
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,879
on prolific

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,220
as mentioned previously we recruited

100
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,099
participants from mtech prolific upwork

101
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,440
freelancer Google Play and CA student

102
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,700
samples

103
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,620
as we were unable to confirm the

104
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,360
self-reported programming knowledge of

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,640
prolific and mtech participants We

106
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,560
additionally added two programming skill

107
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,780
screening questions validated previously

108
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,640
by danilovietel and read it both

109
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,099
platforms we observed that this led to a

110
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,739
higher data quality on mtech now we

111
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,540
present the results from our data

112
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,739
analysis

113
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,920
overall we had 706 valid responses

114
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,959
sample wise breakdown can be seen on the

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,540
screen we found a high gender cap across

116
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,860
all samples with participants

117
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,200
predominantly identifying themselves as

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,480
male with respect to Ace the youngest

119
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,339
group for CA students followed by upwork

120
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,959
and prollyville while Google Play

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,899
participants were the oldest majority on

122
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,940
all samples study computer science with

123
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,680
very less participants having a security

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,440
focus with the exception of M Turk by

125
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,020
21.8 percentage self-reported a computer

126
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,780
security focus in their studies software

127
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,580
development experience was by far most

128
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,220
common in all of our samples

129
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,419
participants were also less experienced

130
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,520
with security level areas such as

131
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
reverse engineering or vulnerability

132
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,000
research

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,699
regarding ethnicity we find that most

134
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,280
participants on prolific Google Play M

135
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,259
Turk and in the student sample reported

136
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,540
to be white or european

137
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,460
with respect to programming and security

138
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,800
experience Google Play participants

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
reported the highest overall development

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,820
highest professional development as well

141
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,280
as higher security experience in

142
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,380
contrast students were least experienced

143
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,300
regarding both overall and professional

144
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,460
development while qualific participants

145
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,639
reported the lowest security experience

146
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,600
Additionally the majority of

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,639
participants on freelancer Google Play

148
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,919
and upwork reported working on software

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,960
development tasks more than 20 hours per

150
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,000
week which fits to the findings of the

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,460
commonly reported full-time status

152
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,860
next we asked our participants to rate

153
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,240
their proficiencies in different

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,919
development areas and programming

155
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,020
scripting and markup languages since

156
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,759
these are an essential criteria for

157
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,620
developer studies with practical tasks

158
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,500
overall mtech participants report higher

159
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,539
rating for most development areas and

160
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,639
some languages although we find no

161
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,800
single language standing out

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,380
for development areas we see that

163
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,300
front-end and full stack development had

164
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,060
high overall ratings likely due to them

165
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,039
being widespread areas which is also

166
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,840
backed up by stack Overflow developer

167
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
survey in which they were among the

168
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,800
three most commonly stated roles Google

169
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,479
Play participants had the highest

170
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,860
average self ratings for mobile

171
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,660
development

172
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,539
for programming languages we found SQL

173
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,000
highly rated on freelancer and HTML CSS

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,639
very highly rated on upwork in contrast

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,160
Java was highly rated by CA students and

176
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,139
Google Play developers likely due to

177
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,000
Java's classroom popularity and the

178
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,979
basis for Android development

179
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,020
proficiencies in languages like rust

180
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,000
followed by Co and Ruby vibrated the

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,639
lowest in almost all samples

182
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,919
next we inquire participants about the

183
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
security trainings and their experience

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,220
with implementing specific security

185
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,600
features

186
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,580
more than one-third of the participants

187
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,800
received a security related training at

188
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
work in almost all samples except for

189
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,680
prolific

190
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
receiving a security related training at

191
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,120
educational institutions was highest for

192
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,139
students

193
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,060
majority of Google Play participants

194
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,340
reported that they were self-taught with

195
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,020
similar High numbers on upwork and

196
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,520
freelancer

197
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,440
on the other hand our participants

198
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,819
reported most experience with

199
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,259
implementing input validation

200
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,479
authorization and authentication using

201
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,000
API Keys using encryption decryption and

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,280
storing user credentials participants

203
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,020
from upwork freelancer and Google Play

204
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,759
reported the most experience with

205
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,400
implementing specific security features

206
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,139
with respect to security related

207
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,060
activities and events we found that

208
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,919
participants more commonly attended

209
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,900
security related events or had

210
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,360
previously disclosed vulnerabilities

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,280
here mdep participants report High

212
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,080
numbers in comparison to other samples

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,680
except for disclosing vulnerabilities

214
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,440
Now we move on to our recommendations

215
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
researchers need to consider the target

216
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,740
population when deciding for or against

217
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,080
recruitment options so based on our

218
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,699
results we discuss and provide

219
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,860
recommendations for recruitment based on

220
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,780
participant characteristics and specific

221
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,880
recruitment strategies

222
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,919
development experience skills and

223
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,780
knowledge are commonly used recruitment

224
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,819
criteria for secure development studies

225
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,160
Google Play developers have the highest

226
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,440
development experience but they are

227
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,300
focused on Java they also have high

228
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,759
ratings for kotlin among others CS

229
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,139
students are less experienced as

230
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,759
compared to other samples but are

231
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,740
proficient in languages like Java and

232
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
python in comparison MTA can freelance

233
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,060
the participants report the second

234
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,560
highest overall and professional

235
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,840
development experience respectively

236
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,819
so they can be considered reasonable

237
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,860
developer recruitment alternative to

238
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,080
Google play with the benefit of offering

239
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,879
faster recruitment as compared to Google

241
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,300
for security experience skills and

knowledge freelancer and upwork

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
participants often reported High values

244
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,059
more than mtech at some instances on

245
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,520
security related questions while limited

246
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,380
participants reported High values on

247
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,539
some security related questions we found

248
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,458
a high number of invalid and similar

249
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,380
answers likely due to multi-accounting

250
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,480
in our initial run and we rated the

251
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,580
sample with an adjusted screening that

252
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,959
included programming skill questions

253
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
from Danny lovite l

254
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,279
the usage of some specific security

255
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,500
features for example input validation

256
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,260
was most common on upwork freelancer and

257
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,300
Google Play which shows that they have a

258
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,920
broad range of experience with secure

259
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,260
development as compared to other samples

260
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,060
students as well as prolific

261
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,040
participants were less experienced with

262
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,540
security

263
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,880
sample diversity is also an important

264
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,560
parameter in addition to experience

265
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,540
skills and knowledge majority of

266
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,100
participants were male across all

267
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,440
samples which is sadly usual in security

268
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,899
research with respect to ethnicity

269
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,820
participants were of fight or of

270
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,560
European descent across most samples

271
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,660
ethnic diversity was better on

272
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,640
freelancer and upwork

273
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,160
the crowdsourcing platforms mtech and

274
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,200
prolific have straightforward and fast

275
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,899
recruitment process we recommend mtech

276
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,640
along with a pre-screening survey for

277
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,680
improved data quality for larger studies

278
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,600
with more participants where some noise

279
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,060
in the data could be acceptable

280
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,339
for the freelancing platforms upwork and

281
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,140
freelancer data is less likely to be

282
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,360
noisy and can be used by studies with a

283
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,940
smaller number of required participants

284
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,200
recruitment is also more intuitive on

285
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,940
upwork and we recommend it to recruit

286
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,220
Developers for practical coding tasks or

287
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,260
similarly larger tasks

288
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,600
Distributing a survey via email is the

289
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,940
fastest and cheapest but it has worst

290
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,500
response rates and offering

291
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,920
compensations is also more complex

292
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,800
sending unsolicited email invites is

293
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,440
increasingly perceived as spam

294
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,260
additionally certain privacy laws such

295
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,080
as gdpr in the EU prohibit collecting

296
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,500
and using non-public contact information

297
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,200
so here is a quick recap our methodology

298
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,420
consisted of literature analysis which

299
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,339
informed and motivated our competitive

300
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,740
online study with six developer samples

301
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,019
we then provide recommendations for

302
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,000
recruitment platforms to be used in

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,100
certain security study types

304
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,600
thank you very much for your attention

305
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,459
and a big thanks to all the co-authors

306
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,719
for the hard work and support
