1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,760
all right thanks franzi and a huge thank

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,620
you to the conference for the best paper

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,940
award I'm Alex Alderman and uh incidents

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,920
involving election technology and

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,160
processes occur during practically every

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,980
election cycle voters see headlines like

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,920
these reporting technical glitches as

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,260
officials scrambled to reassure the

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,098
public

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,680
but such incidents are rarely formally

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,860
investigated this is a lost opportunity

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,980
to improve election accuracy and uphold

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,960
public Trust

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
other fields that prioritize safety and

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,460
reliability like Transportation

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,020
structural engineering and increasingly

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,160
computer security routinely conduct

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,379
post-incident investigations these seek

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,180
to determine and correct underlying

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,239
causes to uncover related issues

21
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,220
disseminate lessons and prevent

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,420
recurrence

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,000
crucially they are typically not about

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
establishing blame

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,799
my goal in this work is to establish a

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,760
model for such rigorous independent and

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,479
non-partisan post-incident

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,939
investigations within the election space

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,680
perhaps the most consequential election

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
technology incident in recent years

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
occurred in Antrim County Michigan

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,180
during the 2020 presidential election

33
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,100
the County's election Night results were

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,920
badly and obviously wrong they showed

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
Joe Biden and other Democrats winning

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
this solidly Republican County by a

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,799
landslide

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,140
officials quickly issued a correction

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,240
assuring the public that the problems

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,220
were the result of a quote software

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,500
update that mistakenly hadn't been

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,460
applied to the Dominion voting machines

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,140
but the damage had been done the

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,180
incident spawned conspiracy theories

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,579
that were seized on by President Trump

46
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,920
and have undermined confidence in

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,500
elections to this day

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,380
in the immediate aftermath a legal team

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,900
linked to the Trump campaign sued in

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,060
state court and was granted access to

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,099
perform a forensic investigation of

52
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,840
antrim's voting system

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,560
within only a week a group called Allied

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,959
security operations group had produced a

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,940
report claiming to have discovered

56
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,340
evidence that the Dominion machines were

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,260
quote intentionally and purposefully

58
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,680
designed to facilitate fraud

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,200
the attorney behind that lawsuit Matthew

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,660
deperno is now the presumptive

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,940
Republican nominee for Michigan attorney

62
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,819
general and as of this week he is

63
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,160
reportedly under investigation himself

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,379
for breaching the security of boating

65
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,239
equipment

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,580
um but when asog's forensic report first

67
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,560
became public deferno called on

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,900
President Trump to

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,599
um act and it was unclear at the time

70
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,180
what that meant but the Congressional

71
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,099
committee investigating the events of

72
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,040
January 6th obtained a draft executive

73
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,379
order never issued by President Trump

74
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,319
that cites aesag's bindings in Antrim as

75
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,900
a basis to authorize the military to

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,980
seize voting machines

77
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,580
in response to the asag report

78
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,540
Michigan's Secretary of State and

79
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,819
attorney general asked me to perform an

80
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,800
independent forensic investigation of

81
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,420
the Antrim incident

82
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,300
I sought to determine what caused the

83
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,280
errors whether they were evidence of an

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,560
attack or Foul Play if they had been

85
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,239
fully corrected and whether they were

86
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,700
likely to affect other localities and

87
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,860
also what should be done to prevent such

88
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,360
issues in the future

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
the state published my complete findings

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,519
in March 2021.

91
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,140
before we get into what caused the

92
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,239
incident let me explain how antrim's

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,940
election system works the county uses an

94
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,920
election management system that consists

95
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,560
of a Windows 10 PC running Dominion

96
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,980
democracy Suite software this EMS is

97
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,900
used before each election to prepare

98
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,360
election definitions which are data

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,099
files that describe what's on the ballot

100
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,439
and afterwards to combine the results

101
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,380
from 18 ballot scanners at local

102
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,720
precincts across the county

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,060
there's no network connectivity but

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,040
instead files are distributed and

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
returned using compact flash cards each

106
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,220
scanner outputs both electronic records

107
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,979
of every ballot and also a paper pull

108
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,259
tape summarizing the number of votes for

109
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,080
each candidate for my investigation I

110
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,060
was provided copies of the EMS hard

111
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,919
drive the scanner memory cards and the

112
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,440
poll tapes I also reverse engineered the

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,660
undocumented Dominion file formats and

114
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,180
software and built new tools to analyze

115
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,160
them

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,440
all right so what did we find

117
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,080
I used logs from the scanners in EMS

118
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,180
first to reconstruct events before the

119
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,080
election

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,780
in September County staff had approved

121
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,880
the ballot designs for printing and they

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,860
loaded the election definitions onto the

123
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,440
EMS and the scanners as usual

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,740
however in early October errors were

125
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,120
discovered in three of the ballot

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,520
designs for instance in one Precinct the

127
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,500
ballot showed a school board contest for

128
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,180
the wrong District

129
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,639
workers revised the election definitions

130
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,680
and ordered nude ballots printed and

131
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,880
they loaded the revised election

132
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,000
definitions into the EMS but only

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,600
updated two of the 18 scanners this

134
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,100
would prove to be a consequential

135
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,600
mistake

136
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,060
the first sign of trouble though didn't

137
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,919
happen until election night when workers

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,539
loaded the results from the scanner

139
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,699
memory cards into the EMS

140
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,860
three cards failed to load despite

141
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,900
multiple attempts rather than

142
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,940
investigating election staff manually

143
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,620
entered these results from the poll

144
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,259
tapes and this process took until four

145
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,120
o'clock in the morning

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,340
working so late at night the staffers

147
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,800
kind of understandably neglected to

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,660
closely review the county-wide results

149
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,820
before publishing them

150
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,039
later that morning however the county

151
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,500
was told by Outsiders that the results

152
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,020
were obviously wrong staff took them

153
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,120
down and manually entered the remaining

154
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,039
results from the poll tapes to correct

155
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,219
them

156
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,620
so what caused the major errors I was

157
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,139
able to determine the cause by reviewing

158
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,819
the election definitions and the result

159
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,759
files what happened is that internally

160
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,919
the Dominion system represents each

161
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,259
possible Choice across every ballot

162
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,139
Style with a sequential ID number the

163
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,520
correction to the School Board Race

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,620
necessitated inserting an additional

165
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,020
Choice which caused the idea of every

166
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,000
subsequent candidate throughout the

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,220
county to increase by one

168
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,919
scanners that weren't updated use the

169
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,860
old IDs when the EMS interpreted their

170
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,380
results using the new IDs it assigned

171
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,960
the votes to the wrong candidates as you

172
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,759
can see here on the right in the

173
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,560
presidential race the effect was

174
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
essentially that for affected precincts

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,419
Biden received the votes cast for Trump

176
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,520
and Trump received the votes cast for

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
the libertarian candidate and so on down

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,139
the ballot

179
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,720
so I confirmed that the major errors had

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
been corrected uh using several

181
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,680
different tests Each of which produced

182
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,479
the expected results

183
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,120
first I loaded each card into the EMS

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
using the matching election definition I

185
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,919
also counted the votes from the memory

186
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,620
cards directly myself using software I

187
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,039
wrote without Reliance on the EMS

188
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,740
finally I personally and by hand added

189
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,080
up the individual results from the

190
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,599
scanner pull types across the county and

191
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,160
got exactly the same as the final

192
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,419
results

193
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,520
in addition the state Bureau of

194
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,160
Elections manually recounted all of the

195
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,139
votes from the presidential race using

196
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,360
the original paper ballots

197
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,880
based on these different tests we can be

198
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,800
very sure that the mismatched election

199
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,360
definitions caused the large

200
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,580
discrepancies and that Donald Trump won

201
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,479
Antrim County by nearly 4 000 votes

202
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,000
unfortunately the mismatched election

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,280
definition was not the only problem with

204
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,560
antrim's results the county ultimately

205
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,199
reported results five times sometimes

206
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,300
changing candidates totals by thousands

207
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,740
of votes

208
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,620
after the initial erroneous results the

209
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,360
county manually entered totals from the

210
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,759
poll tapes but staff failed to remove

211
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,699
all of the old data the officially

212
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,039
certified results corrected this but the

213
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,740
manual data entry still contained typos

214
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,440
that affected nearly 2.6 percent of

215
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,020
votes Statewide and this is despite the

216
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,179
fact that Michigan law requires County

217
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,099
canvassers to compare the official

218
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,719
results to the poll types before

219
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,580
certifying them

220
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,860
some of the typos were corrected in a

221
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,300
fourth set of results but others

222
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,640
remained and were only corrected in the

223
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,320
final set of results published on

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,160
November 21st

225
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,720
despite the unusual attention that

226
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,839
Antrim received I've found that even the

227
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,820
final certified results still contain

228
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,980
errors that affect certain down ballot

229
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,740
races one problem was simply that many

230
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,660
mail-in voters first received the

231
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,459
misprinted ballots and were only later

232
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,399
sent corrected ones some returned each

233
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,680
version but there was no process to

234
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,480
separate them and the scanners were not

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,000
programmed to be able to tell them apart

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,279
targets for certain contests moved

237
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,500
between the designs so the scanners

238
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,420
miscounted these votes on either the

239
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,339
initial or the revised ballots depending

240
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,860
on which election definition was in use

241
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,019
fortunately I was able to bound the

242
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,820
number of votes that were affected and

243
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,100
no outcome was changed

244
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,920
however I also uncovered a different

245
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,680
error that quite possibly did change the

246
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
outcome of one local contest in the

247
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,399
final results

248
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,380
Central Lake Township scanned its

249
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,300
ballots twice because the scanner was

250
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,680
initially programmed with the wrong

251
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,740
School Board race in the first scan a

252
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,440
local marijuana initiative failed in a

253
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,200
tie but in the second scan it passed by

254
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,399
one vote

255
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,620
why the difference well I recovered

256
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,200
partial records that suggest that that

257
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,019
during the second scan whether correctly

258
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,360
or due to human error one particular

259
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,220
ballot was omitted that would have

260
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,899
changed the results

261
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,240
despite the narrow margin nobody

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,100
challenged the outcome within the

263
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,200
statutory time frame so the final

264
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,700
results will stand forever

265
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,560
while my analysis was not a Security

266
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,740
review I did note or confirm several

267
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,019
security problems with the EMS along the

268
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:34,800
way

269
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
all users shared a single Windows login

270
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,660
with administrator privileges allowing

271
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,700
them to alter logs or bypass access

272
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,040
controls

273
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,019
SQL management Studio was installed

274
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,000
allowing users to directly alter the

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,579
election databases the Windows security

276
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,560
updates were more than two years out of

277
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,540
date and the security log from the

278
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,180
election day had been discarded because

279
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,480
the log had reached a fixed maximum size

280
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,640
the MS also did not use full disk

281
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,720
encryption

282
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,640
these issues are all real security

283
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,440
problems and should be mitigated

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,779
promptly but it's important to note that

285
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,459
there is no evidence that they were ever

286
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,680
exploited in antrum

287
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,440
so ultimately my investigation was able

288
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,660
to account for all known anomalies in

289
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,519
antrim's results including several that

290
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,140
I discovered myself

291
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,180
all arose from human error during

292
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,820
unusual circumstances involving ballot

293
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,740
design changes at the last minute which

294
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,480
are unlikely to have occurred widely

295
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,500
elsewhere

296
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,180
although the major errors have been

297
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,920
fully corrected I determined that

298
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,200
certain down ballot contests still

299
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,779
contain smaller errors

300
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,079
several opportunities to discover the

301
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,600
problems were missed due to further

302
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,360
human errors including ones in processes

303
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,339
that are important safeguards for

304
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,500
security and accuracy such as logic and

305
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,360
accuracy testing and pre-certification

306
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,480
canvassing the election software also

307
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,339
certainly could have done more to

308
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,019
prevent the human errors from affecting

309
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,480
results but there's no basis to conclude

310
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,279
it was deliberately designed to

311
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,500
facilitate fraud

312
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,420
based on this understanding of the

313
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,920
events in Antrim County I make a number

314
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,640
of recommendations the common theme is

315
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,980
to bring a more scientific mindset to

316
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,380
election Administration such as by

317
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,600
reviewing and strengthening procedural

318
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,820
fail-safes and improving usability for

319
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,980
poll workers both of which are problems

320
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,140
that badly need more attention from our

321
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,760
research community

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,279
I also suggest steps to facilitate

323
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,860
post-election forensics by creating and

324
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,380
better preserving digital records

325
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,200
finally I recommend that future election

326
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,360
incidents when they occur as they

327
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,680
inevitably will should be followed by

328
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,880
officials conducting rigorous

329
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,160
post-election investigations to ensure

330
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,500
the problems are understood and that

331
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,540
lessons are shared to prevent recurrence

332
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,180
I hope this work can serve as a model

333
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,040
for such efforts thank you
