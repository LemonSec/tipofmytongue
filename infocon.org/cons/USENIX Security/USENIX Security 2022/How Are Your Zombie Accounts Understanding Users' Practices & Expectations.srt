1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,460
hello everyone my name is Eden Mill I'm

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,620
going to presenting the work I did with

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,139
my colleagues on users practice and

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,359
expectation on mobile app account

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,800
deletion

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,080
the right to have personal data deleted

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,539
is one of the important rights for

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,300
privacy protection and has been clearly

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,840
stipulated in words account deletion is

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,640
the important machine designed by

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,460
lenders for exercising the red to delete

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,180
when users stop using apps users

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,899
register account in order to use the app

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,480
accordingly app lenders collect users

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,360
information in store it for the apps

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,239
that users do not use anymore if they

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,000
forget to delete the account users

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,980
online records and personal information

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,280
will be preserved for a long time

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,260
increasing the risk of the disclosure of

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,199
personal information and accounts in

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,979
that case is called Zombie accounts

23
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,020
nowadays accounts deletion process is

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,659
designed differently in the absence of

25
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,840
standard practice some apps allow users

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,479
to delete the account within app like

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
shown in the picture however some apps

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,880
require users to delete from a browser

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,259
or by email

30
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,259
of your prayer work discussed the design

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,320
and users perspective of data deletion

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,500
on the web however the user interface in

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,560
needing operations in mobile apps had

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,380
key difference from the web so we take a

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,720
first step towards a constellation in

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,220
mobile contact

37
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,619
actually we want to investigate users

38
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,780
awareness of protective data through

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,079
account division exactly about user's

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,600
Mobile account deletion experience in

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,360
their understanding last we want to know

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
better account deletion design in modern

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,840
mobile apps meet users expectations

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
in order to answer the both research

45
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,639
questions we have carried out the

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,280
investigations through three parts

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,140
including an empirical management of

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,620
apps a online service and an additional

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,140
offline interview these three are

50
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,720
interrelated the results of the

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,540
empirical studies served as a free study

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,140
to get the design and implementation of

53
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,720
the following service and interview

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,319
in a free study we first picked 60 apps

55
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,260
in China and the US in the manually

56
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,980
explored and recorded the whole deleting

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,860
process of those apps finally we

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,500
summarized a general account deletion

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,099
process model based on our observations

60
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,800
in general the mobile app account

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
deletion consists of four components

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,940
operation condition effect and time

63
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,060
frame the participant for online servers

64
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,120
were resecute from prolific and vacation

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,379
respectively and we finally got

66
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,140
647 response from China in the US we

67
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,659
didn't conduct an offline interview with

68
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,420
another 20 participants they were asked

69
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,000
to delete account of three apps and then

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,540
we obtained their realistic feelings and

71
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,220
expectations based on the fresh

72
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,659
experience

73
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,720
for research question 1 we investigated

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,959
the necessity of account deletion in the

75
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,980
user's awareness we found that 89 of our

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,900
participants were concerned about their

77
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,700
personal information and most

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,159
participants were aware of the Reds to

79
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,220
delete they got that 75 of the

80
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,920
participants may help zombie account in

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,200
their daily practice as they just in

82
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,659
installed apps would do nothing when

83
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,640
they stopped using the app any longer

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,280
and this means the awareness of a

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,459
continuation needs to be improved

86
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,459
next we found most participants were

87
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,799
strongly desired to delete personal data

88
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,560
in this study account and more than half

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,659
participants expressed

90
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,840
their concern and experience present

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,139
promotional pushes information

92
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,940
disclosing and the financial loss such

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,860
as charging for subscription

94
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,380
automatically are the top three troubles

95
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,300
meant by participants caused by not

96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,880
still working on constantly surprisedly

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,000
22 of participants had the experience

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
that although it was the first time to

99
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,560
use an app that accidentally used

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,259
another person's account this real

101
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,540
situation is hard to be noticed by

102
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,820
zombie account owner but put the owner's

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
information at Great risk in conclusion

104
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,520
zombie accounts have no negligible

105
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,620
impacts on users and the content

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,960
deletion is necessary desired by most

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,800
people

108
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,620
the research question 2 the practice of

109
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,040
account deletion 55 of the participants

110
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,380
expressed that state has successfully

111
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,020
delete an account before it seems that

112
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,940
users in the U.S could have better

113
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,400
account deletion habits as more American

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,100
participants claimed a constitution

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,520
experience that construct 30 percent of

116
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,740
the participants inflict they never

117
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,560
tried to delete an account most of them

118
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
have never considered deleting the

119
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,240
account because of the lack of awareness

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,060
fifty percent of participants cleaned

121
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,820
they tried to delete accounts but failed

122
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,639
for some reasons they said that they

123
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,979
could not find the entry and too many

124
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,440
steps provided them from successfully

125
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,039
completing the account deletion process

126
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,039
the result user's understanding firstly

127
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,380
we pointed out that the large quantity

128
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,020
of participants never read or only took

129
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,720
a clear as the policy which contains

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,180
some instructions about a constellation

131
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,699
we thought the combination of most

132
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,440
participants were scrapped different

133
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,039
from the claim of app vendors some basic

134
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,740
common effects of accounts division were

135
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,560
not understood when trusted by users for

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
example more than half of the

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,220
participants thought that their personal

138
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,039
data would not be deleted after accounts

139
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,139
deletion and they thought the deletion

140
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,139
is reversible this means users will not

141
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,360
correctly work completely understand

142
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,520
account deletion

143
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,639
so our answer for research question two

144
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,560
is that more than half of the

145
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,900
participants had successfully account

146
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,020
deletion experience and frankly design

147
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,780
after a constellation blocks a number of

148
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,780
users most people in general do not

149
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,180
understand the real effect of account

150
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,280
deletion

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,220
research question 3 was addressed by

152
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,380
both the online service and in-person

153
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,080
interviews the questions are structured

154
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,360
with the account deletion model they

155
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,539
proposed including operation condition

156
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,780
effect and time frame

157
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,360
first the operation of account deletion

158
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,060
finding the account's deletion entry is

159
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,240
the most frequently reported issue

160
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,800
participants needed to collect certain

161
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,500
types to find the entry for apps on

162
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,080
average that is absurd as many

163
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,720
colleagues as the average class method

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,720
in the presiding participants believed

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,819
that entry should be located more

166
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,479
apparently and easier for them to fight

167
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,360
the complicated account deletion process

168
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,819
was chosen as the second inconvenient

169
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,280
Factor steps of accounts deletion

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,919
generally include notification written

171
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,740
Gathering and authentication some

172
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,720
participants thoughts that those steps

173
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,199
are unnecessary the set chosen reason is

174
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,660
a meaningful and complaining about the

175
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,120
need to confirm the anxiety again when

176
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,580
deleting the account however in general

177
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,160
the result shows the account deletion

178
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,220
status can be accepted by most people a

179
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,780
few participants in the online

180
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,000
questionnaire are choose the deletion

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,940
three conditions are too strict for the

182
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,400
condition requiring users operation some

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,740
partitions suggested that apps could

184
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,740
provide a button directly linked to the

185
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,020
pre-process page for users to operate

186
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,479
for the conditions such as no account

187
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,660
changing within 30 days and no other in

188
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,879
process within 30 days participants

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,580
generally indicted that the shorter time

190
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,520
limit is bad better after 30 days I

191
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,679
would forgot that there is an account

192
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,958
waiting to be deleted in the online

193
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,659
surveys 42 percent of the participants

194
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,559
complained the data deletion cannot be

195
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,260
completed immediately almost all

196
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,180
participants reaches the data to be

197
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,399
deleted within seven days however

198
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,019
according to our environment in

199
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,839
pre-study the average deletion period of

200
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,920
current apps is 14 days meanwhile most

201
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,680
people expected to be notified when

202
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,720
their account deletion request was

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,700
finished and the nearly half of the

204
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,279
participants wanted to keep the right to

205
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,440
withdrawal delusion

206
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,200
finally we asked what data would like to

207
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,899
be deleted after account deletion in the

208
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,940
in-person interviews identity

209
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,580
information like phone number ID number

210
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,339
is the one most participants expect to

211
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,860
be deleted followed by the account

212
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,839
information including nickname

213
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,180
personality settings also some

214
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,920
participants thought that once the

215
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
deletion is requested all information

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,360
connected to that account should be

217
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,820
implementally deleted as well however

218
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,680
only 32 percent of the test apps clearly

219
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,140
claimed to delete all users personal

220
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,899
information which doesn't match users

221
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,459
expectation

222
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,980
it can be informed that the accounts

223
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,920
deletion in politications of the apps

224
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,100
today do not meet users exportation and

225
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,320
may even block users from exercising

226
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,300
direct to delete

227
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,180
our finding indiced that the right to

228
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,700
delete and accounts deletion are highly

229
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,820
demanded by users but most users likely

230
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,800
forgot to deal with their zombie

231
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,959
accounts and it could bring the

232
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,660
realistic privacy and the security risk

233
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,600
of wisely vendors have motivation to

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
keep users which probably leads to a

235
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,300
design of complex operations strict

236
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,180
conditions and long time frames the key

237
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,519
point is to improve the usability and

238
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,800
the Privacy benefits of a mobile app

239
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,380
account deletion we try to marrow

240
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,660
current apps practice and provide

241
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,540
several recommendations of wisely using

242
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,940
users continues in simplifying the

243
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,399
Mobile account deletion operation are

244
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,500
the most directed ways to reduce the

245
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,300
qualification of zombie accounts

246
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,300
moreover improving the transparency and

247
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,600
providing comprehensive and user

248
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,720
definable setting will help narrow the

249
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
gap between users and apps vendors

250
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,260
in conclusion our work released a new

251
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,260
issue about Mobile account deletion our

252
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,839
new findings in understanding will lead

253
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,660
to better design of today's mobile app

254
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,880
account deletion and contribute to

255
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,399
better protection on customers personal

256
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,220
data that's all thanks for listening
