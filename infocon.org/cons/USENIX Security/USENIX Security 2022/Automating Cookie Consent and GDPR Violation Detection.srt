1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,900
all right so uh yeah Welcome to our talk

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,420
about automating cookie content and gdpr

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,000
violation detection this was joint work

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,640
with Carl kubichek Carlos caprini and

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,220
David Basin from eth Zurich

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,939
and so to begin well it is I am sure it

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,800
is widely known and confirmed by past

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,320
research that cookies are used to track

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,440
users online and well this commonly

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,600
happens without the user even being

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,360
aware of it so to get the situation

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,059
under control the European Union has

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,340
passed laws that require websites to

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,040
notify users and request consent before

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,280
data can be processed and because of

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,860
this many websites today now display

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,199
these kinds of consent notices like you

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,600
can see here which come in various forms

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,780
like banners pop-ups and they can range

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,940
from simple notifications to very

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,240
complex menus which are very confusing

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,960
are also often for the user and there

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,240
the user can consent to various

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,979
different third parties

25
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,939
now what uh what like what the EU law

26
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,880
actually requires is that so there are

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
two main laws which are the e-privacy

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,600
directive and the general data

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,180
protection regulation or gdpr

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,479
and to eat privacy directive states that

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,140
all data collection requires consent

32
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,759
except that which is strictly necessary

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
such as for example authentication

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,740
cookies which are of course necessary to

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,020
make the website work

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,600
and moreover the gdpr defines the

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,700
conditions that are needed for valid

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,320
consent

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,899
so consent needs to be freely given and

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,420
unambiguous which means that users

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,540
cannot should not be forced to to give

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,000
consent and moreover our website cannot

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
impress implicitly assume that when a

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,579
visitor browses a website that they uh

45
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,619
that they have also automatically

46
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,139
consented to data collection

47
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,140
moreover consent needs to be specific

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,860
and informed consent notices must State

49
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,620
the reasons for data collection and they

50
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,540
must separate the data collection into

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,300
clearly defined purposes like it is done

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,060
on this example they are yeah separated

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,400
into different categories

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,379
now if these regulations are not

55
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,680
followed of course websites May face

56
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,620
large fines from authorities but past

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,540
research has actually shown that this

58
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,599
does not that non-compliance is still

59
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,080
widespread despite this a significant

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,120
number of websites create tracking

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
cookies before the user is even able to

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
give consent and some track users even

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
when the consent is denied

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
on top of this dark patterns are used by

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,580
by websites to influence new users into

66
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,860
accepting all types of data collection

67
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,620
even if this is not really in the user's

68
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,060
best interest

69
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,239
so all of this evidence shows us that a

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,159
solution is needed that doesn't require

71
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,700
users to trust the websites and our main

72
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,680
research goal was to find a way to

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
enforce cookie consent directly in the

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,700
client

75
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,000
and our solution to achieve this goal

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,980
was a browser extension which we call

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,920
Cookie block the key idea of our

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
extension is to look at the cookie data

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
so if the actual cookie that is on the

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,019
website we predict the purpose using a

81
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,599
machine learning model and then decide

82
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,819
on removing the cookie based on whether

83
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,159
the user actually consents to the

84
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,500
purpose that the classifier predicts for

85
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,580
the cookie

86
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,459
and to implement this we first gathered

87
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,860
a large data set of cookies with two

88
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,920
different web crawlers we then analyzed

89
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,379
the cookie structure to extract

90
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,599
numerical features from them to train a

91
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,440
classifier uh we yeah we then train a

92
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,959
classifier and evaluate the model and

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,000
finally this is integrated into the

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,159
browser extension

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,079
now for data collection the main

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,540
challenge was to find data sources with

97
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,399
cookies that were actually labeled with

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,680
purposes so if you simply crawl for

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,479
cookies you don't actually have this

100
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,340
information

101
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,840
luckily we know from the gdpr

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,000
regulations that there exist consent

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,520
notices that that already contain this

104
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,740
information so because of the purpose

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,919
limitation now we target pop-ups that

106
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,680
are implemented on websites by so-called

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,500
consent management platforms and these

108
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,960
are third parties that host the code and

109
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,780
the content that is used by the consent

110
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,800
notice

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,520
and well we selected the cmp's cookiebot

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,160
onetrust and terminally because these

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
had all the information

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,419
these specific four categories that we

115
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,340
needed to train our model so these

116
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,520
categories are strictly necessary

117
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,099
functionality analytics and advertising

118
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,620
um to retrieve this data we as I said we

119
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,419
implemented two different web crawlers

120
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,060
the first one simply identifies whether

121
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,820
the website we target uses one of the

122
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,440
supported cmps

123
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,259
so as input we gave it 6 million domains

124
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,720
from the from the Tranquil list and the

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,300
crawler identified 37 and a half

126
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,400
thousand domains that one had one of

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,460
those cmps the second caller emulates

128
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,020
real browsers and it uses the open WM

129
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,020
open wpm framework as a basis it

130
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,600
extracts the Declarations from the

131
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,060
consent notice and also the real cookies

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,419
through browsing and this was successful

133
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,900
on 30 000 websites now here you can see

134
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
the results of the second crawl we found

135
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,340
2.2 million cookie declarations in total

136
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,039
and on Earth

137
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,740
approximately 600 000 observed cookies

138
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,680
and so to get the training data set of

139
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,720
course we had to match the the

140
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,940
Declarations which had the purpose with

141
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,699
the real cookies which we you for this

142
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,500
we use the name and the domain of the

143
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,759
cookie and this gave us roughly 323 000

144
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,960
uh training them training data samples

145
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,120
now interesting to note here is actually

146
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,060
that we have many more declarations than

147
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,919
observed cookies which may be a

148
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,560
limitation of our crawler it cannot

149
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,900
fully interact with the website so maybe

150
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,199
not all cookies are generated and at the

151
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
same time however many of the real

152
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,940
cookies that we found at the website

153
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,039
were never actually declared in the

154
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,380
consent note is so this could be

155
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,440
actually a potential violation of the

156
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
gdpr because the websites do not provide

157
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,600
information on those cookies and we will

158
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,000
actually look at this later in our

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
analysis

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,080
and another interesting thing is that

161
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,080
when we look at how this uh how the

162
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,840
collected that cookie declarations are

163
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,259
split up by category we see a lot more

164
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,419
advertising cookies and this reinforces

165
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,000
that cookies are really mostly used for

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,740
tracking

167
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,960
now to be able to train the classifier

168
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,380
well each cookie is is by itself just

169
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,539
textual data and we need to transform

170
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,660
this into numerical features so we this

171
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,240
was not done in Prior work and we

172
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,099
defined over 50 different extraction

173
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,099
step steps the full list can be found in

174
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,960
our paper and I will give you two

175
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,560
examples so the first is the entropy of

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
the cookie value so the entropy

177
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,699
identifies Randomness the higher the

178
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,639
entropy the higher Randomness and this

179
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,000
could help the predictor identify unique

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
identifiers and unique identifiers are

181
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,599
of course often are used for tracking

182
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,180
a second example feature are content

183
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,680
encoding so we often identified Json

184
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,539
comma separated values and base64

185
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,360
encodings as also as separate features

186
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
which could also help the predictor

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,759
identify the context

188
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,680
so for training the model we use the

189
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,259
xgboost algorithm because it was one of

190
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,819
the best performing among different

191
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,860
approaches that we tried and it also

192
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,840
achieved great performance in previous

193
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,539
applications for classifying yeah for

194
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,419
yeah classifying to data and as a

195
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,000
baseline we use the Wikipedia repository

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,580
which is a database of cookies this has

197
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,160
that was manually assigned to purposes

198
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,500
by human experts

199
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,160
and so also cookiepedia records roughly

200
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,860
categories for approximately 70 percent

201
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,940
of our data set

202
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,640
evaluation we can see that

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,880
um the performance of cookipedia We

204
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,459
compare the performance of Wikipedia to

205
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,279
our best XG boost model and the

206
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,500
performance the balance accuracy of our

207
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,920
model is 84.2 percent almost which

208
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,380
compared to the 85.7 percent of

209
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,720
cookipedia shows that the classif our

210
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,019
classifier can predict purposes almost

211
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,839
as well as human experts and here you

212
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,260
can also see that while cookipedia is

213
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,779
maybe more accurate is at classifying

214
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,140
necessary cookies our classifier is far

215
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,180
more accurate for advertising cookies

216
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,360
and thoughts may give a higher privacy

217
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,860
guarantee

218
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,500
so as the final step we integrated the

219
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,720
model into our browser extension cookie

220
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,120
block and cookie block when you install

221
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,180
it it only asks users once instead of

222
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,519
being asked on every website

223
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,279
afterwards once the user has defined

224
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,700
which purposes he accepts the extension

225
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,399
predicts purposes for all cookies that

226
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,680
arrive and those that are rejected are

227
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,779
immediately removed

228
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,240
now

229
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,519
so cookie block is already we made this

230
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,779
available for users on major web so the

231
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,040
other major browsers but we know we

232
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,019
managed to so we identified a main

233
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,580
challenge with this actually so the

234
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,440
there are

235
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,500
necessary cookies may now also be missed

236
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,959
also misclassified because the

237
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,660
classifier is not completely accurate in

238
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,420
all cases and this can cause websites to

239
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,720
break of course and we try to evaluate

240
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,540
how serious this issue is by looking at

241
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,100
100 different randomly sampled websites

242
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,800
85 of the websites worked without any

243
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,320
issues but we found that the

244
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,360
authentication was broken on seven

245
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,240
websites and another seven we found that

246
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,880
the consent pop-up were reappearing even

247
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,399
if the user accepted them or clicked on

248
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,860
a button and on a single website we

249
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,060
found issues with language changes so to

250
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,000
mitigate this problem we implemented

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,220
functionality so that users can grant

252
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,260
exceptions to websites so that the

253
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,240
cookies from that websites are no longer

254
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,839
removed we can also or we also support

255
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,540
the

256
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,600
an exception list which users can report

257
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,040
broken sites and we will and we

258
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,640
Define these cookies as necessary so the

259
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,160
the websites no longer break

260
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,560
finally with the data we collected in

261
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,140
our crawl we were able to perform a gdbr

262
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,620
compliance analysis on the web and

263
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,740
here we defined six novel methods which

264
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,140
we list in this bar chart we will not go

265
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,300
over all of the I will not go over all

266
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,920
of them in detail because of time

267
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,920
constraints but here are some of them

268
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,459
so first we

269
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,140
Google analytics cookies are of course

270
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,959
very well known they are used for

271
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,420
analytics but still many websites

272
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,680
misclassify them 8.2 percent of the

273
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,860
websites we analyzed and on 2.7 even

274
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,160
these are classified as necessary by the

275
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,180
websites

276
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,880
and this was actually even ruled as a

277
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,060
gdpr violation in a previous court case

278
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,940
the planet 49 case so we are pretty sure

279
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,860
that these are

280
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,700
yes gdpr violations we also again here

281
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,740
have the Undeclared cookies cookies that

282
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,660
were never listed in the consent notice

283
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,279
and

284
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,399
we found these on a surprising 82.5

285
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,339
percent of all websites and overall 40

286
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,959
percent of all cookies that we found

287
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,000
were Undeclared

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,620
moreover We examined previously applied

289
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,260
analysis which are

290
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,060
um cookies that were set prior to the

291
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,279
user's consent and also cookies that

292
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,680
were set despite the user rejecting

293
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,200
consent and we found those on almost 70

294
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,040
percent of the websites and uh 21 of the

295
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
websites respectively Which is higher

296
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,260
than what was previously indicated in

297
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,000
Prior work

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,579
so finally in the histogram you can see

299
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,040
the number of websites that have this

300
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,899
exact number of different violation

301
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,260
types of what we analyzed and here we

302
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,560
see that only 5.3 of the percent of the

303
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,440
websites show no potential violations

304
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,160
this again justifies the need for our

305
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,339
extension for client-side

306
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:49,079
categorization of and removal of those

307
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,339
cookies

308
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,380
so and this concludes the presentation

309
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,380
to summarize cookie consent notices are

310
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,899
absolutely broken and if we want to

311
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,120
address this we need to address this at

312
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,880
the client side to do so we crawled a

313
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,040
large training data set of cookies we

314
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,200
extracted the extracted their features

315
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,180
trained the classifier and integrated

316
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,519
this into a browser extension and we

317
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,760
found that on almost 95 of our websites

318
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,720
there were potential gdpr violations

319
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,019
now thank you for your attention and oh

320
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,300
yeah and actually on this QR code you

321
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,420
can actually download uh all our

322
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,220
artifacts source code and even the

323
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,980
browser extension itself real feel free

324
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,019
to ask me or my co-author called

325
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,079
kubichek who is also here any questions

326
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,239
if you have them thank you for listening
