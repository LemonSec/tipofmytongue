00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,240
hi I'm changing from joseon University

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,799
today I'm going to talk about our recent

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,780
work on the security autonomous vehicles

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,660
which is rolling cars I also laser

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,980
exploits against traffic light

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,180
recognition

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,119
this work is collaborated with judging

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,320
Dr Xiao Richie and Dr benansi

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,119
let me get started by introducing

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,800
traffic light recognition

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,440
traffic lag recognition is a system that

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,079
enables vehicles to detect and recognize

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,660
traffic light signals it is essential

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,940
for full autonomous driving especially

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,760
in urban areas and companies like Tesla

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,680
have already implemented this system on

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,020
their vehicles

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,579
so how does traffic light recognition

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,600
work

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,340
there are three steps

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,800
first a camera captures the front view

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,079
of the vehicle into an image

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,020
and then the image is processed by the

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,180
traffic light detection model which

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,339
detects the presence and prediction of

26
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,320
the traffic lights in the image

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,420
and finally the traffic light

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,400
recognition model recognizes the color

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,979
of the traffic light

30
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,619
well what will happen if the traffic

31
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,840
light recognition goes wrong such as

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,900
generating a wrong output

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,360
the consequence is pretty obvious

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,520
if a red light is recognized as a green

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,540
light

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,180
the vehicle may run and write like and

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,540
cause intersection accidents

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,700
if a green light is recognized as a red

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,720
light

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,820
it may cause a sudden stop to the

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,040
vehicle and potentially to rear end

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
crashes

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,619
so from a security perspective a runner

44
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,479
it is possible for an attacker to make

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,939
the above accidents happen by spoofing

46
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,340
traffic light recognition

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,500
well it is possible at least you could

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,020
use fake traffic lights and a few cases

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,299
have demonstrated the visibility

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,119
however it is probably not the best idea

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,399
because fake traffic lights are easy to

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,619
detect and difficult to deploy in

53
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,660
practice

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,620
and in this study we use laser laser is

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,319
a form of light that has a very narrow

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,900
beam of radiation which means that it

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,780
can travel a long distance and is is

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,700
hard to detect

59
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,860
some paper Studies have shown that laser

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,900
can interfere with cameras such as

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,819
blending the camera and makes it

62
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,620
impossible to recognize anything in that

63
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,700
image

64
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,520
however in our attack we need something

65
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,260
different other than blinding

66
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,120
here's the text nearer detector

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,280
generates a laser signal using a laser

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,680
dial the answer shoots the laser into

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,480
the pocket camera

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,459
the the interferred image will go

71
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,959
through traffic light detection and

72
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,260
recognition and hopefully it may cause a

73
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,900
wrong output of the system

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,239
to achieve a successful attack we

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,379
mentioned that there are three

76
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,879
requirements

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,819
first the laser interference has to test

78
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,980
to affect the image as little as

79
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,440
possible so that the attack can be more

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,420
stealthy

81
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,180
second the attacker has to ensure that

82
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,040
the traffic light has can still be

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,800
detected under the laser interference

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,560
and third the traffic light has to be

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,980
recognized as being in a targeted color

86
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,500
and these three requirements have to be

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,959
achieved at the same time and it is

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
unknown whether this is possible

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
for the first requirement we started all

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,959
the possible effects of laser experience

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,180
the most common effects are overexposure

92
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,540
color shift and weight and balance

93
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,180
however none of this is what we want

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,760
because the laser affects the entire

95
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,180
image and can be easily detected

96
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,940
so to make the text out there we

97
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,159
designed a new method that can inject

98
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,860
the color stripe into the image that

99
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,659
only overlaps with the traffic like

100
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,159
region

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,299
so how to generate a cutter strap

102
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,920
we exploit the vulnerability of the

103
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,900
Rolling shutter mechanism

104
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,019
in all cameras there is a image sensor

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,180
that is made of an array of color

106
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,798
sensing pixels

107
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,839
a rolling shutter means that the pixels

108
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,840
are recorded line by line instead of

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,720
capturing the entire frame all at once

110
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,479
in this way the first line is recorded

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,419
first and then the second the third and

112
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,900
so on enrolling sequence

113
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,960
the problem of this design is that when

114
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,580
you're taking picture of something that

115
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,280
is moving or changing fast then you will

116
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,919
get some some all pictures like this

117
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,840
and it is all because the different

118
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,479
parts of the image are not captured at

119
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,740
the same time

120
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,919
and unfortunately most cameras use

121
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,020
rolling shutters including those on

122
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,180
vehicles

123
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,120
by exploring the vulnerability we can

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,040
inject a color strap into the image

125
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,800
using a laser pulse signal

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,960
the color stripe will only appear on the

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,540
lines that are recorded at the same time

128
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,139
when there is a laser interference

129
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,419
but adjusting the laser pulse parameters

130
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,419
the attacker can have full control over

131
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,840
the straps number wrist and position

132
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,060
and by synchronizing the laser pulse

133
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,400
with rolling shutter Pier the attacker

134
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,440
can make the stripe appear at the same

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,660
position in continuous radio frames

136
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,460
as for the second requirement the

137
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,979
injected Counter-Strike must not affect

138
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,900
the traffic light detection

139
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,940
we find that there are two record deaths

140
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,759
the first is the proper control of the

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,320
laser intensity

142
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,020
because if the laser is too powerful it

143
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,780
can hide the traffic light

144
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,060
the second is the proper design of the

145
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,280
striped service and position

146
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,800
for example the color stripe can cover

147
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,380
the entire traffic light or only a part

148
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,520
of it

149
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,100
our experiments show that for both red

150
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,979
laser and green laser the accuracy of

151
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,660
traffic light detection is very

152
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,360
effective if the traffic if this if the

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,979
stripe covers the entire traffic light

154
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,020
region

155
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,660
for the third requirement we consider

156
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,699
both red to green and green to Red

157
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,960
attacks

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,060
our preliminary experiments showed that

159
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,520
the attack is visible but it is also

160
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
non-trivial

161
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,660
for example in the two figures we sweep

162
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,000
the Laser's intensity and measure the

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,560
confidence score of the traffic light

164
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,940
recognition

165
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,880
we find out to achieve a successful

166
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,600
attack

167
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,360
the leader's power needs to be in

168
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,819
specific ranges or values

169
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,580
and besides Laser's power we find that

170
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,740
the tax result is also affected by the

171
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,900
latest incidence angle that the traffic

172
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,120
light itself and even the image

173
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,620
background

174
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,080
and therefore to ensure a high success

175
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,720
rate the attacker needs to fine-tune the

176
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,699
laser parameters according to the

177
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,039
specific traffic lights and text mirrors

178
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,259
based on the above observations here is

179
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,699
our thread model

180
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,699
before the attack the attacker prepares

181
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,099
a set of pre-recorded images of the

182
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,020
target traffic light

183
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,819
this should simulates the attacking

184
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,660
software

185
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,419
and finds the best combination of

186
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,520
effective laser parameters that can

187
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,220
smooth track light recognition

188
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,740
during the attack the attacker generates

189
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,319
a laser using the effective parameters

190
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,300
and show the laser into the target

191
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,440
camera

192
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,380
and hopefully the laser can produce the

193
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,120
attack without similar to the simulation

194
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,220
to generate the latest signals there are

195
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,800
several key attack building blocks

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,620
the first is the attack modeling that

197
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,900
simulates the laser interference

198
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,060
which involves camera modeling laser

199
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,979
interference modeling and Laser effect

200
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,259
emulation

201
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,360
then we use Greaser to find the

202
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,099
effective laser parameters

203
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,440
and finally we map the laser parameters

204
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,539
to real laser signals

205
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,000
and due to time limits please refer to

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,440
our paper for more details

207
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,660
we have evaluated attack using real work

208
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,599
on five cameras and two still VR traffic

209
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,120
light recognition models and one of the

210
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
cameras is the actual sensor used on

211
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
Tesla vehicles

212
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,500
in this dictionary setup the laser the

213
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,020
camera and the traffic lights are fixed

214
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,539
and embarrassed State businesses

215
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,099
positions and directions

216
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,380
we measure the tax overall performance

217
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,420
and study the impact of the traffic

218
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,760
light

219
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,220
for the overall performance the average

220
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,040
success rate is 20 for the red green

221
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,700
attacks and 45 for the red for the green

222
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,700
to Red attacks it is actually good news

223
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,339
because it suggests that running a very

224
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,100
light will have a lower chance than a

225
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,580
sudden stop

226
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
the attack performance also varies

227
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,640
depending on the camera and to our

228
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,940
surprise the camera used on Tesla is the

229
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,140
most vulnerable throughout Tech

230
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,600
the performance is also affected by the

231
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
traffic lights distance position and

232
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,959
direction

233
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,080
for example the attack success is

234
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
lowered as the traffic light is more far

235
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,839
away within 25 meters

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,660
and success rate is higher when the

237
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,220
traffic light is in the middle of the

238
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,459
image

239
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,220
we have also evaluated the attack on we

240
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,860
have also evaluated the attack on moving

241
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,080
vehicle from three perspectives

242
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880
the effectiveness of course continuous

243
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,519
video frames the feasibility of tracking

244
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,800
and Laser aiming and the end-to-end

245
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
impact on driving

246
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,360
we find that for both red green and

247
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,640
green to Red attacks the attack can

248
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,140
continuously spoof traffic light

249
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,180
recognition for more than one second

250
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,500
with a success rate of 85 percent

251
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,959
and to facilitate camera tracking and

252
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,940
Laser aiming we build and attack

253
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,220
equipment by combining the laser Dell

254
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,320
and the telescope

255
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,779
using this equipment the attack can

256
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,480
injector the attacker can inject laser

257
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,399
into a vehicle's camera from 43 meters

258
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,160
away even if the vehicle is moving at 20

259
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,779
kilometers per hour

260
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,120
and due to the unstableness of manual

261
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,519
aiming from a distance the success rate

262
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,800
is slightly lower than the stationary

263
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,140
setup

264
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,360
we studied the tax potential end-to-end

265
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
impact Polo running in the LG as well

266
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,640
driving simulator the simulation shows

267
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,680
that the attack is sufficient to make

268
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,200
the vehicle run a red light or make an

269
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,660
emergency stop

270
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,180
to mitigate the threat future cameras

271
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,399
may use Global shutters more instead of

272
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,860
rolling shutters and we also propose to

273
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,079
improve rolling shutters by sufficient

274
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,300
to a random rolling sequence that can

275
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,240
dissolve the cutter strike

276
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,120
in summary in this work we propose an

277
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,160
attack that exploits the vulnerable

278
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
rolling shutters and cameras

279
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,940
the attack and spoof traffic

280
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,160
determination using laser and

281
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,399
potentially cause self-driving accidents

282
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,440
and I guess the key takeaway message

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,600
here is that when designing future

284
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,880
systems we need to consider the

285
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,279
limitations of the hardware and we

286
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,800
should never ever trust the sensors for

287
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,899
granted

288
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,180
and that's all my talks thanks for

289
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,540
listening
