1
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,460
this talk is on a work we did at the

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,280
censored Planet lab about 18 months back

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,680
we conducted a large-scale investigation

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,080
into Geo differences in the mobile app

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,480
ecosystem

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,960
The Story begins thus I whatsapped a

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,939
LinkedIn profile to my friend in Russia

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,000
and she told me that LinkedIn is taken

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,460
down in Russia and the app itself is not

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,860
available on Google Play Store

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,200
our lab is very diverse and we keep

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
hearing about many such instances of app

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,540
unavailability worldwide but what we

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,600
don't know is how pervasive are these

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,079
occurrences and how many such apps basic

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,660
apps are not available to users

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,879
worldwide

18
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,699
so how does unavailability look like to

19
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,000
a user what you see here is a screenshot

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,180
of the LinkedIn app as seen on Google

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,540
Play from the US as you can see the app

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,240
is available the install button is

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,040
on the home page

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
in contrast

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,380
in Iran the app is not unavailable

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,200
is not available the install button is

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
missing

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,920
and in Russia the home page itself is

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
missing so what this highlights is the

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,700
fact that users access to apps vary by

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,280
their geolocation now that's about

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,979
availability

33
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,560
we also know of instances where

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,560
developers release regionalized versions

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,259
of apps to certain countries

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,960
so this raises another question now

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,439
do these apps have jio differences in

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,298
their security and privacy features

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,640
prior research on the web ecosystem has

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
highlighted inequities in access to web

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,520
content and services with censorship and

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,740
you are blocking by developers being

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,979
significant enablers of such inequities

44
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,959
research has shown that service

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,080
providers given an option tend to block

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,020
content indiscriminately effectively

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,620
isolating entire countries as such

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,420
now despite mobile users far surpassing

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,540
traditional internet users not much is

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,260
known about app equity in terms of Geo

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,660
differences in availability security and

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,220
privacy

53
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,400
we thus conduct the first large-scale

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,680
study that measures

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,340
two fundamental facets of app Equity one

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,040
at a given point in time

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,980
is an app available to users in

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,959
different countries across the world

59
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,019
and two if available

60
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,420
do these apps differ in their security

61
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,580
and privacy offerings

62
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,099
now conducting such a large-scale study

63
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,319
is non-trivial because we wanted to

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,379
collect a snapshot of the apps as seen

65
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,040
on Google Play from tens of countries at

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
the same time

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,720
we wanted to collect our binaries their

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,180
metadata and their privacy policies at

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,180
the same time so this in itself raises

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,739
several questions

71
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,099
now does the user's view of Google Play

72
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,140
Change when access from a residential

73
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,180
Vantage Point inside the country versus

74
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,099
a VPN Vantage Point inside the country

75
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,800
and our tests show that the view is

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,300
consistent so we chose vpns and vpss

77
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,580
now these vpns and vpss are they

78
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,799
reliable do they have good speeds can

79
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,319
they handle long-running downloads does

80
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,900
their advertised geolocation match that

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,060
of Google's

82
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,599
third in case of download errors how do

83
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,940
we eliminate transient network errors

84
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,580
and root cause the right actor

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,099
responsible for these failures

86
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,459
fourth what are the runtime factors that

87
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,500
can impact measurements for instance

88
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,140
what is the app churn that these are app

89
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,720
markets see in terms of updates

90
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,580
five

91
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,858
given that this is a comparative study

92
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,139
we wanted a representative list of

93
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,280
globally popular apps and countries

94
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,280
factoring in all these challenges we

95
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,320
designed and implemented a

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,320
semi-automated measurement test bed that

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,139
allows parallel downloads from tens of

98
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,300
countries and thousands of applications

99
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,900
from 26 countries essentially

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,620
and these countries also include

101
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,900
countries such as Egypt Zimbabwe Iran

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,300
and Tunisia where acquiring Vantage

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,460
points were significant Challenge and

104
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,220
also extremely expensive

105
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,940
May curate a list of 5684 apps which are

106
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,479
globally popular from 22 ad categories

107
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,360
that we computed to be popular and also

108
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,580
include essential categories like

109
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,979
education news books medical Etc

110
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,479
effectively we collect one of the

111
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,759
largest multi-country AB data sets in

112
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,600
the community with over 117 app binaries

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,479
and metadata and over 112k privacy

114
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,360
policy instances

115
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,600
that said we also see many apps being

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,880
unavailable in different countries and

117
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,759
we wanted to know the actors responsible

118
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,259
for these failures

119
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,419
but as you can see here this is a list

120
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,639
of all errors we get from our downloads

121
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,080
from these app markets but

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,220
intuitively just simply mapping the

123
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,500
errors to these actors was non-trivial

124
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,539
those there was no transparency in the

125
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,940
errors essentially so we went through a

126
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,560
whole bunch of control experiments to

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
root cause these errors starting with

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,580
publishing our own test app on Google

129
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,100
Play and subsequently downloading it to

130
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,380
see what errors we get

131
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,139
we individually tested app downloads on

132
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,240
different devices with different service

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,460
providers we reached out to developers

134
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,620
like Mozilla and only to confirm our

135
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,840
findings and finally also checked on

136
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,880
Google support groups to confirm our

137
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,020
findings

138
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,520
essentially

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,620
to give you an example there are

140
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,139
multiple actors at play for here for for

141
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,000
instance here

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,060
in the LinkedIn app in Iran the blocking

143
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,880
we saw was by the developer versus in

144
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,280
Russia it was an instance of take down

145
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,039
which we know was directed by the

146
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,219
government

147
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,460
we go back and characterize base these

148
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,919
uh unavailable apps based on the errors

149
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,880
we find

150
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,660
and we determine that after 5684 apps

151
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,419
about three six seven two apps are

152
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,300
geoblocked in at least one country with

153
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,940
blocking by developers significantly

154
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,300
high in all countries and app categories

155
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,139
thus blocking by developers is a big

156
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,240
enabler of Geo blocking in the mobile

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,460
app ecosystem

158
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,280
Tunisia and Iran are the most Geo block

159
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,860
countries with basic apps like Microsoft

160
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,620
Office reader and and Google Books being

161
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,240
unavailable

162
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,060
we also cluster these countries to look

163
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,520
for similarities in app unavailability

164
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,639
and we find Regional similarities for

165
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,560
instance in the EU countries in our list

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,919
we see a huge overlap of about 496 apps

167
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,360
being blocked

168
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,080
of which eight are blocked only in EU

169
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
possibly because of gdpr and this

170
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,720
includes popular apps like USA Today and

171
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,020
the large gay dating app called blued

172
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,199
countries like turkey Ukraine and Russia

173
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,599
are also clustered together and we see

174
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,940
high instances of app takedowns or our

175
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,660
blocking actually in turkey and Russia

176
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,720
we observe 61 in instances of country

177
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,240
specific takedowns with South Korea

178
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,300
having the most such instances of 36 app

179
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,080
takedowns of which 17 are gambling and

180
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,599
game apps which we think is consistent

181
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,759
with South Korea's policies on content

182
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,000
regulations in these applications

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
we then compare these apps for geo

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,680
differences in security and privacy

185
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,660
features mostly static features in this

186
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,500
work

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,220
we first do a strict binary diff of

188
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,159
these applications

189
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,260
596 applications showed your differences

190
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,500
in binaries of which 11 have the exact

191
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,260
same user user-facing versions

192
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,099
we find 127 apps with your differences

193
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,459
in permissions of which 49 of them

194
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,100
request additional dangerous permissions

195
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,700
only in select countries Bahrain Tunisia

196
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,920
Canada and Germany are the countries

197
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,279
where apps request the most extra

198
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,740
dangerous permissions and lifestyle and

199
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,899
dating apps have the most additional

200
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,600
dangerous permissions for instance date

201
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,140
my app date my age is a dating app that

202
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,420
has got record Audio Only in 11

203
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,339
countries

204
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,000
we see 23 instances of apps enabling

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
clear text communication three of which

206
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,140
are VPN for instance rocket VPN doesn't

207
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,420
have to be found

208
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,440
and 118 apps with additional ad trackers

209
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,959
with Iran and Ukraine having the most

210
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,019
additional ad trackers with some apps

211
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,060
containing up to 15 more ad trackers

212
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,959
there

213
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,140
gaming entertainment and social apps are

214
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,120
the app categories that have extra eye

215
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,600
trackers

216
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,519
we observe your differences in privacy

217
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,519
policies as well 103 apps with your

218
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,860
differences and we see that countries

219
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,660
that are not protected by any data

220
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,399
protection regulations are under higher

221
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,220
risk for instance 71 apps from Google

222
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,040
have additional classes to come comply

223
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,040
only with gdpr in the EU and CCPA in the

224
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,459
US privacy policies of 57 apps that we

225
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,899
downloaded could not be downloaded

226
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,959
because of server side blocking and 28

227
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,940
apps that request dangerous permissions

228
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,279
make no mention of it in the Google

229
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,500
policies despite Google's mandate to do

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,339
so

231
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,459
now now the Geo differences aside we

232
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,800
also see some very basic privacy policy

233
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,620
violations for instance we see apps

234
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,240
containing missing privacy policies

235
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
because of broken links or even apps

236
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,000
that we direct to news websites when the

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,399
privacy policy link is clicked we also

238
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,500
find instances of nonsensical privacy

239
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,899
policies like this you see here this is

240
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,339
just a requirement by the Play Store an

241
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,220
example of a nonsensical policy

242
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,440
to recollect we see large scale

243
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,420
differences Geo differences in app

244
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,240
availability security and privacy in the

245
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
app ecosystem and this race is a very

246
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,920
important question by granting more uh

247
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,680
developers unmoderated control and by

248
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
being lacks about auditing R D's global

249
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,800
app markets contributing to internet

250
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
splintering

251
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,380
and effectively exposing users worldwide

252
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,959
to higher security and privacy risks

253
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,180
to overcome the gaps identified in this

254
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,100
study we make a few recommendations in

255
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,680
the paper for one app markets can start

256
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,779
with providing clear signals as in the

257
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,579
web ecosystem where there's error codes

258
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,640
for attributing app and availability

259
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,220
they can make transparent the take down

260
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,079
requests and the rational for these

261
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,180
requests in their transparency reports

262
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,820
they can also provide good hooks for

263
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,339
auditing developer behavior for instance

264
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,040
by releasing a developer's app release

265
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,620
history which enables third-party audits

266
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,079
for instance they can also improve their

267
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,880
wetting engine to factor in Geo

268
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,860
differences and push Developers for

269
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,680
better transparency finally these app

270
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,500
markets can also may also host privacy

271
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,019
policies on their websites to ensure

272
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,240
availability worldwide and also better

273
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,620
vet privacy policies

274
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,959
that said our code and the result of

275
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,300
this work is available at geodif.app

276
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,219
thank you open for questions
