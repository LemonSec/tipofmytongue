1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm here to present lamp phone which is

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,960
Optical passive sound recovery from a

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,720
desktop light bulb this paper was also

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,820
recorded by your own pirating Professor

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,100
addition professor and Dr borisadov

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,220
so there is such question that we try to

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,260
resolve or to answer in this research

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,440
was can a desktop bulb be used as a

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,700
microphone

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,059
so the answer is that by using

12
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,460
scientific tools to analyze the

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,920
vibrations of a light bulb

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,800
attackers can effectively recover high

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,780
quality speech and none

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,640
speech audio

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,340
but let's start with the warning

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,680
um turning a light bulb into a

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,940
microphone

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,579
is somehow very very challenging task

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,280
now probably some of you are wonder why

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,619
and the fact is or the primary reason is

23
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,119
because light bulbs were not exactly

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,040
designed to be used as microphones so

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,619
throughout the next 12 minutes I will

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,060
try to convince you that you can force

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,340
them and recover a perceptible speech

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,320
from them

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,240
okay so let's briefly review the related

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
work in this area

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,820
um in recent years various non-acoustic

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,619
methods to eavesdrop sound were

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,220
introduced by our community

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,020
these methods mostly can be divided into

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,299
two main categories to primary

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,439
categories

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,240
the first category is the internal

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,759
methods which are methods that obtain

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,700
data by using a device mostly

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,100
compromised device which is co-located

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,920
in proximity to the Target

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,100
and under this uh topic it was

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,259
demonstrated how for example data

44
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,360
obtained from motions installs or even

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,000
magnetic data that was obtained from uh

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,820
a hard disk can be used to recover

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,920
speech

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,960
the second category is the external

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,219
methods

50
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,740
um which are methods that rely on data

51
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,800
obtained by a sensor or device that is

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,800
not collocated with the with the victim

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
or with the uh

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,920
the Target and there are two primary

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,599
methods under this topic the first one

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,700
is the Liza microphone which utilize a

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,260
laser transceiver in order to recover

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,580
speech

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,140
and the second one is the visual

60
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,239
microphone which

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,720
um obtains data from high frequency

62
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,480
video camera and

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,160
analyzes the vibrations of objects to

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,680
recover uh speech for example it was

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,379
demonstrated by the guys from MIT that

66
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,060
they can recover speech from a bag of

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,580
chips they recover a speech from a bag

68
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,560
of chips

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,260
however each of these methods is uh

70
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,400
Limited in one of the following

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,739
characteristics some methods require the

72
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,480
attacker to compromise the device with

73
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,180
the malware other methods are active

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,360
which means that they give indication

75
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,440
regarding their use

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,660
some methods cannot be applied in real

77
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,580
time due to the fact that they require

78
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,080
very or heavy computational resources

79
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,080
and other methods are limited at

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,599
recovering speech at scrim levels so

81
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,060
when I say skim levels it's about 85 DBS

82
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,720
and more

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
now let's review lampon's threat model

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,099
um

85
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,720
model we assume that the sound from the

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
victim's room creates fluctuations on

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,940
the surface of the desktop light bulb

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,019
which basically turns into a diaphragm

89
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,500
now Dave's Locker directs a photo diode

90
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,280
at the light bulb VI telescope and

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,720
by doing so it actually turns the the

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,420
photo diode into a transducer the

93
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,940
optical signal is then sampled by the

94
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,519
photo uh from the photodiode is sampled

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
via an a2d and process using an

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,980
algorithm which I'll review later on

97
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,599
now bear in mind that from an

98
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,400
eavesdropper perspective

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,299
um

100
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,780
lamp one is really risky because it is

101
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,480
external which means that it doesn't

102
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,738
rely on compromised device it doesn't

103
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,238
require the attacker to compromise the

104
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,639
device in order to obtain the data it is

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,139
passive so it means that it doesn't give

106
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,440
any indication regarding its use it can

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,340
be applied in real time and moreover it

108
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,040
can recover speech in normal volume

109
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,259
levels normal volume levels are about 75

110
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,740
DBS which equivalent to the level of a

111
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,960
virtual meeting

112
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,880
okay so let's review some of the

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,560
physical analysis which is associated

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,419
with the lamp phone

115
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,840
and in a nutshell sound waves which

116
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,139
produced by speech hit the light bulbs

117
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,000
surface

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,919
uh the light by vibrates according to

119
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,780
the sound waves which are the vibrations

120
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,940
basically modulate the speech or this

121
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,440
nearby sound and turns into a diaphragm

122
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,900
uh the light bulbs vibrations create

123
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,139
very very small changes in the distance

124
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,680
between the light bulb and the static

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,800
photodiode uh when I say very small

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,940
there are

127
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,280
maximum 55 microns according to

128
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,840
measurements that we took from a

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
gyroscope

130
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,759
and the small changes in the distance

131
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,160
between the surface of the bulb causes

132
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,740
the photodiode to Output different

133
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,560
voltage levels which basically serve as

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,300
Optical measurements which are then

135
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,240
sampled by day to D

136
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,340
and the optical measurements modulate

137
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,160
the sound near the light bulb with some

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,680
additional side effects

139
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,460
now the exact analysis uh

140
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,440
in the paper shows basically how

141
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,139
attackers or iflockers can determine the

142
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,180
sensitivity of the equipment they need

143
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,400
in order to recover speech from a light

144
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,220
bulb based on the distance they want to

145
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,320
recover from

146
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,240
now let's review the optical acoustical

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
transformation algorithm and we

148
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,100
basically isolate the audio from the

149
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,860
optical measurements in a few steps the

150
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,840
first one is we take the raw data the

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,780
optical measurements we then apply some

152
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,280
bandstop filtering and some high pass

153
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
filtering the high pass filtering is in

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,280
order to filter the low noise in low

155
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,380
frequencies the best the best of

156
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,780
filtering is used in order to um

157
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,319
filter harmonics of the the LED which

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,580
are captured in 100 and 200 Hertz Etc

159
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,580
we then scale the distance you can see

160
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,620
how scaling basically improves the

161
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,139
signal to noise ratio and we also apply

162
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,139
some some spectral subtraction which is

163
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,539
a dynamic method to

164
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,400
um

165
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
denoise signals which doesn't assume

166
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,440
anything regarding the distribution of

167
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
the noise

168
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,460
and finally we use some equalizer in

169
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,620
cases where the signal is not good

170
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,419
enough or whether the response is not

171
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,479
equal across the Spectrum

172
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,479
okay so let's review the evaluation

173
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,539
um first of all we try to compare the

174
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,340
performance of the lamp phone to visual

175
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,800
microphone as I mentioned before visual

176
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,199
microphone was demonstrated by a group

177
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,020
from MIT about eight years ago they

178
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,360
recovered speech from a bag of chips

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,139
using a very uh

180
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,720
using high frequency video camera

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,580
we actually replicated the same

182
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,780
experimental setup used by the guys from

183
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,819
visual microphone we used an illuminated

184
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,819
table lamp which we placed on on the

185
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,919
office in the office we use the exact

186
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,520
same six sentences from timid repository

187
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,759
um for this experiment

188
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,160
in this case we use the same speech

189
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,599
level which was 95 DB this is very very

190
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,300
um I would say loud volume

191
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,160
the optical measurements in this case

192
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,919
were obtained from three meters away

193
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,479
again as in the case of visual

194
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,340
microphone and we place the speakers at

195
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,819
the same distance from the bag of chips

196
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,160
that they placed in our case it's from

197
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,099
the light bulb which was five

198
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,660
centimeters away

199
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,120
so I want to convince you that you can

200
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,720
uh heal or recover very good sound I

201
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,360
will play the original speech and then

202
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,620
the recovered speech so first of all

203
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,820
this is the original speech

204
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,339
she had your dark suit in Greasy wash

205
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,039
water all year okay this is the original

206
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,839
speech and this is the recovered speech

207
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,779
[Music]

208
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:54,180
okay let me play you another sentence

209
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,820
this is the original speech don't ask me

210
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,060
to carry an oily rag like that

211
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,260
and this is the recovered

212
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,339
okay bear in mind this was uh recovered

213
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,200
from light

214
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,180
okay so we analyzed the performance of

215
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,380
the lenphone and we got to the

216
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,700
understanding that the quality of the

217
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,100
recovered speech by lamp phone and the

218
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,200
visual microphone is about the same

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,420
level

220
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,300
now um the first experiment was done in

221
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,680
order to compare the performance of

222
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,160
lymphon to a state-of-the-art method we

223
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,740
try to do additional experiment in order

224
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,040
to somehow try to apply length on a more

225
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,800
realistic scenario and in order to do so

226
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,740
we try to test the ability to recover

227
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,100
audio from various distances under the I

228
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,540
would say the experimental setup of

229
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,420
virtual meeting we can use an

230
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,519
illuminated table lamp which we placed

231
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,860
in the office the speakers in this case

232
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,160
were set to 75 DB 75 DB is the

233
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,620
equivalent I would say uh sound level

234
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,680
for a virtual meeting

235
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,380
we play the famous statement uh by

236
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,060
Donald Trump

237
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,700
um the measurements in this case were

238
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,200
obtained from five meters to 35 meters

239
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,700
and the speakers in this case were

240
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,100
placed 25 centimeters away from the

241
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,820
light bulb now 25 centimeters away are

242
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,720
basically half of the depth of the table

243
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,060
of the desktop that you can see in this

244
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,500
case this is the table that was used

245
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,240
this is the light bulb this is the

246
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,940
speakers where we used to play the the

247
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,040
Trump statement that you were about to

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
heal and this is the telescope that was

249
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
used you can see the photodiode mounted

250
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,000
to the telescope the place where you

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,459
basically observe the uh from the

252
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:45,600
telescope

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
okay with that in mind

254
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,560
um

255
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,920
I want to play to you the uh the

256
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,320
original uh sentence and then you will

257
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,980
see the recoveries from five 50 meters

258
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,320
35 meters all of which were done where

259
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,839
the distance between the speakers and

260
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,700
the lamp was 25 centimeters

261
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,500
we will make America great again this is

262
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,800
the original

263
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,279
[Music]

264
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,600
this is from

265
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,500
[Music]

266
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,470
this is 25 meters away

267
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,549
[Music]

268
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,940
okay this is 35 meters away now as you

269
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,920
can see the signal or the quality of the

270
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,500
signal deteriorates with distance you

271
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,440
can compensate for the the deterioration

272
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,480
of the quality with the dedicated lens

273
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,120
this is the best that we were able to uh

274
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,079
to recover we will okay now as you can

275
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,880
see a perceptible speech can be

276
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,860
recovered from a distance of uh 35

277
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,620
meters at experimental setup of a

278
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,360
virtual meeting which again equivalent

279
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,779
to 75 decibels when the victim sits in

280
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,019
front of a desktop in a distance of 25

281
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,720
centimeters from the light bulb again

282
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,060
which is equivalent to half of the depth

283
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,319
of a standard desktop

284
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,779
now let's review the takeaways from

285
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,519
these stocks so first of all the first

286
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,720
Echo is perspective okay in 2022 you

287
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,180
should be more worried about smartphones

288
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,220
and laptops because they pose much

289
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,740
greater risk to individuals privacy than

290
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,079
the light bulb

291
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,180
um in this context lamp one is a

292
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,480
calculated risk a risk that should be

293
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,640
taken into account only after you

294
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,579
mitigated greater if dropping risks

295
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,579
posed by Internet connected devices with

296
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,180
integrated microphone and this your

297
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,700
smart watches smartphones and laptops

298
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,100
are probably post a greater risk to your

299
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,839
privacy

300
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,380
now the second takeaway is that probably

301
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,200
lamp fund was utilized in the wild 30

302
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,459
years ago

303
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,160
now probably some of you answer this is

304
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,899
again my opinion

305
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,519
um some of you probably wonder what is

306
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,560
the reason for this uh very extreme

307
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,420
argument

308
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,720
and in order to answer it let's review a

309
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,579
lesson learned from the Great Seal bug

310
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,459
which is also known as the thing

311
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,620
um the great sellback for those of you

312
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,000
are not familiar with it is an

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,459
eavesdropping device which was uh

314
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,100
concealed inside the picture that was

315
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,579
given as a gift by the Soviets to the

316
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,260
America to the American ambassador to

317
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,040
the Soviet Union okay it took the

318
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,620
Americans about six years to detect its

319
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,200
release and it wasn't detected or

320
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,760
revealed by the Americans it was

321
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,420
revealed by the British Embassy now

322
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,480
the reason that I mention uh this

323
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,760
specific case is because the Great Seal

324
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,399
bag is considered the predecessor of the

325
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,540
lfid

326
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,200
it was utilized or used by

327
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
um the Soviets

328
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,420
around the end of World War II at 40 at

329
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,040
1945

330
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,079
and patented in America about three

331
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,459
decades after

332
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,079
okay so basically what you can

333
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,260
understand it that those Gap three

334
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,779
decades between what is revealed by uh

335
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,180
to by uh to the public and what is

336
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,240
really used by the clandestine agencies

337
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,540
that intend to use the to recover speech

338
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,519
now with that in mind

339
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,200
I want to thank you for attending this
