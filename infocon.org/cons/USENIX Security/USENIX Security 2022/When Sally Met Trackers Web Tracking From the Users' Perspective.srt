1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,320
I will be presenting the the first part

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,639
of this talk and then my colleague

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,740
scander will be presenting The Following

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,639
part

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,980
so this is a joint work between eurocom

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,720
University in the south of France and

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,000
Northern LifeLock and we will be talking

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,300
about you know web tracking

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,519
so web tracking is a very hot topic

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,920
nowadays there are a lot of studies that

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,500
try to investigate tracking techniques

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,719
and how organizations are collecting

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,300
information from the user there are also

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,160
studies that try to measure how

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,379
prevalent web tracking is on the web for

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,059
example there was a study of two years

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,460
ago that by trolling the top 1 million

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,379
website concluded that for example

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,660
Google and Facebook are present in 40

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,480
percent and 18 of them

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,760
the main research question of our work

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,699
is that what does this mean for the user

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,860
so what about the user perspective or

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,260
web tracking for example

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,600
does the fact that Google or Facebook

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,260
are present in 40 and 18 of the top 1

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,720
million website mean that they know for

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,780
example the 40 and 18 of the user's

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,220
browsing history

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,220
and also can we say something on timing

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,799
so how many tracking organization how

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,600
fast and how frequently do users

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,460
encounter them

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,439
so to measure the real impact of web

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,060
tracking on users we divided these

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,680
studies in two parts

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,840
so the first part is about timings where

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,060
we try to answer questions like how many

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,579
of us and how frequently user encounter

40
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,979
trackers we also see whether there is

41
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,360
any correlation between the number of

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,400
visited websites and the organizations

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,259
the tracking organizations that are

44
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,600
encountered for example is it true that

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,579
if we visit more websites we encounter

46
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,900
more organization

47
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,000
and also how frequently do we

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,460
re-encounter the same organization

49
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,259
in the second part we will be talking

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,720
about the knowledge of trackers so how

51
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,060
many websites how many browsing is is

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,100
actually known to tracking organization

53
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,740
and if there is any strategy they can

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,560
use to increase this knowledge you will

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,660
also see whether tracking organizations

56
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,239
are interested in particular sensitive

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,160
information and particular categories of

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,140
website and also whether there is an

59
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,300
optimal tracking strategy and whether

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,099
some tracking organizations are

61
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,599
following it

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,540
so to perform this study we use Northern

63
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,480
level of telemetry about 250k users in

64
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,459
214 countries

65
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,500
and for each of them we have the day the

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,660
hour and the domain only accessed by

67
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,540
each user during one week for a total of

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,599
2.3 million distinct domains

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
what do we do is to build a custom

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,920
crawler visit each of the website and

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,739
retrieve tracking organizations and we

72
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,900
count more than 6K tracking organization

73
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,700
in our data set

74
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,940
so let's look a bit at the timing

75
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,160
we measure to answer the first question

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,340
how many tracking on average user

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,379
encounters during one week so the answer

78
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,200
is on average 177

79
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,720
but the main point here is that only

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,819
after two hours fifty percent of them

81
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,760
are already tracking the user and this

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,480
number raises to 84 in only 12 hours and

83
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,879
basically after one day the totality of

84
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,620
tracking organizations are already

85
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,360
tracking the user

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,340
and this brings us to the first you know

87
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,700
main finding of this work that is no

88
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,080
matter how many trackers do you

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,060
encounter at the end of the week well

90
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,680
they almost all of them will know about

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
you in a few browsing hours

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
for the second question whether there is

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,099
any correlation between a visited

94
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,440
website and encounter trackers well this

95
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,360
was quite straightforward as you can see

96
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,280
from this plot the There is almost a

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,540
perfect correlation

98
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,000
so in this plot each dot is a user and

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,500
on the x-axis you have the number of

100
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,720
visited websites on the y-axis you have

101
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,060
the number of trackers encountered

102
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,879
but actually the what we were interested

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,459
to find was a group of users that was

104
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,680
you know not following this trend and

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
actually what we did was to isolate the

106
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,940
outliers of this plot and we noticed

107
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,799
that for example there is a group of

108
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,280
user that is visiting a very few number

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,319
of websites but still encountering a

110
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,360
higher number of tracker and what we

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,339
found is that those user visit very

112
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,139
reputable website for example News

113
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,358
sports website that contain a lot of

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,860
tracking organizations

115
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,440
we found also that for those users the

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
security of the website is higher so

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
they visit more secure website

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,560
on the other end for the other group of

119
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,900
outliers is completely the opposite so

120
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,120
they visit less reputable website and

121
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,580
less secure website

122
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,620
to answer the third question so how

123
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,540
frequently do user encounter the same

124
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,000
trackers and also I mean this brings to

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,820
another question so is it possible to

126
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,400
prevent web tracking by simply deleting

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,380
the browsing history and I'll frequently

128
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,540
should we do it to avoid this

129
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,660
so here we have the top five tracking

130
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,639
organization in our data set and as you

131
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,040
can see from the rightmost column the

132
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,199
track user with a frequency that is

133
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,699
slightly above one hour

134
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,740
and I want to understand I want to

135
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,900
wonderline here that one hour is the

136
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,180
finest granularity we have in our data

137
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,340
set so probably this number is for sure

138
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,479
much lower

139
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,360
and of course as you can imagine the

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
conclusion is that if you want to

141
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
prevent web tracking by simply deleting

142
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,600
the browsing history you should do it so

143
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,699
fast that is a not a practical solution

144
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,539
so now we are going to speak about the

145
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,820
knowledge that these trackers have so

146
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,320
the next question will be how many

147
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,240
visited websites are actually known for

148
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,460
trackers right so first we're Savino was

149
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,720
talking about the different percentages

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,000
but here we see different because Google

151
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,940
actually has 64 of the user's browsing

152
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,560
history but if you remember the first

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,820
numbers that were commented in this

154
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,460
presentation this number was 40 if they

155
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,620
were analyzing the top 1 million

156
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,900
websites the same situation happens with

157
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,940
Facebook that originally had 30 percent

158
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,699
of the browsing history even before this

159
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,160
number was 18 so we see here that at the

160
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,500
increase of 24 in the case of Google and

161
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,539
12 in the case of Facebook which is

162
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,120
quite a big number it actually comes to

163
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,860
this conclusion right so users do not

164
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,139
visit a random sample of the top 1

165
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,940
million websites so analyzing it like

166
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,400
this will actually always take us to

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,060
another estimation

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,800
still these are lower bounds because the

169
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Crowder visited websites and analyzed

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,280
the specific domains but these are not

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,479
the only domains that they happen with

172
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,919
the user of rosin and there are many

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
internal domain connections that are not

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,220
visible with a simple crawling so we

175
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,080
have to take into account this and come

176
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,000
to the next question how much can this

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,620
knowledge increase when cooperating with

178
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,660
them among different trackers so we use

179
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,860
the information that was already

180
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,479
available from previous studies to see

181
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,100
how they come how the different tracking

182
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,600
companies were sharing data between them

183
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,940
and we found that in our specific case

184
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,280
with two organizations selling

185
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,780
information between each other they can

186
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,460
increase this number five or ten percent

187
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,979
but if we increase this number from two

188
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,840
organization to multiple organizations

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,960
this can increase up to 50 more so just

190
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,520
to give a couple of examples here we

191
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,500
have the graph that shows Facebook and

192
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,840
Microsoft so without sharing any

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
information Facebook was having this 30

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,280
that we're saying and Microsoft has 27

195
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,020
but if they start selling this

196
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,400
information between different companies

197
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,180
these numbers increase to 67 and 73 so

198
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,560
it's a large increase and this happens

199
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,060
because different tracking organizations

200
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,440
they don't act exactly in the same

201
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
domains so when they sell they are able

202
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,740
to match this information and track the

203
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,780
user in many more places

204
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,580
how much sensitive information is

205
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,500
actually known to these structures so we

206
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,599
take into consideration something as

207
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,580
sensitive based on legal documents that

208
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,620
is playing this and we see that

209
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,360
political Health sexuality Financial

210
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
religion and legal are the ones that we

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,780
are taking into account and for example

212
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,599
we see that in health 34 of all the

213
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:49,919
tracking organizations that we see in

214
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,479
our data set are actually present in

215
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,460
these categories which is like 2.2 K

216
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,780
more or less

217
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,759
and political is actually an interesting

218
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,919
case but because in this case we see 15

219
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,560
different organizations per website so

220
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
we see that there are many trackers

221
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,440
interested in this category and they are

222
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,319
present in many of these websites

223
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,300
so we see here the graph that we see the

224
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,340
different big trackers that we can see

225
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,900
in our data set and different categories

226
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,639
they are we see a correlation between

227
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,259
the information that they get but still

228
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,120
we see some categories such as the one

229
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,620
political that we were discussing about

230
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,819
that actually have a bit more impact on

231
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,979
the trackers and they can track the

232
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,360
people more

233
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,400
so The Trackers follow this optimal

234
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,900
tracking a strategy and what do we mean

235
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,760
with optimal tracking strategy is that

236
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,520
we run the top 5K website that based on

237
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,080
our data set are the most visited ones

238
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,458
so the ones that will be allow these

239
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,500
trackers to obtain more knowledge of the

240
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,179
of the different users in our data set

241
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,760
and we see that Google is in 66 percent

242
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,260
of those 5K websites Facebook is in 35

243
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,480
and Microsoft is in 17 but does this

244
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,279
mean actually that they can track the

245
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,860
user based on these numbers so this took

246
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,080
us to analysis of how much they will

247
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,540
know only with these 5K websites so in

248
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,680
the case that the attacker will be

249
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
present in the 5K website that we are

250
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,700
seeing as most important for our data

251
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,860
set we see that they will already get 78

252
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,600
of the browsing history of the users

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
which is quite a big number this number

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
will be reduced to around 50 in the case

255
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
of Google so they are not in this 5K

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,459
websites but they're in a big tank of

257
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,800
them so still they get like 50 of them

258
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
but then the most interesting case is

259
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,040
here where we have Microsoft and

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,779
Facebook so we're seeing the numbers

261
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,700
before that they were like nearly double

262
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,860
so Microsoft was in many less of these

263
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,720
5K websites but here there's still the

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,820
knowledge that they will obtain it's

265
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,019
pretty similar and this happens

266
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,600
principally because Microsoft is on

267
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,980
websites that are higher ranked that the

268
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,019
user are busy than most in this fight so

269
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,120
the top part of this 5Ks and Facebook

270
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,800
isn't the one that are lower bounded is

271
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,540
5K so still they get very similar

272
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,040
numbers even if they are present in many

273
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,660
less websites

274
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,580
so just to finish we'll have to give

275
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,680
some takeaways of this talk

276
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,440
so the first one is that the main web

277
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,480
tracking actors is now around two-thirds

278
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,040
more or less of the browsing history of

279
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,660
the users which is a bit percentage it's

280
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,100
much more than what you estimated before

281
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,140
analyzing the top 1 million

282
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,240
users do not visit a random sample of

283
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,279
this top 1 million websites because

284
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,959
analyzing them will lead to another

285
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,459
estimation

286
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,380
and finally no matter how many trackers

287
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,580
you encounter at the end of the week

288
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,459
almost all of them know you just in a

289
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,920
few hours of browsing

290
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
so thank you very much we'll be happy to

291
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,519
answer some questions
