1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:11,700
this is Joint work with Folks at UVM and

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,500
this is my first season I'm really

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,120
excited to be presenting my work here so

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,760
ready to jump in

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,960
so I hope I don't have to convince

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,480
anyone that platforms matter they

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,880
mediate interactions between human users

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,100
and so platforms provide critical

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,599
infrastructure for businesses and social

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,119
systems

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,920
and so any changes that occur on those

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,540
systems matter

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,579
uh and these changes might have

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,579
implications for firms and end users

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,020
so I'll give a couple of high profile

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,040
examples

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,020
a couple years ago Google changed their

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,680
logo to save space and so less space is

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,260
great for everyone

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,920
more recently Instagram changed their uh

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
content generation content serving

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,280
algorithm to favor more video content

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
and this meant that artists that use

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,840
Instagram to

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,399
contact their audiences had to change

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,960
their business model overnight and so

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,500
this was not great for Content creators

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,960
a couple weeks prior to that change uh

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,700
there was a report that Facebook had

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,260
considered changing its algorithm to

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,080
take uh to compete with Tick Tock

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
um and so when these changes are put

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,100
onto systems these are usually an

35
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,600
intervention with some sort of expected

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,780
result

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,479
and for many changes in software these

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,580
may be possibly imperceptible or may

39
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,560
have many types of effects and these

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,420
things might be hard to predict

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,700
so the question is

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,400
uh how did you decide what to change and

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,720
so the answer is to perform

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,299
experimentation

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,100
and so we can consider a couple of

46
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,020
different experimental contexts

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,240
might have a laboratory experiment

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,820
uh for example a University psychology

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,180
lab or a field experiment like a

50
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,460
platform in the wild

51
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,079
and in these systems there's information

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,799
asymmetry by Design

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,180
this is a century exists between the

54
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,340
participants and the experimenters

55
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,619
so I'll get a little more detail here

56
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,300
in general there are three pieces of

57
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,619
information you might be interested in

58
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,300
if you're in an experiment

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,060
uh want to know if I'm in the experiment

60
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,280
uh the experimental condition that is

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,540
being applied

62
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,220
and I might want to know the outcome of

63
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,360
Interest

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,819
and so if I'm an experimenter I get to

65
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,319
know all of these things

66
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,959
but if I'm not if I'm a participant in

67
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,819
the experiment there are reasons to

68
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,680
Shield the participants from these

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,879
particular pieces of information to

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,200
reduce bias in the estimates

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
and so the asymmetry is sometimes

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,620
necessary in the design of the

73
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,120
experiment

74
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,860
but it turns out participants don't like

75
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,140
to feel like they've been deceived

76
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,300
and so this may lead to some forms of

77
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,280
non-cooperative behavior

78
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
I can provide a bit of anecdata on this

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
so this is a screenshot from my Facebook

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,599
uh back in 2015. this is right after

81
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,700
they introduced their new emojis and

82
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,300
there's an article here posted that uh

83
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,920
suggests how Facebook wants to use these

84
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,780
this new Emoji data

85
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,120
and this particular user says the only

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
appropriate way to deal with this is to

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,060
use the wrong emojis for each situation

88
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,420
which I plan to do from now on

89
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,879
and so back when I started this work in

90
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,760
2015 uh work in which I work in machine

91
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,879
learning and uh was the General

92
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,500
reception was that this is a primarily a

93
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,060
theoretical question

94
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,819
um not a real issue however fast forward

95
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,680
to 2017 and uh there was evidence of

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,780
adversarial behavior in the 2016 U.S

97
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,819
election and meanwhile there's also

98
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,780
experiments running on Facebook for

99
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,900
several years to increase voter turnout

100
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,700
so this has implications for these

101
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,140
particular experiments that have been

102
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,640
running since 2010.

103
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,920
so uh we identified this model of

104
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
non-cooperative participation

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,640
we need to find a non-cooperative

106
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,860
participant or NCP as an individual in

107
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,540
the population who responds under an

108
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,860
intentionally different response model

109
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,659
than their true outcome when they're in

110
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,519
an experiment

111
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,959
our work is the first to Define this

112
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,040
Behavior with respect to online

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,760
experimentation

114
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,139
so what does this mean

115
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,180
so we have an individual

116
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,519
and if we're running an experiment then

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,019
we have some treatment that we're

118
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,759
interested in we'd like to measure the

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,320
effect of that treatment on some outcome

120
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,419
of interest that pertains to the

121
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,400
individual and so that individual's

122
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,320
Behavior May influence that outcome in

123
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,419
some way

124
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,280
and that their behavior may be

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,380
influenced by their belief that they're

126
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,240
an experiment or their values and these

127
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,680
are both hard to measure so they are

128
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,680
represented by these dashed lines

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,780
and their beliefs and values may also be

130
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,880
influenced by external information which

131
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,580
we may have some access to for example

132
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,400
knowledge of news articles or research

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
on the use of experimentation on

134
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,020
platforms

135
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,320
and so the user or the participant may

136
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,259
also provide statements that imply uh

137
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,180
their intent to not cooperate for

138
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,860
example this user on Facebook

139
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,159
so what do we do about all this

140
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,479
well information learning as I mentioned

141
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,919
and so we like to throw math at the

142
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,120
problem

143
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,340
and the idea is to correct for a

144
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,900
statistical bias in the estimator of

145
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,820
treatment effect

146
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,919
but how we do that depends on network

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,320
structure assumptions and the conditions

148
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,120
of the experiment this really grounds

149
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
out into two different contexts the

150
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,139
propositional setting where users and

151
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,240
participants can't influence the effects

152
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,280
of their the outcomes of other

153
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,199
participants and the relational setting

154
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,880
where participants outcomes May

155
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,900
influence the outcomes of other

156
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,360
participants

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,000
in the propositional setting uh if I

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
have only a small number of ncps in my

159
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,860
population this may induce a small

160
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,620
amount of noise in my estimate but I may

161
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,940
not be too concerned about this the

162
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,100
presence of these uh participants

163
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,660
however if there's a large number of

164
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,639
these participants in my population then

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,100
I might be concerned by about bias

166
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,039
that's induced by their behavior

167
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,720
however if I have access to something

168
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,940
like a statement that it signals intent

169
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,759
to participate in this way then I can

170
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,139
remove all of the non-cooperative

171
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,479
participants and retain my unbiased

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,940
estimate of the outcome of Interest

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
so in the propositional setting there's

174
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,020
a high overhead of NCP coordination to

175
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,460
induce bias

176
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,440
and we can compute unbiased estimates by

177
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,120
removing known ncps from the population

178
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,259
in the relational setting I'm concerned

179
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,000
about

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,020
researchers are concerned about the

181
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,139
spillover of treatment to other nodes

182
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,199
that may not be exposed to treatment

183
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,440
and in the relational setting estimating

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,180
individual and peer effects is a

185
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,620
well-studied problem

186
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,259
this is typically accomplished by

187
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,460
clustering the network and using a

188
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,319
cluster-based randomization design to

189
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,699
assign treatment to all nodes in a

190
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,800
particular cluster

191
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,539
in this work we study estimates of

192
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,979
average treatment effect which is the

193
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,180
overwhelmingly common model of

194
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,380
estimation in social science and

195
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,159
econometrics

196
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,020
however this design does not account for

197
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
non-cooperative Behavior

198
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,699
in particular there may be spillover of

199
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,340
the similar form but of NCP Behavior to

200
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,380
the behavior of neighboring nodes

201
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,900
so users May alter their behavior in

202
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,400
response to the expectation that they're

203
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,720
in an experiment

204
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,520
users May interact with others who are

205
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,199
also in the experiment causing estimates

206
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,520
of treatment effect to be tainted by

207
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,319
spillover or pure effects

208
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,419
and NCP Behavior May propagate in the

209
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,940
network via purefix if I simply remove

210
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,000
the ncps that I might be aware of like

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,520
this dark node in the center that

212
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,319
doesn't account for the additional bias

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,319
and fluid through the observation of

214
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,139
that outcome by neighboring non-ncp

215
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,440
nodes

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
to study this week conduct a bias

217
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,400
analysis

218
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
um and in particular we study the

219
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,919
effects of NCP location in the network

220
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,380
we study the greedy condition where

221
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,259
nodes must ncps most form a dominating

222
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,360
set meaning that all nodes in the

223
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,039
network are exposed to at least one

224
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,160
outcome from NCP

225
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
and we also consider the random case

226
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,379
where nodes are selected uniformly at

227
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,879
random to be non-cooperative

228
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,419
participants

229
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,180
in the experimental design for our

230
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,399
simulation studies the we consider two

231
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,140
critical design choices

232
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,599
these are the network structure which

233
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,880
informs how participants are connected

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,740
and the outcome simulation which informs

235
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,279
how participants respond to treatment

236
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,839
for an over structure we consider both

237
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,600
synthetic and empirical data we use

238
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,459
synthetic graphs generated to replicate

239
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,959
community structure

240
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,240
and we consider also a real world social

241
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
network subgraph

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,500
our outcome simulation model is drawn

243
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,720
from prior work and we also use a

244
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,279
non-cooperative participant model that

245
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,899
minimizes the effective treatment

246
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,720
and our synthetic simulations we find

247
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,459
that bias induced by NCP Behavior

248
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,959
increases linearly in the number of

249
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,240
non-cooperative nodes and that greedy

250
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,560
placement generally results in higher

251
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,600
bias than random placement especially

252
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,120
for large pure effects

253
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,380
the main takeaway here is that

254
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,200
relational context amplifies NCP bias

255
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,300
so I'll zoom in on one of these

256
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,440
particular results

257
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,200
if there was no bias induced by the NCP

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,519
Behavior then we would expect the orange

259
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,380
lines to be horizontal

260
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,180
and instead we see that there's increase

261
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,880
as we increase the number of ncps and

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,500
this increases much larger for the

263
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,700
greedy selection procedure

264
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,740
we've talked a lot about Facebook but

265
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,880
this happens on all kinds of social

266
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,279
platforms

267
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,680
and so the implications here uh because

268
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,180
Community structured networks are

269
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,160
particularly vulnerable to bias from NCP

270
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,899
Behavior this is what we've shown in our

271
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,500
experimental results

272
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
and this is a real problem on addressing

273
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,959
the research Community for online

274
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,180
experimentation

275
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,680
we provide a statistical correction

276
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,140
however this correction is not enough

277
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,820
the correction simply removes the

278
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,160
outcomes for ncps and participants that

279
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
are exposed to

280
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
NCP Behavior

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,000
and you need more than math

282
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,580
uh as future work we can study

283
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,200
alternative experimental designs that

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,959
are more robust to such Behavior

285
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,180
and in particular we hope that systems

286
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,380
Community researchers can help design

287
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,940
better systems for protections of end

288
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,300
users

289
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,140
in summary community structure networks

290
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,060
are particularly vulnerable to ate bias

291
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,339
from NCP Behavior and we need Creative

292
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,899
Design Solutions and experiments in

293
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,760
software systems not just mathematical

294
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,899
Corrections

295
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,500
thank you
