2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,000
thank you thank you for the introduction

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,740
have you ever used the continue with

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,719
Google button to log in to an app or

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:16,980
website

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,619
this is an example of single sign-on or

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,800
SSO and it uses an API to access basic

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,359
account information from your existing

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,400
Google account

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
in fact there's a whole ecosystem of

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,140
third-party apps that request API access

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,719
to Google user data like email and

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,180
calendar apps document editors that save

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,620
to Google Drive

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,719
and add-ons that work with Google Docs

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,120
slides and forms

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,860
when a user clicks to install a

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,960
third-party app for example the popular

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,539
Zoom meetings app they are presented

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,700
with a prompt that details the account

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,100
access permissions that installation is

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,440
authorizing

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,180
here we see that Google or excuse me

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,680
here we see that Zoom meetings is

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,020
requesting permissions to access the

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,059
Google Calendar API

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,880
the Gmail API and to connect to an

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,619
external service

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,080
despite the many benefits granting

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,580
programmatic access to one's online

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,860
online account can pose security and

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,580
privacy risks

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,380
Google provides the apps with access to

34
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,420
your account web page to help users

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,100
manage their apps

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,960
the page lists all the third party apps

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,759
that have been authorized to access a

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,880
user's Google account via Google apis

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,340
if you click on an app it will expand to

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,460
show you the permissions details

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,000
the date the access was granted

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,920
and there is a button to remove access

43
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,320
our study explores how users consider

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,420
the security and privacy of third-party

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,640
API access to their Google accounts

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,020
given the disclosure and control

47
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,420
mechanisms currently available

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,920
with that in mind we set up three

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,200
research questions first we wanted to

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,299
find out why users authorize or remove

51
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,939
API access and this includes measuring

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,280
users existing SSO and third-party app

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,780
use

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,119
second we wanted to understand users

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,220
perceptions and concerns regarding these

56
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,239
apps

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,459
and third we want you to know how users

58
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,560
would like to manage their existing API

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,900
authorizations

60
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,760
our study design consists of two online

61
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,040
surveys the first survey focused on

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
asking participants to recall prior

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,239
experiences with third-party apps and

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,319
ssos

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
and recruitment for both surveys was

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,040
done via prolific during the month of

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
April 2021

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,080
we invited back 399 participants that

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,060
have active Google accounts with ssos

70
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,459
and third-party apps to return for the

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,160
second survey and 214 of them completed

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,420
the survey

73
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,340
we created a custom browser extension

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,800
that collected in the wild data about

75
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,220
users actual ssos and authorized apps

76
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,019
the extension was also used to display

77
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,840
participants specific third-party apps

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,819
directly in the survey so we could ask

79
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,018
questions about these apps

80
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,860
um we'll now take a look at some of our

81
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,200
key results from the study

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
I will start by presenting why users

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,099
authorize API access

84
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,140
and the measurements of users existing

85
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,440
SSO and third-party app use

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,560
so results from the first survey found

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,180
that almost 90 percent of our

88
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,239
participants recall using a using a

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,620
Google account to sign into a

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,659
third-party app or service and over half

91
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,400
recall granting third-party app access

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,920
to their account

93
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,720
with the data collected from our browser

94
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,519
extension we found that 86 percent of

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,280
participants had at least one SSO linked

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,200
to their Google account and of those who

97
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
had at least one SSO the average number

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,239
of ssos per participant was 13. so not

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,400
only do many participants use ssos but

100
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,019
they also use quite a few

101
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,080
and we observed a total of 1010 unique

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
ssos

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,440
here's a list of the top 10 most

104
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,360
authorized ssos among our survey

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,700
respondents

106
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,680
and we noticed that six of the top ten

107
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,019
are authorized to access more than basic

108
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,180
account information showing that ssos

109
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,459
are used for more than just account

110
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,760
access for example Alexa and Microsoft

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,899
connecting to Google Calendar

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm using the data collected from our

113
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,459
browser extension we found that 67

114
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,680
percent of participants had at least one

115
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,060
third-party app with Google account

116
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,199
access

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,120
and of those who have at least one

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,160
third-party app the average number of

119
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,280
third-party apps per participant was six

120
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,759
and we observed uh a total of 455 unique

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,600
third-party apps

122
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,320
here's the list of top 10 most

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,060
authorized third-party apps among survey

124
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,740
respondents

125
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,100
and based on the date authorized the on

126
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,660
average apps have been authorized for

127
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,960
over 285 days with the maximum being

128
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,180
authorized for almost seven years so

129
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,000
these third-party Ops stay on users

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,820
accounts for a long time

131
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,520
now I will present the results of users

132
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,860
perceptions and concerns regarding apps

133
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,280
with API access to their accounts

134
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,020
we presented participants with their

135
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,080
newest and oldest apps by install date

136
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,639
along with a random app they had

137
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,660
installed

138
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,100
when asked if they were concerned about

139
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,560
the app having account access a quarter

140
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,780
of participants agreed or strongly

141
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,699
agreed that they were concerned and

142
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,380
would asked if the access was beneficial

143
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,900
over half agree half agreed or strongly

144
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,880
agreed that it was that it was

145
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,419
beneficial

146
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,740
when asked to explain their reasons for

147
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,320
concern common response themes included

148
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,720
concerns about access to personal or

149
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,280
sensitive information

150
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,979
unnecessary access and access to

151
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,900
contacts and email

152
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,300
participant 61 responded a response when

153
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,759
responding to the quora app said I

154
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,080
didn't know that they could see and

155
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
download my contacts that is a bit

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,560
concerning because I don't know what

157
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,900
they do with that data and participant

158
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,060
63 when explaining their concern about

159
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,820
the boomerang for Gmail app said as with

160
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,860
any app that requires having access to

161
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,960
send emails I'm always worried about

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,060
something unauthorized being sent

163
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,320
among the six most prevalent permissions

164
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,520
participants reported view personal

165
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,660
information

166
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,759
and modify contacts to be the most

167
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,979
concerning while participants were less

168
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,259
concerned with broader permissions such

169
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,639
as modify Google Calendar

170
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,840
the relative lack of concern with these

171
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,819
permissions could be attributed to a

172
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:33,919
transfer

173
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,380
of trust from to Google from third-party

174
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,979
apps for example participant 117 said

175
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,020
it must be okay since it partnered with

176
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,960
Google and participant 161 added I

177
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,520
generally trust anything that leads to

178
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,620
that Google SSO page

179
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,180
transferring trust to Google is

180
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,039
misplaced and concerning because Google

181
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,039
is only providing the API capability and

182
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,720
may not be aware of how third-party

183
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,819
services use Google accounts they have

184
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,360
access to

185
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,919
we also ask participants to report the

186
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,440
necessity of each permission for the app

187
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,020
to function among the six most prevalent

188
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,419
permissions 61 percent of participants

189
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,460
reported the permission to view personal

190
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,759
information to be not necessary or only

191
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,340
slightly necessary and 41 percent of

192
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,259
participants reported the permission to

193
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,840
modify contacts to be not necessary or

194
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,360
only slightly necessary

195
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,340
participants found permissions such as

196
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,220
modify Google Calendar and Gmail and

197
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,500
view Gmail addresses necessary for app

198
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,599
functionality

199
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,240
and lastly I will present the results on

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,919
how users would like to manage their

201
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,340
existing API authorizations

202
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,199
we found that people never or rarely

203
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,300
review single sign-on

204
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,660
or third-party app authorizations

205
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,639
and this can lead to concerns about

206
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,620
stale account access

207
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,900
participant 137 complained about their

208
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,360
Adidas training app I have removed the

209
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,280
app from my phone and I don't see why

210
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,780
the app still has to have these

211
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,220
permissions

212
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,960
participants were concerned because they

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,599
equated removal of mobile apps on their

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,220
phone with the removal of API

215
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,620
authorizations and were surprised when

216
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,000
that wasn't the case

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,979
their account with that app continues on

218
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,740
and that is what has the API access

219
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,539
and participant 16 said of the chat

220
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,879
books app I don't use it anymore and

221
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,139
they still have access to my photos

222
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,919
when taking the second survey we had

223
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,720
participants interact with their own

224
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,620
apps with access to your account page

225
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,599
and almost half reported that they would

226
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,500
change

227
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,419
their settings after completing the

228
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,360
survey and 71 percent reported that they

229
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,099
would review third-party apps in six

230
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,480
months

231
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,040
when asked what they would change a

232
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,080
review common response themes included

233
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
removing account access from unused apps

234
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,660
and changing specific permission access

235
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,820
participant 23 said I would definitely

236
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,740
remove many of the apps I do not use

237
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,959
anymore they absolutely do not need to

238
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,219
be linked to my Google account anymore

239
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,360
and when asked what new features they

240
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,399
would like to help manage app access

241
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
common new feature requests included

242
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,140
detailed permissions explanations data

243
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,940
access logs and permissions level

244
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,260
control

245
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,800
for example participants 17 says I think

246
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,540
it would be useful for them to show when

247
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,820
I last used an app and when the app last

248
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,620
used my data

249
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,019
and participant 156 responded Auto

250
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,060
removal of apps after three months of no

251
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,239
use

252
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,060
This research identifies the need for

253
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,100
limiting account access for unused

254
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,940
forgotten or removed third-party apps

255
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,740
study participants expressed the most

256
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,720
concern about access to personal

257
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,660
information like email addresses however

258
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,160
they were less concerned with broader

259
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,260
access to calendars emails or cloud

260
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,640
storage

261
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,380
some suggested design improvements

262
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,240
include the ability to designate

263
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,220
specific account data as private and

264
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,779
inaccessible

265
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,660
fine-grained permission controls

266
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,320
improvements to the permissions

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,540
descriptive text and adding a recent

268
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,399
activity log that includes data access

269
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,060
details

270
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,740
thank you and I would be happy to take

271
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,160
any questions
