1
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,059
I'm going to present the paper under the

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,059
hood obtains Management in SMTP

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,800
so then let's start

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,080
then is a skirt protocol that is

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,460
designed to enable authentication or

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,199
communication peers without reliable

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,600
shares so the first finding over a paper

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,880
is the 130 percent of self-hosted

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,119
incentive servers mismanaged thing also

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,800
we found that ninety percent of

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,840
extensive servers conduct kill robots

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,100
incorrectly

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,860
then why this mismatchment happens

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,180
let's figure out the reasons

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,399
first I introduced what pain is and also

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
the motivation obtain

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,960
as you know in the country cam model

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,399
usually certificates are used for secure

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,460
communication and shares issue them

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,780
however

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,460
shares can issue certificates to any

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,340
domain name and there are so many shares

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,500
so we have no choice but to trust rhs

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,319
issue certificates properly

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,600
however there have been some accidents

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,939
the shares were compromised and it will

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,020
be issued throughout the land

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,600
certificates such as seasonal time or

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,320
Commodore cases so these issues broke

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,820
our face in the shape-based became

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,619
border

32
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,659
to solve this problem some mitigations

33
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,000
were purposed such as certificate

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,340
Transportation transparency or tennis

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,659
Gia

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,060
however as you can see all these

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,400
Solutions still work based on shares so

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,200
which means that they cannot eliminate

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,360
the root of the parable

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,640
so in this context the input core was

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,720
proposed

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,000
then enables domain owners to bind their

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
certificate or public keys to their

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
domain names without alignment shares

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,840
so for this domain owners can publish

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,000
their certificate or public key as they

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,119
can select called KSL code

48
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,299
also to support them our domain has to

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,000
support qnsa to guarantee the Integrity

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,399
of theater selectors

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,140
let's import details about deploying

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,040
thing

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,939
here

54
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,000
example.com wants to support them

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,280
then first it publishes its certificate

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,739
or public key to its 10 server as a

57
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,180
cheerle cell record

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,760
also as I mentioned before the domain

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,739
has to support tnsf

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,560
for this the domains published density

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,080
records such as tnst key rsql test

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,620
record to its 10 server here DSL records

63
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,480
have to unload to their parent Zone in

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,340
here.com John to establish a DNS

65
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,480
Exchange

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,700
root Zone and taco early supporting a

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,920
sec so these things exchange from the

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,780
rotation to the example technology can

69
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,160
be established

70
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,080
for more details about the answer please

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,360
check our paper

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,680
then how does the invalidation works

73
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,120
client wants to connect to the theater

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,739
server

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,080
and first it features TLC like course

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,239
and tensile across of example that comes

77
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,160
John

78
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,379
and then it validates the DNS exchange

79
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,319
of the Chelsea electrodes also if you

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,120
actually certificate from the TRS server

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,760
and finally compare compares the cheerle

82
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,560
cell across with the certificate if they

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
are matched or not

84
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,640
if there matches then they establish a

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,840
Terrace session

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
so this is then

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,819
and currently 10 is mainly used with SNP

88
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,819
protocol

89
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,920
is a protocol for electronic wave

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,720
transmission

91
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,480
however sntp has no strict features in

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,239
its initial design so Star Trek's

93
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,640
protocol is used to use ntp for

94
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,440
opportunistic shares

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,659
however the problem is that star chairs

96
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,659
is vulnerable to downgrade or text

97
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,840
but if Dane is used with smhp this 30

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,299
standard text can be mitigated

99
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,760
for example here if on a scientific

100
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,200
client wants to know whether the

101
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,959
example.com support TRS it just needs to

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,940
check whether the domain has a careless

103
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,220
electron so in other words

104
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,739
the existence of Terrace electrode is an

105
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,840
explicit signal of Terror support

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,299
so now nowadays stain is mainly used

107
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,760
with a centipede

108
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,860
so in this way thinking sort of critical

109
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,659
problems with solving for

110
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,360
and how Dan is deployed nowadays

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,220
in our previous work using X created

112
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,978
2020s we found that less than one

113
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,440
percent of tacom standard RG domains

114
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,759
deploy thing

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,979
unfortunately the deployment rate is

116
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,360
quite low

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
but we also founded

118
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,979
show very high to prevent ratio due to

119
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,919
financial incentives from registries

120
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,139
next we also check whether the domains

121
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,120
correctly deployed in

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,340
to support them correctly domain has to

123
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,780
support cancer and structures correctly

124
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,660
our domain has to publish RLC or TSC

125
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,240
Lacross twists tennis server and also

126
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,820
provide certificates to support start

127
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,840
shares

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,220
moreover

129
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,680
gas exchange should be cracked and the

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,419
certificates have to be consistent with

131
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,280
Terror selectors

132
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,440
however our findings revealed zombies

133
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,460
measurement

134
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,340
about 20 of Tracy records cannot be

135
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,500
validated due to density problems such

136
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,240
as machine test records in the tennis

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
Exchange

138
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,360
first we found four percent of

139
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,340
certificates cannot be matched with

140
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,320
their cherry selectors

141
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,540
then why this mismatchment happens which

142
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,060
is our motivation of the current paper

143
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,039
so in this paper our research question

144
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,020
is what are the underlying underlying

145
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,699
reasons that domains fair to support

146
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,860
them correctly

147
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,120
in the server-side time management

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
actually there are two main entities TNS

149
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,180
and sntp server so first we focus on two

150
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,699
manages each server

151
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,680
each server can be serve for state or

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,199
outsourced for example if you purchased

153
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,880
a domain name from code ID you can

154
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,440
manage your tennis representative server

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,380
by yourself which is surfhosting case

156
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,780
also you can let others manage this

157
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,419
their DNS or a scientific servers by

158
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,220
using Google hosting provider or

159
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,160
cloudflare which is outsourcing case

160
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,800
so as you can expect the quality obtain

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
management might be different based on

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,860
zoomances each server

163
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,100
so next we categorize the image entities

164
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,979
the first case is SMTP Outsourcing so

165
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,060
case

166
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,639
in this case our domain outsources is

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,400
incentive server total hosting provider

168
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,020
then according to the dance hierarchy

169
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,020
the DNS server is also outsourced

170
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,180
many hosting providers this option and

171
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,979
this is an effective and Powerful way to

172
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,060
support them

173
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,520
however domain owners lose their control

174
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,259
over same measurement because they

175
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,160
cannot control kns residential servers

176
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,979
the next case is scsu case

177
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,500
in this case a domain owner surfhost is

178
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,780
a scientific server but our sources is

179
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,639
10 server to other hosting providers

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,620
like Cloud Player

181
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,620
the last case is ssds case

182
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,020
in this case a domain owner surface

183
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,680
hosts sntp and TN server

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,380
so for this study we collect data set we

185
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,300
create domain students records such as

186
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,139
tlsa and 10 stag records like RC TS and

187
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,560
also nsmx and Lacross also we collect

188
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,840
certificates from SMTP servers

189
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,940
we collect data set from our second

190
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,340
level domains under.com.net technology

191
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,460
and tablet C for two years through daily

192
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,080
and artists cast

193
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,360
using this data set we identify major

194
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,580
entities for each domain

195
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,199
however it is very challenging to

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,060
identify amazing entities of each server

197
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,220
so we leverage IP address and other

198
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,680
things records and other informations to

199
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,199
identify for measles each server

200
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,360
if you're interested in details of

201
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,800
pathology please check our paper

202
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,300
now I showed our betterment features

203
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,099
t-scribe shows the percentage of domains

204
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,900
that incorrectly supports them for their

205
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,220
SMTP

206
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,120
as you can see ssdo and ssds case show

207
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,560
much higher in correct ratio than a

208
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,639
suitcase

209
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,860
in other words if domains surface their

210
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,419
essential server there can be more

211
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,620
errors

212
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,180
so we can know this Air Force thing is

213
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,180
ntp servers are more airflow

214
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,360
so next we focus on smt SMTP surfhosting

215
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,919
cases

216
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,360
and what are the reasons for obtain

217
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,160
validation failures

218
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,500
there are two main failure regions

219
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,539
kinesic failure and mismatch of

220
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,120
certificate and share Australia course

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,879
Genesis failure is a dominant reason for

222
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,159
obtain validation failures more than 90

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,919
percent of servers more than nine

224
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,839
percent of carry selectors

225
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,779
invalidated Q2 missing TS lab course

226
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,360
so we also found the 99 of Tennessee

227
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,000
failures actually crossed into tennis

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,860
Exchange

229
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,959
next we also found that about 20 percent

230
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,480
of SMTP servers have certificates that

231
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,440
are not achieved with their

232
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,080
corresponding TLC requests

233
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,779
so to figure out this reason next we

234
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,279
focus on the history of certificates

235
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,680
used by sntp servers

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,720
here we check the percentage of chair

237
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,940
selectors the denominated certificates

238
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,800
at the time of our scan but can be

239
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,240
matched with certificates previously

240
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,019
used

241
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,940
for example

242
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,980
if the criteria select code of the TN

243
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,779
server and the current certificate are

244
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,120
not matched then we compare the TSL

245
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,260
record with the previously used

246
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,700
certificate whether they're matched or

247
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,839
not

248
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,300
and this graph shows the result

249
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,279
this graph shows a percentage of Terrace

250
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,899
electrodes matches with outdated

251
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,820
certificates

252
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,920
as you can see as it consistent

253
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,959
WordPress histories you can find more

254
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,880
magic Theory cell of course

255
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,100
so from this we can know that this

256
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,839
matches are happening to choose tail

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,459
chair cell of course

258
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,220
also this result implies incorrect key

259
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,000
level behaviors

260
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,440
so from from the previous Square we have

261
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,820
noticed that kit tends to change over

262
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,160
time and also mismatches happen due to

263
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,959
stale Trader cell records

264
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,420
so next we analyze how domains conduct

265
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,899
killovers

266
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,339
is an update of public and private

267
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,959
keepers

268
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,360
and then the correct killover is defined

269
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
like this

270
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,779
on the scientific server indane has to

271
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,420
publish the uterusal record to 10 server

272
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,459
in advance less details before key

273
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,380
change because we have to consider James

274
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,959
caches intense reservers

275
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,600
so for example people domain has

276
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,480
Terraces and key like this

277
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
then the identification will change is

278
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,920
to the new key at time Q driver

279
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
for the correct key Rover the uterus

280
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,120
electrode should be published at least

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,399
two to three people times Hillary

282
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,200
so this is the correct killer over to

283
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
find antenna FC

284
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,779
and this table shows the percentage of

285
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,760
extensive servers and domains the

286
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,899
incorrectly conduct kill Rover in the

287
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,300
surprisingly we found that both SNP

288
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,519
servers conduct killovers incorrectly at

289
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,180
least once

290
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,920
however this result brings another

291
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,540
question to us

292
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,000
actually a scientific servers in Den do

293
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,220
not have to change their keys if they

294
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,380
use the NTA routinely use this for their

295
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,300
utility of course the killer Rover is

296
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,180
not mandatory also 99 of authentic

297
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,160
servers in our data set use those two

298
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,500
usages what we saw that many incentive

299
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,060
servers conduct kill robots and even

300
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,620
incorrectly

301
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,660
for unfortunate analysis we found that

302
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,180
about 87 of certificates were issued by

303
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,399
rest encrypt as actual

304
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,680
this is interesting because Dane was

305
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,480
designed to break the Reliance to shares

306
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
but still many scientific servers to

307
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,420
rely on shares by using their

308
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,680
certificates

309
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,720
it looks normal at first glance however

310
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,620
it has a side effect

311
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,380
follow web certificate regulation and

312
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,839
short period period is one of them

313
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,060
so these two shares issue certificates

314
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,640
with very short period and therefore

315
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,560
this they automatically Leach their

316
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,820
leave certificates

317
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,920
as you know let's encrypt the issue that

318
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,360
left certificates every three months

319
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,839
which enforces kill robots in day

320
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,120
also this Reliance to shares in the

321
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,459
result other side effects when shares

322
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,740
change their certificates

323
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,600
let's see the example

324
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,640
dainty usage allows domain owners

325
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
published ta Orca certificate is a

326
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,779
theater seller code

327
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,000
usually this certificate is not changed

328
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,279
often so in this context

329
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,260
this result shows the percentage of a

330
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,000
scientific servers conduct lower volume

331
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,940
correctly when they use the NTA usage

332
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,160
as you can see the incorrect ratio is

333
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,500
quite low less than 10 percent

334
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,720
but we found explosion from October

335
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,120
2020.

336
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,579
to figure out the reason we we monitor

337
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,579
the certificates issued by Legend grid

338
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,680
and we found interestingly dirt

339
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,720
let's encrypt change it is intermediate

340
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,779
certificate on October 2020. let's

341
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,700
encrypt introduce the URL intermediate

342
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,040
certificate and we draw the old X3

343
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,680
intermediate certificate

344
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
this graph shows the percentage of

345
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,760
scientific servers they use certificates

346
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,100
signed by X3 or R3 intermediate

347
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,360
certificate

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,279
as you can see the pre-order

349
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,500
intermediate certificate transition and

350
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
the period of the explosion are lower

351
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,959
left

352
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,240
so from this we can know that a

353
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,860
scientific servers can use Ledge

354
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,360
encrypts Intermediate certificate as

355
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,399
arterial selector failed to load over

356
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,660
correctly

357
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,300
so this is another side effects at first

358
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,519
because many authentic servers rely on

359
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,700
Chase

360
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,440
so in summary in this paper we

361
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,940
investigated why domain is fair to

362
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,560
mentioned correctly

363
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,240
we leverage the reasons to retain its

364
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,339
management such as tense failures and

365
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,079
the reason of mismatches

366
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,579
if you're interested in other findings

367
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,200
please check our paper

368
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,060
also our data set and codes are

369
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,339
available on our website

370
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:45,660
thank you I'm happy to take any

371
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,899
questions
