1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
all right thanks Paul for the

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,519
introduction and good afternoon

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,860
everybody

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,960
today I will present to you our work on

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,779
a temporal measurement of malicious apps

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,240
on Android this is Joint work with

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,359
people at Northern LifeLock Junction and

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,779
parent one uh verbier

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,180
so when we think about malicious Android

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,780
apps there are many bad things that apps

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,600
can do and Google actually have a fairly

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,660
detailed taxonomy of what malicious apps

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,899
can be doing so we have malware mobile

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,360
malware which is uh you know they are

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,879
the apps that do very bad things so they

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,879
do fishing ransomware spyware and all

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,800
these kind of things

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,079
and then we have all these apps that

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,480
sort of fall in between in this gray

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,539
Zone uh which are called mobile unwanted

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,100
software and they do things like

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,619
displaying annoying ads

23
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,459
um

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,000
uh you know trying to collect uh

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,820
personal data and things like that

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,460
all of these apps fall under an umbrella

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,619
which is called potentially harmful apps

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,560
or phas so this is what we are studying

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,100
in this work

30
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,200
now the research Community the security

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,240
Community has been studying the problem

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,280
of malicious apps on Android for a while

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,420
and to do that uh they've been following

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,540
three main research directions

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,720
so the first one is looking at app

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,060
markets so crawling apps from App

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,000
markets

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
and Performing analysis on the apps

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,540
downloaded and so on on the metadata

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,240
from the markets and so on and so forth

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,240
this gives us an overview of what's

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,100
going on to some extent

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,299
but it misses a piece so we do not see

44
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,920
uh you know what happens once apps are

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,780
installed on devices how long do they

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,540
stay on devices what do users do once

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,899
malicious apps make it on their devices

48
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,959
and so on and so forth

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
the second category had users actually

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,180
install an app on their own phones so

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,520
these are research participants and then

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,220
these apps would collect data about

53
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,840
malicious apps running on those devices

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,599
now the challenge there is to recruit a

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,239
large enough group of people that makes

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,520
it representative

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,040
and finally the third category looked at

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,400
Network traffic from mobile isps so we

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,500
are not looking at markets anymore we

60
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,120
are not looking at devices anymore but

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,340
we are sitting somewhere in between

62
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,560
uh looking for traffic but we consider

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
malicious

64
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
and the issue there is that to identify

65
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,959
what is malicious we need to rely on

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,280
block lists

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,040
and lists of own malicious domains IPS

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,319
and so on which we know very well but

69
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,660
they can be limited and incomplete

70
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,819
so all these reasons

71
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,360
many open research questions so

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,360
first of all we don't know how long

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,420
mobile devices stay infected with these

74
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,840
phas so once a malicious app makes it on

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,700
your phone you know do you delete it

76
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,760
right away does it stay there for years

77
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,840
we don't know

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
similarly we don't know how long phases

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,700
on Android marketplaces and this is made

80
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,519
even more uh Tricky by the fact that

81
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,959
there are many marketplaces you know

82
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,580
obviously Google Play is the biggest one

83
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,319
but there are many others that are

84
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,120
vendor specific or uh you know

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,959
third-party marketplaces and so on

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,860
also do these phas migrate once they get

87
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,780
removed from a Marketplace do they move

88
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,940
to another one to stay active and what

89
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,220
are these Dynamics

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,860
and ultimately what are the implications

91
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,019
for Android malware resource in general

92
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,299
that we can make from by answering these

93
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,420
questions

94
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,099
so what we did as I said this was a

95
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,260
collaboration with the northern LifeLock

96
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,560
so they have a mobile anti-malware

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,839
product so we actually had this product

98
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,240
installed on uh user mobile phones

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,740
and what they do you know they have this

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,660
whole infrastructure of a analyze apps

101
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,759
they identify malicious apps they build

102
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
signatures and then they ship the

103
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,720
signatures to the devices

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,419
and then the devices had this app that

105
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,880
runs periodically identifying all the

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,740
malicious apps that are present on the

107
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,699
device

108
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,520
and then they warn the user about them

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,860
so we would collect all these metadata

110
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,100
from uh millions of devices around the

111
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,380
world to get a global view of you know

112
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,380
what's the status of Android phas and

113
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,199
answer all those research questions

114
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,479
and then on top of that we take this

115
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,940
Telemetry and we run it through virus

116
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,620
total to get a more comprehensive

117
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,340
set of malware signatures that may you

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,220
know go beyond the biases of the one

119
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,780
antivirus company that we were working

120
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,600
with and we also use ad class which is

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,840
this ml based system that takes virus

122
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
total reports and gives you basically

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,560
one label one malware family

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,360
uh for each app

125
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,220
so we ran a data collection for a year

126
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,720
between 2019 and 2020

127
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,820
we had a population of over 11 million

128
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,580
devices around the world and we

129
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,160
collected 3.2 billion events so these

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,380
are detections of malicious apps on

131
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,060
these devices

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,820
and this amount for 8.8 million unique

133
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,900
chateaus

134
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,800
so unique malicious apps

135
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,259
so the paper is very dense so we have a

136
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,000
lot of results a lot of measurements but

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,860
what I'm going to do is giving you some

138
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,900
highlights of our main results and our

139
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,759
main takeaways

140
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,620
so how long do phases on devices

141
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,080
well mobile antivirus products are

142
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,940
actually Limited in what they can do by

143
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,100
the Android security system the Android

144
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,479
permission system

145
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,180
so they cannot delete apps themselves

146
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,680
directly

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,080
so the only thing they can do they can

148
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,539
tell users I found these apps

149
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,340
please delete them

150
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,960
okay

151
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,360
and what we found is that users do not

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,400
promptly delete these apps so for

153
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,940
malware we find that these apps stay on

154
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,520
the device for more than 20 days on

155
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
average after being detected so after

156
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,240
the user was warned

157
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,479
and for the mobile unwanted software uh

158
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,539
it's a little less 13 days and this

159
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,160
might be because these apps tend to be

160
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,479
more annoying you know they will display

161
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,699
annoying ads or do weird things while

162
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,800
the malware might try to stay uh

163
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,340
stealthier

164
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,220
when looking at uh in Market persistence

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,440
so when we see

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,039
a detection oftentimes it has metadata

167
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,620
that tells us which app initiated that

168
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,560
download so we can see which apps were

169
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,319
downloaded from Google Play from Huawei

170
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,380
Market or however many markets are out

171
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,520
there

172
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,660
and so if we see two detections after a

173
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,580
certain amount of time for the same

174
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,380
malicious app coming from the same

175
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,780
Marketplace we can use that as a lower

176
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,819
Bound for how long was the PHA alive on

177
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,039
that Marketplace

178
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,380
and so we find that actually phas

179
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,360
persist on marketplaces for several

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,699
weeks so for example for Google Play

181
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,539
Store

182
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,900
they stay on for 77 days on average and

183
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,120
for Samsung Market they stay on for 56

184
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,860
days on average

185
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,680
I have to say that actually uh you know

186
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,180
Google Play Store for example they do a

187
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,280
lot of detections before the fact so

188
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,780
many apps don't even make it to the

189
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,220
market

190
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,860
most apps probably but those that do

191
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,840
stay there for a while which is

192
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,360
troublesome

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,120
and then finally we look at migration so

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,379
we find that phas migrate from popular

195
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,479
marketplaces let's say Google Play Store

196
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,360
after they get removed they migrate to

197
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,960
smaller marketplaces to keep operating

198
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,479
but we also see the opposite so we see

199
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,820
malicious apps that are first uploaded

200
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
on smaller marketplaces and then after a

201
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,320
while they make their way to the most

202
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,520
popular ones

203
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,799
and why because that way they can reach

204
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,659
more victims so we can measure how many

205
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,300
victims they reach at least within you

206
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,540
know our set of 11 million devices and

207
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,260
we can see that by migrating to larger

208
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,760
marketplaces like Google Play and Huawei

209
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,959
Market

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,060
they can reach up to 50 percent more

211
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,160
victims

212
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,860
all right

213
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,019
so what does this mean for Android

214
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,240
malware research so this this is kind of

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,500
showing

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,120
um

217
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,680
you know quite negative picture of

218
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,080
what's going on out there apps stay on

219
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,180
devices for a while so we are not doing

220
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,760
uh we're doing something wrong there

221
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,800
apps stay on marketplaces for a while so

222
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,360
we're doing something wrong there as

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,540
well

224
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,760
well first of all uh

225
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,459
there is this limitation of Android

226
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,640
mobile malware uh

227
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,519
tools that they cannot delete these apps

228
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,680
and one thing that could be done is

229
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,740
actually studying why people actually

230
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,440
install an anti-malware product in the

231
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,060
first place but then they don't listen

232
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,560
to what the anti-malware product is

233
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,640
telling them

234
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,860
maybe there is an interesting resource

235
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,440
Direction there for people in usable

236
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
Security on you know developing better

237
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,060
not just better warnings and things like

238
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,040
that

239
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
and from the marketplace point of view

240
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
it looks like marketplaces are not

241
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,459
really talking to each other when it

242
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,580
comes to malicious apps so if an app is

243
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,000
removed from One Marketplace it then

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,519
pops up on another one while sharing

245
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,839
this type of intelligence and previous

246
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,660
detections could actually help uh you

247
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,220
know getting rid of these apps or at

248
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,220
least raising the bar for um formal

249
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,920
issues users

250
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,779
and yeah as I said there are many more

251
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,420
results and many more measurements in

252
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,760
the paper so please go and read it but

253
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,620
this is what I wanted to tell you about

254
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,740
today and thanks and I'm open to

255
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,920
questions
