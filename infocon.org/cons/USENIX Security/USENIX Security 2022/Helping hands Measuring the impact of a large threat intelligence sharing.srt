1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,080
so thanks everyone you can hear me all

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,300
right okay I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,480
our study that we did with colleagues

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,279
from delft University of Technology

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,580
Kyrie 11 foresight security icon and Sid

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,100
and labs and I want to give a special

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,960
thanks to Victor lubusha who also

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,720
presented earlier today and we've also

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,240
got a distinguished paper award and he

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,880
did a lot of work for this paper too

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,380
okay

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,140
so I want to take you back to 2020 the

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,120
year of covid

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,120
when the who first coined the

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,719
coronavirus name of the virus

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,760
we saw a surge in registrations of

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,480
domain names related to the virus

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,180
with a peak in March where at some point

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,280
more than 5 000 new domain names were

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,440
being registered per day

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,180
on the right hand side you see an

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,640
example of such a website a very sketchy

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,680
web shop I didn't actually order

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,900
anything here but I want to remind you

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,720
that this is from a time when

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,280
the health guidelines weren't very clear

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,600
we didn't know what to do with this

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,720
virus and there were all these criminals

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,680
um

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,140
trying to make a buck from our fare and

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,659
this is something we've seen also with

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,939
natural disasters and other fear in the

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,040
public awareness that they try to

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,400
exploit

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,020
a tweet made the rounds and you can see

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,380
the Tweet here and it urged us cyber

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,820
Security Professionals to join a

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
community in order to do something about

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,920
all these scams and this fishing it was

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,960
called the community was called the

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,540
covid-19 Cyber threat Coalition you can

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,880
see its website in the back

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,159
and I'm just interested is there anyone

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,799
here who was a member of the slack

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,020
instance of this community

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,140
anyone in the room show of hands

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,240
no it could have been though because at

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,520
some point uh it says here a few

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,619
thousand members but uh in the end it

50
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,360
turned out that over 4 000 members

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160
joined the community because I wanted to

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,979
help out with this goal okay so we're

53
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,739
going to investigate this community

54
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,379
first its Mission what did they want to

55
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,840
achieve with the 4 000 people on Slack

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,819
the aim was by sharing information

57
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,060
across organizational boundaries to

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,940
generate threat information

59
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,780
that they wanted to share with the

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,760
broader public

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,940
notably they said they wanted to defend

62
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,459
hospitals and Healthcare organizations

63
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,080
and so in a way this was open source

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,620
threat intelligence and open source

65
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,540
means it was freely available freely

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,379
available for everybody

67
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,959
did it work that's the question of our

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,580
paper you can see here the three

69
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,459
research questions that we asked that we

70
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:54,660
studied in the paper and that we're

71
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,840
going to go through in this presentation

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,840
but I want to emphasize here that this

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,440
is really a special Community because

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,120
it allowed us to investigate these

75
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920
long-standing questions on cyber

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,220
security threats information sharing

77
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,200
and this was possible because these

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
people didn't come together because of

79
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,220
compliance you know it wasn't public

80
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,200
policy that mandated information sharing

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
it wasn't commercial incentives it was

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,879
intrinsic motivation

83
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,120
so that was interesting our methods

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,620
please have a look at the paper we used

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,720
qualitative and quantitative methods it

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,480
was a combination and for example we did

87
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,459
some interesting stuff with regularly

88
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,080
scraping these domains in order to find

89
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,940
out if interventions had occurred

90
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,480
against them

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,459
so first question how did this community

92
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,920
work

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,599
like I said over 4 000 people at some

94
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,080
point it was very active

95
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,299
and also quite professional

96
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,080
and had a number of outputs one was that

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,940
a group of Administrators quickly formed

98
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,099
and they started compiling these reports

99
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,739
these blog posts about ongoing active

100
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,659
scams and internet abuse at that point

101
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,700
related to covid

102
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,040
and these administrators were also live

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,099
streaming these Town Hall meetings they

104
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,120
called them

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,199
to try and inform and involve volunteers

106
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,019
okay but the main output was the block

107
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,300
list like I said there was a lot of

108
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,280
activity on slack but actually turned

109
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,800
out that just a few users actively

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,259
contributed to the structured data

111
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,540
format Alien Vault otx that would be

112
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,280
used to generate a block list so that

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,380
was kind of a shame

114
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,060
but something we've seen also in other

115
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,240
communities the same pattern

116
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,479
and also we saw that users submitted

117
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,440
domains nips but also companies and over

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,500
time the company submitted data eclipsed

119
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,699
the user submit the data

120
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,919
does making this information available

121
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,080
to everybody actually help does it

122
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,199
improve the ability of Defenders to act

123
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,160
so we looked at interventions

124
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,500
against the domains that were listed in

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,520
the block list of this community and we

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,720
distinguished two categories that you

127
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,960
can see in this figure here on the left

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,639
hand side you see all the domains in the

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,440
block list and on the right hand side

130
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,720
you see the domains that Were Somehow

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,360
related to kovid which we distinguished

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,080
using a list of keywords in 15 languages

133
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,139
like n95 for example the masks

134
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,180
okay

135
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,160
the difference between the two figures

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,979
is that for the orange and the blue line

137
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,680
which are Registries and registrars

138
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,259
the community the CTC managed to add

139
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,759
more information so they improved

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,720
performance

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,180
they provided information that was new

142
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,740
to the Registries and registers at the

143
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,259
moment of publication specifically for

144
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,380
the covet related domains so that

145
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,139
was quite nice that was actually

146
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,720
somewhat of a surprise

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,220
and the other line in this figure is

148
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,320
Google save browsing the green line and

149
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,639
it from very well overall

150
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,120
um

151
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,979
you can see the quality the the fact

152
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,199
that this list managed to add new data

153
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,600
by the fact that it was included in the

154
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,280
security DNS provider quad 9.

155
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,900
Okay so

156
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,780
does this collaboration in a large group

157
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,300
actually lead to better coverage of

158
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,720
threats

159
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,680
we said yes it can but unfortunately the

160
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,060
way this community worked and performed

161
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,440
their fitting of these domains that were

162
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,960
submitted it kind of watered down the

163
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,520
quality of The Blacklist which I'll show

164
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,419
you

165
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,819
how this worked was that from all the

166
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,800
submitted domains the community

167
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
administrators wanted to provide some

168
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,039
level of assurance that it was actually

169
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,319
true positives that it was malicious

170
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,120
so how they did this they used

171
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,280
virustotal right you want something to

172
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,160
scale they use various total in a soar

173
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,620
integration and if there were fewer than

174
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,560
four varistotle scanners that said that

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,479
a domain was malicious it would be

176
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,680
thrown out

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,120
between four and ten a group of

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,460
volunteers would look at the Domain and

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,380
more than it will be definitely included

180
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,360
on the block list

181
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,460
okay so and then there was also a group

182
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,460
of domains like I said uh contributed by

183
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,400
companies and those were always included

184
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,319
but the problem with this was that there

185
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,139
were in fact a lot of domains that had

186
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,919
fewer than than uh virustotal detections

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,500
contributed by users those are all on

188
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,440
the left hand side in this plot

189
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
this means that a lot of the domains

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,220
that were contributed by users were

191
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,440
thrown out the window

192
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,919
and the group of volunteers that had to

193
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,020
evaluate them didn't scale with this

194
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,460
process

195
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,560
so what was the result

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,360
because they were relying on varistotle

197
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,580
and what was malicious

198
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,979
the output Blacklist included mostly

199
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,620
domains that were already known to be

200
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,620
malicious right so it's kind of a loop

201
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,060
you're creating

202
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,360
and as an effect the block list was kind

203
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,120
of downgraded to more generic fishing

204
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,699
so we found that the same list of

205
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,199
keywords that I told you about that were

206
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,800
related to covid-19 actually made up a

207
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,960
smaller share of domains on the list

208
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,080
than just the word WhatsApp

209
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,659
right which is indicative of generic

210
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,399
very generic phishing

211
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,640
and this means that although they were

212
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,279
able to improve performance for these

213
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,899
domains specifically they actually made

214
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,600
up a very small sliver of The Blacklist

215
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
okay we also found 75 false negatives

216
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,700
meaning domains that should have been on

217
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,100
the block list by these criteria but

218
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,580
actually weren't

219
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,240
what does it mean

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,300
we say yes

221
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,580
volunteers can aggregate timely threat

222
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,260
intelligence over existing

223
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,580
infrastructures

224
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,920
but in this case really it could have

225
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,839
been so much better that the coverage of

226
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,980
threats could have been so much better

227
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,260
had the community really capitalize on

228
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,120
those more than 4 000 volunteers

229
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,360
and what we hope is that when an

230
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,880
opportunity comes around for a similar

231
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,980
initiative like this that someone will

232
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,620
read our paper so please tell them in

233
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,860
case it happens because we discussed

234
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,839
extensively a few lessons that we have

235
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,700
learned

236
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,399
um the first is that all those tweets

237
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,779
asking people to join the community

238
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,760
maybe weren't so necessary because

239
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,920
scaling up the community doesn't

240
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,140
automatically lead to more or better

241
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,779
data being

242
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,920
propagated to the eventual block list

243
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,120
the second is Google save browsing

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,580
performed remarkably well even for this

245
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,680
new type of threat of covet related

246
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,099
abuse

247
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,019
and third

248
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,640
this openness is you know asking

249
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,399
everybody to join and to contribute it

250
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,860
really asked for a new type of quality

251
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,600
assurance process

252
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,399
like I said

253
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,440
um the process that was used using

254
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,120
varistotle was somewhat flawed but the

255
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,620
community had an Initiative for a

256
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,380
crowdsourcing bot in which domains that

257
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,240
were User submitted would be served to

258
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,760
other users who would then say yes it's

259
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,060
it's malicious or it's a false positive

260
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,060
this was very promising we were eager to

261
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,420
see if this had worked but unfortunately

262
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,880
it was only completed when the the bot I

263
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,860
mean the the crowdsourcing bot was only

264
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,260
completed when most of the user activity

265
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,779
had already tapered off so there weren't

266
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,120
really that many results to investigate

267
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,330
but it was very promising okay

268
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:56,940
[Music]

269
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,480
um

270
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,060
finally we looked only at the things we

271
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,980
could measure so we described the

272
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,320
community in the paper it had a lot of

273
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,540
user activities on the slack people were

274
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,160
talking to each other helping each other

275
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,779
and it could have been for example

276
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,760
takedowns as a result of that but we

277
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
investigated the block list and the

278
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
quality that that had so that's an

279
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,600
important limitation of our study

280
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
okay and with that I hope you take a

281
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
look at our paper if you're interested

282
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,260
in our work we had some nice methodology

283
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,260
that I didn't get around to explain

284
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,500
uh not enough time in these 12 minutes

285
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,540
but I'm eager to hear your questions
