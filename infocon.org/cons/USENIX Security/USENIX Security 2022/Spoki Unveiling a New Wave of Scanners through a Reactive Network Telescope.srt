1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
my name is Rafael and I will present our

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,120
paper spoky unveiling a new wave of

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,200
scanners through a reactive Network

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
telescope

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,260
um this is Joint work with my colleagues

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,240
Martin hello star Alberto and Professor

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,740
Smith and Valerie

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,480
I want to start with the observation

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,580
that the share of irregular TCP students

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,439
has been increasing over the last six to

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,359
seven years what we see here is data

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,099
collected in the UCSD Network telescope

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,619
which is a slash 9 ipv4 prefix what we

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,360
actually see is the share of TCP

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,760
students that have a TTL over 200. we

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,079
can see there are two shifts in this

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,300
graph once around 2014 there's a first

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,340
prize then later at the end of 2016

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,200
there's a much deeper rise until we see

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,960
75 percent of irregular sins in the

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,980
telescope

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,420
but what exactly is a student

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,860
irregularity

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,120
um there are three characteristics here

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,399
and they don't have to appear altogether

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,860
they can also come separately the first

28
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,079
one is the high TTL that we that already

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,020
saw on the first graph a TTL over 200 is

30
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,940
irregular because common operating

31
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,519
systems usually use much lower values

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,320
next is packets that don't have a TC

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,659
that don't carry any TCP options this is

34
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,640
similarly unlikely because operating

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,159
systems usually use options such as MSS

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,100
window size timestamp or S Arc in fact

37
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,479
lastly there are packets that have a

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,759
fixed IP ID of four five four three two

39
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,799
one which some of you might recognize

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,960
and all together we see a share of about

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,420
75 of irregular sins at the UCC Network

42
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,159
telescope which begs the question if

43
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,659
this phenomenon is specific to this

44
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,100
vantage point in the UCSD Network

45
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,540
telescope or if we can see this

46
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,560
elsewhere

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,079
we think this is a global phenomenon

48
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,939
first I want to look at the UCSD data

49
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,100
again we here see a graph that shows the

50
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,020
uh two lines one for packets with a high

51
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,180
TTL and one for those that don't have

52
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,280
TCP options in the UCSD Network

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
telescope in the months of April May and

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
June in 2020 and here you can see that

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,759
both lines are at around 75 percent and

56
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,259
they largely overlap

57
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,759
our next Advantage points are different

58
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,799
they actually carry flow data so this is

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,420
actually production production data and

60
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,340
different from a network telescope

61
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,860
the first one is an ixp in Europe and

62
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,540
why the lines are much more erratic here

63
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,038
we can still see that they often cross

64
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,500
75 and sometimes go even higher

65
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,360
and for our last vantage point we have

66
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,819
an ISP from Asia and here again we see

67
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,560
relatively stable lines around 75

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,780
percent so we think this is a global

69
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,819
phenomenon this is specific to network

70
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,340
telescopes which begs the question do

71
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,620
these packets pose a threat for that I

72
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,700
want to introduce some background on

73
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,440
stateless scanning stainless scanning

74
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,940
allows you to scan the internet in less

75
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,980
than one hour in commodity Hardware the

76
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,840
idea is to increase Gan speeds by

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,060
avoiding local state instead handcrafted

78
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,860
props are sent via raw sockets and

79
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,360
replies can be recognized based in

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,580
cookies this was first popularized by Z

81
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,560
map around 2013 and then later abused by

82
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,319
Mirai in 2016. if we come back to our

83
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,420
original graph we can see that the Rises

84
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,680
here coincide with this data around 2013

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,180
zmap kind of created the first rise and

86
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,220
then later Mirai correlates with the

87
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,220
second rise in this uh in irregular TCP

88
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,540
zones

89
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,400
so how can how can stateless scanning be

90
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,540
abused for that I want to talk about

91
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,700
two-phase scanning the idea of two-phase

92
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,959
scanning is that scanners scan in

93
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,879
multiple phases in the first phase they

94
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,379
come on the transport layer they send

95
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,000
these handcrafted irregular stateless

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,760
synths to identify responsive hosts

97
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,980
and then in the second phase they

98
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,080
connect again to these responsive hosts

99
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,459
on the application layer for this they

100
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,379
use the OS level TCP handshake and then

101
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,000
they can deliver payloads do more

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
reconnaissance and collect additional

103
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,120
information

104
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,159
we have the reactive Network telescope

105
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,900
called spoky to reveal these two phase

106
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,879
scanners spoken attacks with two phase

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,260
scanners in real time it's a scalable

108
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,060
system based on actors and build with

109
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,400
the c plus actor framework CAF using

110
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,780
slip trace for packet ingestion and

111
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,580
Scamper for probing the probes we send

112
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,500
out here out here are TCP cynics to

113
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,420
accept connections and TCP reset to

114
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,760
clean them up spoki also connects TCP

115
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,099
payloads after establishing connections

116
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,799
it is deployed in 224 prefixes one in

117
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,599
the US and one in the U and the code is

118
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,299
open source on GitHub

119
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,799
um to highlight the scalability a bit we

120
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,180
probably spoke it with about 1 million

121
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,379
probes per second

122
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,360
and what you see here on the x-axis is

123
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,159
the packet volume we send at spoken on

124
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,080
the y-axis you can see how many parallel

125
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,760
components we needed and the core

126
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,500
components ingestion the core logic and

127
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,299
logging all right require relatively few

128
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,799
components to handle this packet load

129
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,900
for probing we needed about 50 Scamper

130
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,820
instances however's camper has not been

131
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,738
optimized for the scenario so we think

132
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,600
this number can be brought down and

133
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,160
given enough resources spoki can also

134
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,560
schedule higher packet volumes

135
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,000
let's talk about the analysis the

136
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,919
analysis here is based on those two 24

137
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,259
prefixes in the data we collected there

138
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,820
first I want to talk about the share of

139
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,979
two-phase scanners we see two lines here

140
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,020
one for all scanners or all sources that

141
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,720
we saw that engaged in TCP scanning and

142
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,160
below in Orange the second line for

143
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,600
those that engaged in two-phase scanning

144
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,220
you can see that about across our

145
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,960
measurement period the shares about 30

146
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,720
percent even with like dips

147
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,220
in between

148
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,900
next I want to highlight the most

149
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,460
targeted Parts by two phase scanners

150
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,280
these are the top 20 Parts one blue one

151
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,740
bar for the U and one bar for the US

152
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,720
everybody can see that the most skin

153
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,580
part is Port 23 which is the part that

154
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,620
was scanned by Mirai the companion part

155
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,020
2323 can be seen on the left

156
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,699
there are two parts that stand out here

157
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,560
but one four three three and seven five

158
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
four seven because these are nearly

159
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,940
exclusively seen in the EU the first

160
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,100
part is used by for the TDS protocol by

161
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,680
Microsoft SQL and likely relates to bug

162
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,300
in the simatech

163
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,220
um application of the German Siemens are

164
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,880
game

165
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,340
and the second one is used by tr069

166
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,919
which concerns home routers

167
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,900
next I want to talk about TCP payloads a

168
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,780
bit TCP payloads are kind of a feature

169
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,919
of spooky because in traditional

170
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,479
telescopes CCP payloads are not

171
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,400
available

172
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,720
um we also scan the payloads that we

173
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,039
collect for downloaders this would be

174
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,160
shell codes such as wget or curl to

175
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,900
download further malware

176
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,419
across our whole data set we saw that

177
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,340
about 60 in the U and eight percent in

178
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
the US were ascially decodable so plain

179
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,220
text payloads

180
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,880
about 30 and 13 were binary payloads

181
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,160
that we saved as hacks

182
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,440
encoded strings and lastly we can see

183
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,940
that about one percent in the U and six

184
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,680
percent in us can obtain these

185
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,820
downloaders

186
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,440
the sample names and types of the

187
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,539
malware will be downloaded here A match

188
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,860
is known malware such as the MOSI

189
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,240
peer2p.net

190
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
we also compared these samples to virus

191
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
total we found that spoki detected 50 of

192
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,539
the spell the samples earlier than virus

193
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,600
total 26 would be nine so even after a

194
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,340
longer period of time they still did not

195
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,259
show up in virus total and the remainder

196
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,240
59 we consider this all because they

197
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,740
were already known when spooki first

198
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,660
encountered them

199
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,880
while my redistribution clearly points a

200
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,740
malicious intent we wanted to frequent

201
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,300
validate our findings and kind of extend

202
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,340
them to the larger data set the first

203
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,080
approach we did a semi menu and Analysis

204
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,180
here we classified the payloads based on

205
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,680
common characteristics and kind of

206
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
looked through the manual leap we found

207
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
more attacks we already saw Port 1433

208
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,220
and 7547 and the most commonly scanned

209
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,199
ports but there are other others such as

210
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,400
an attack of um on ADB via 0.555 that

211
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,680
installs crypto miners there are attacks

212
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,720
on a better devices that kind of hijack

213
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,100
them and gain control there's a real

214
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,740
Attack European exploit and more

215
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,840
so the second approach we went to a

216
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,280
threatened threat intelligence provider

217
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,319
gray noise and kind of collected

218
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,819
information about the source addresses

219
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,220
real noise classifies IPS into the

220
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,020
categories malicious benign and unknown

221
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,000
and if we look at our whole data set we

222
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,860
can see that about 30 to 40 percent of

223
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,120
the sources that send us two phase

224
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,819
events that send us any events are

225
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,620
malicious however if we only look at the

226
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,000
two-phase events we can see that about

227
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
60 to 70 percent of these events come

228
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,419
from malicious sources so there's a

229
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,400
concentration here on two-phase scanning

230
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,220
a month amongst malicious sources

231
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,380
for the last two starts I want to talk

232
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,419
about uh locality the first one is

233
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,940
geographical scanning locality scanners

234
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,500
focus on different parts in Europe and

235
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,300
us different vendors and different

236
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,620
deployments likely attract different

237
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,120
attacks based on the vulnerabilities

238
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,639
they have we already saw that the GDs

239
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,819
payload on 1.1433 is scanned in view

240
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,220
much more similarly SMB mini negotiation

241
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,900
messages both highlighted in blue are

242
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,819
also seen in the U really exclusively

243
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,500
there are others that are seen more in

244
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,599
the US such as TLS client hello messages

245
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,300
or the ADB attack that we saw

246
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,099
but even for the like lower volume

247
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,479
payloads we can see that they still have

248
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,400
a slight tendency to focus on run region

249
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,520
in these cases for example the US

250
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,440
but your graphical standing locality is

251
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,419
not the only locality we observe we also

252
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,580
saw topological scanning locality

253
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,620
six of the top 10 Source prefixes in the

254
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,539
EU these would be the sources of the

255
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,599
scanners shares 16 prefix with our 24

256
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,520
vantage point so they probably have a

257
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
more specific

258
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,200
prefix inside of this 16 prefix the

259
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,760
scanning behavior is associated with

260
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,559
botnets and we could not observe a

261
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,380
similar locality in the US or in our U.S

262
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,360
data set however we cross-check this

263
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,339
observation with the European ixp

264
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,020
traffic and here we found that local

265
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,240
irregular synths can be seen in 370

266
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,820
prefixes with about 150 packets per host

267
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,580
and these packets are very focused 69 of

268
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,380
them focus on only three parts which are

269
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,260
23 75 for seven and eight two nine one

270
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,240
and we check these sauces and could see

271
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,560
that these sources are actually

272
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,180
Microtech routers that were hijacked in

273
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,440
multiple cases

274
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,060
so likely.net

275
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,160
and we also checked this at the Asian

276
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,480
ISP and here we couldn't see any

277
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,120
correlation either

278
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,760
so for our takeaways um we built spoki

279
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
reactive Network telescope that makes

280
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,880
two-phase scanners visible and collects

281
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,500
their payloads we found that irregular

282
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,820
since dominates since on the internet

283
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,160
with a share of roughly 75 percent

284
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,019
we also found that two-way scanners act

285
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,940
as a catalyst so make sure that you use

286
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,800
short update Cycles in your systems to

287
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,660
keep up with their first pace

288
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,100
two-phase scanners are used for

289
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,540
malicious activity they deliver a

290
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,220
variety of malware and botnets use them

291
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,800
to attack systems

292
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,180
two-phase scanners follow the locality

293
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,279
patterns so if you use your data set to

294
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,300
learn something about your deployment

295
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,860
you should make sure that your data set

296
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,360
fits your deployment in the right

297
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,620
locality

298
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,000
but lastly two phase scanners have

299
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
detectable signatures this is good for

300
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,180
us because they can be tracked and their

301
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,459
packets can be filtered

302
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,060
thank you
