00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,600
as the title presence we address PHP

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,699
object injection pure vulnerability

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,580
which is also known as the insecurity

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,780
serialization according to the owasp top

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,079
10 insecure digitalization is one of the

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,600
most critical security threats in level

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,899
Publications I will explain this bug in

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,540
more detail

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,800
serialization is the process of

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
converting an object into stream of

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,579
bytes to store or transmit the object

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,879
PHP also supports realization for

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,640
example serialized function can convert

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,340
the full class object into the string

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,099
print representation

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,740
the serialization is the reverse process

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,700
in PHP on generalized function restores

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,340
the zeroid string to the original pH

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,280
value for Quest object

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,580
however if Insurance function takes in

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,700
user input an arbitrary object can be

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,759
injected into the application scope

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,460
so change secure digitalization is

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,340
called a PHP object injection block now

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,119
I'll explain how to exploit this bug

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,820
here is your PHP program with a pure

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,040
evolved in 914

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,820
suppose that an optical set the data

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,460
cookie is the serialized string

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,220
then on serialized function converts the

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,979
string into the object which is your

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,619
local object with blue type and low

38
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,860
properties and loop property is a 10 bar

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,100
object 0 f name property

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,380
then what happens

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,780
when terminating the program the

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,660
digitalized global object the data is

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,940
destroyed by inbooking its distract

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,200
method

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,680
then the following code is excluded

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,500
depending on the property values

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,140
finally the temperature closed method

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,080
could only function which can do it on

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,480
arbitrary file the Toyota classification

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,599
using the F9 property

51
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,060
now to sum up the article construction

52
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,520
object by Capital interesting its

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,980
improved values then those digitalized

54
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,560
those can invoke a chain of functions

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,319
that finally triggers a sync function

56
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,360
using this technique pure

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,340
vulnerabilities although different way

58
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,640
of text depending on the sync function

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,760
in this talk I record the object as an

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,980
exploit object each function natural

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,860
Gadget and obtainable functions as your

62
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,420
budgeting

63
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,000
the point is that the printing server

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,120
pure evolved poses a Potential Threat we

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,819
cannot confirm its exploitability

66
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,280
however the presence of explorable

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,080
because the chain that involves the sync

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,140
function can be a critical threat

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,560
existing scanners such as Bob or

70
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,720
kinetics and nips are identify only

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,000
qualified statisticalize the user input

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,659
but it cannot verify its explorably and

73
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,120
manually writing identifying causal

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,099
change requires a significant human

75
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,200
importance

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,860
and she's supporting Johannes does this

77
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,680
problem by not only detecting priority

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,459
vulnerabilities but also identifying

79
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,080
promising culture change using static

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,519
analysis

81
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,940
however this approaches still requires

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,220
manually generating spread objects for

83
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,319
those other chain to verify its

84
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,519
explorability

85
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,400
it is because this approach can identify

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,440
First positive change due to the

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,500
limitations of static analysis

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,319
unfortunately as the number of promising

89
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,019
change increases it becomes a hard task

90
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,840
to verify its chain and generate exports

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,160
for example control CMS had at least 26k

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,798
chains so it is improbable to manually

93
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,460
check these chains and generate exploits

94
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,880
in this paper we propose video on

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,160
automatic spray generation approach for

96
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,979
finding POI vulnerabilities identifying

97
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,919
other change and generating exploits

98
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,139
unlike the previous work future

99
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,780
automatically generates employees so you

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,300
can verify the explorability of a pure

101
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,660
vulnerability without false positives

102
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,300
on however it is challenging to generate

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,220
electronic support objects with multiple

104
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,620
property values that admire the

105
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,199
execution of a project chain I will show

106
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
some examples

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,520
constructed the district's next college

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,880
is 10 fires closed method then the robot

109
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
type property should be 10 string to

110
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,040
pass this condition and The Rook

111
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,380
property should be a temperature class

112
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,600
object to invoke 10 fires called the

113
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,680
method

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,979
it means when organic contains multiple

115
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,020
conditions to invoke the next Gadget

116
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,660
future should probably set the property

117
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,300
values to test the conditions

118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,880
also future should provide an optic

119
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,840
payload of the internet connection

120
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,180
parameter with zinc function using

121
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,880
property values in this program the

122
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,220
opening property should be a fireplace

123
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,020
to do it

124
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,479
to address this challenge we choose

125
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,520
feedback Drive important for generating

126
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,259
Sports

127
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,860
now I will explain how Future Works

128
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,100
given a Target application urine the POI

129
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,340
detector finds purely vulnerabilities

130
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,919
first the detector Force PHP building

131
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,560

134
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,740
including the predefined input stream

135
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,600
the serialize our special class

136
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,520
detects this three-point string and the

137
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,680
string is converted into a special class

138
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,100
object it depers the pointage of poi

139
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,840

140
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,300
given up your vulnerability and the

141
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,460
target application source code the

142

after excluding the program with the

175
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,960
material seed the water analyze its

176
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,759
execution returns such as Branch

177
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
coverage the death server causing Niche

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,020
and so on

179
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,479
if the mutated series contributes to

180
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,000
including coverage the fortunate's

181

184
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,319
progress it has a high probability to

185
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,759
select

186
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,220
the opposing process is repeated until

187
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,979
finding assist the discuss the targeting

188
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,680
function neuronautic payroll then future

189
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,660
refers to seed as an exploit object

190
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,879
let's move on to the evaluation

191
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,240
first we evaluated video on 30 PHP

192
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,120
Publications and applications are from

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,419
Celsius paper and the others are from

194
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,059
thbgc2 for each application private

195
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,039
version campaigner conducted in each

196
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,740
foreign campaign lasted 12 hours

197
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,040
for each country 14 is conducted for

198
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,860
almost 100 seconds

199
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,019
the table shows the result

200
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,200
for 30 applications future identified

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,080
about 10 million chains and conducted

202
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,480
version for 200 000 change

203
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,480
verified that future processes no first

204
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
positives

205
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,680
next We compare the performance of video

206
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,440
to the performance of CCS paper

207
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
since this paper to approach a virtually

208
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,540
causes change the ability to better

209
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,480
future can generate exposure culture

210
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,880
change diseases people reported

211
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,100
Target applications are the same as

212
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,700
those diseases paper used for evaluation

213
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,080
unfortunate setup is the same as the

214
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,700
vapor evaluation

215
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,040
the table shows the result

216
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,140
since the scissors paper does not

217
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,480
provide the details of its chain we

218
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,399
could only Compare the numbers reported

219
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,440
in such as paper

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,019
future generated exploit objects for

221
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,940
authoritical change from six

222
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,339
applications and this is a paper

223
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,120
identified 27 Square robocation from the

224
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,500
same applications

225
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,260
it demonstrates the future objectives

226
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,839
comparable performance to CCS even

227
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,180
though future generates exploit objects

228
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,860
unlike this is the people they

229
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,380
identified cutter chains

230
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,140
for the missing change from Contour Pig

231
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,019
in German future identify this change

232
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,420
because not generally exploit object due

233
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,760
to the limitations of watching we

234
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,620
believe that more advances deposing

235
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,959
optimization and computation resources

236
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,820
will decrease the number of First

237
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,800
negatives

238
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,920
future oversized several limitations

239
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,779
first future only assemblers got

240
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,839
extracted from the target application so

241
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,180
it can generate export using PHP

242
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,300
internal Rodgers or PHP binary modules

243
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,600
future videos are able to cover

244
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,519
effective course your target quality is

245
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,260
statically and desirable

246
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,079
when considering our existing causes for

247
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,240
this target holy research in a

248
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,459
prohibitive number of chains to conduct

249
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,380
positive testing

250
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,620
in conclusion we proposed visual double

251
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,440
stage to prepare vulnerabilities we

252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,480
operate a series of static analysis

253
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Dynamic analysis importing techniques to

254
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,160
compute causal change and genetic

255
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,579
exploits visual reported 68 exploit

256
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,220
objects from 30 year or the future

257
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,519
Publications with the first positives

258
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,380
video also reported two previously

259
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,600
unknown pure vulnerabilities with

260
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
functional exploring objects

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
