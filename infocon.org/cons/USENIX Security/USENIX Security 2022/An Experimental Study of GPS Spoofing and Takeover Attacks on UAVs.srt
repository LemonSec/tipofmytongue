1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
thank you for the introduction I'll

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,660
straight away get to the topic uh as you

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,180
know uavs are unmanned aerial vehicles

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,220
are everywhere there's an increasing

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,859
demand in civilian military as well as

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,800
commercial applications these vehicles

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,480
are inexpensive

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,180
um capable of autonomous and sensor

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,239
driven applications and with this modern

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,360
uavs pose a serious security threat as

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,100
you know there have been incidences

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,860
where these commercial uavs and consumer

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,320
uavs have

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,480
prevented flight from taking off and

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,460
have caused major airport shutdowns

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,820
there have been also incidences of

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,539
drones attacking oil facilities and one

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,699
thing common to all these drones is that

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,120
they rely heavily on GPS so GPS or

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,579
global positioning system provides

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,500
positioning navigation and timing

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,260
information they rely on wireless

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,020
signals from orbiting satellites and a

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,180
major factor about these signals is that

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,920
they lack any form of authentication

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,020
which makes it extremely vulnerable to

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,760
spoofing attacks

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,460
uh in a spoofing attack an attacker

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,640
transmits a fabricated signals and

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,979
forces the receiver to calculate a wrong

32
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,060
location

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,520
in past researchers have demonstrated

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,580
attacks on GPS receivers private work

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,680
has also shown the ability to disrupt or

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,320
alter the motion of unmanned Vehicles

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,240
there are limited studies on the

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,100
visibility but

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,920
no previous work has examined and field

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,860
tested a control takeover of uavs in a

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,439
real environment outside of a simulator

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
and with this there are some research

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,799
questions that haven't been answered yet

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,560
one is Canon entity adversarial or

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,680
active defense precisely control a uav's

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,540
movement by spoofing appropriate GPS

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,820
signals and if so uh what are the

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,619
requirements and fundamental limitations

49
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,860
of such spoofing strategies

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,899
so with this in mind

51
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,020
we perform an exhaustive experimental

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,440
analysis on the behavior of consumer

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,140
uavs under a GPS proofing attack in this

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,780
process we enumerate several challenges

55
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,620
and in accomplishing such takeovers we

56
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,660
also show that it's to some extent it's

57
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,879
possible to control the speed and

58
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,300
direction of uavs through GPS proofing

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,239
and finally we Implement a real-time

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,879
signal generator that can make arbitrary

61
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,459
changes to the spoof trajectory which

62
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,260
allows us to introduce a human in the

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,360
loop GPS spoofer through which we can

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
manually execute patterns like 180

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,420
degree returns

66
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,640
so before we move on to uh the actual

67
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
experimental evaluation let's take a

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,760
look at the flight controller

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,980
architecture

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,019
so the flight controller has multiple

71
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,360
tightly coupled components uh like

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
variety of sensors a Sensor Fusion

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,760
algorithm PID controllers and actuators

74
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,819
the UAV uses all these components in

75
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,739
tight coordination to maintain the

76
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,840
required orientation position and

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
velocity

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
there are predominantly two flight modes

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,140
where One manual mode where GPS is not

80
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,239
actively used for navigation however

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,340
there is another mode which is the

82
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,860
autonomous mode where the UAV heavily

83
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,959
relies on GPS

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,780
Now GPS plays a crucial role in this

85
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,940
tightly coupled architecture and

86
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,159
spoofing attacks on GPS affect the

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,379
entire processing chain and given the

88
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,140
tightly coupling of various subsystems

89
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,840
including inside of flight controller we

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,580
need specialized environment for

91
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,400
thorough analysis of these attacks

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,739
so we essentially need an environment

93
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,080
where we can wirelessly transmit

94
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,080
spoofing signals and also we need

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,180
capability to monitor the drone's

96
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,980
movement with high precision

97
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,040
so for this we make use of a anechoic

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,959
chamber which is large enough to fly

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,500
drones and it prevents us from running

100
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,659
into legal issues of transmitting GPS

101
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,700
signals wirelessly

102
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,720
next this chamber is also equipped with

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
opti-track motion capture cameras which

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,720
can track drones with high precision

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,240
we also have GPS transmission equipment

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,199
which consists of an uh

107
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,479
of an omnidirectional antenna software

108
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,660
defined radios and power amplifiers

109
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,940
and finally we test all our attacks

110
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,820
using uh consumer uavs from leading

111
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,099
manufacturers like Auto and DJI

112
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,060
so we start off with some preliminary

113
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,400
experiments uh and I'll present some key

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,780
insights you can always refer to the

115
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,020
paper for more details so first we start

116
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,540
off by spoofing a static location where

117
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,699
we set the Drone to hover and we spoof

118
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,280
the exact same location and as a result

119
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,060
because of in uh inertial drift the

120
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,180
drift in inertial sensors and the biases

121
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,000
the Drone starts moving randomly

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,960
next we introduce a motion or a dynamic

123
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,419
motion to the spoofed location and as

124
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,380
you can see the UAV motion is shifted by

125
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,080
180 180 degrees that is if I start

126
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,600
scooping in direction of B the motion

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,840
the UAV starts moving in Direction C

128
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,479
so here uh the spoof we learned at the

129
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,699
spoof GPS velocity uh induces

130
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,460
acceleration in the UAV as the PID

131
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,780
controller uh responds by

132
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,860
compensating for the difference in the

133
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,020
Target position which is the original

134
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,060
location where it is and the actual

135
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,620
position

136
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,080
next we also learned that over time

137
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
these Corrections get more aggressive

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
and the UAV will continue accelerating

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,800
in the initially spoof Direction this

140
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,740
means that uh in such spoofing the

141
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,600
attacker has no control over the speed

142
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,320
or the direction so the UAV will just

143
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,080
keep on accelerating and will eventually

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
stop when either it runs out of battery

145
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,240
or it just crashes because of loss of

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,259
thrust

147
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,660
so from here we conclude that for

148
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,759
complete takeover an attacker should be

149
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,280
able to control the UAV speed the

150
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,259
direction and finally it should also be

151
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,840
able to land the UAV

152
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,660
so let's take a look at our strategy to

153
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,280
control the velocity

154
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,160
so we know that the UAV reacts to GPS

155
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,680
spoofing by accelerating in the opposite

156
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,539
direction and the lack of control over

157
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,400
velocity is because the flight

158
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,380
controller thinks that the correction is

159
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,840
not working so over time the corrections

160
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,340
become more aggressive

161
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,620
so to control the acceleration we can

162
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,360
trick the flight controller into

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
believing that

164
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,580
the correction is working so

165
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,940
if the actual location is coming closer

166
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,259
to Target location

167
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,319
the corrections will meow down and this

168
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
can be achieved through a return to

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
launch maneuver

170
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,560
so here as you can see that we start

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,800
spoofing and the Drone reacts by

172
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,120
accelerating

173
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,240
so here we Define this reaction time

174
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,340
which is the time it takes to accelerate

175
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,039
and Achieve Target velocity

176
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,400
so this reaction time can be observed by

177
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,220
a strategic and controlled spoofing in

178
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,620
small increments or it can also be

179
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,500
calculated and estimated uh using drones

180
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,940
physical characteristics and

181
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,759
capabilities like its weight the thrust

182
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,020
uh

183
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,479
and the motor specifications

184
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,240
so as you can see the Drone keeps

185
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,599
accelerating and when we reverse the

186
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,660
direction of the dynamic spoof motion

187
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,060
you can see that the Drone starts de

188
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,759
accelerating that is because when the

189
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,039
spoof motion is reversed the difference

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,639
between the Target and actual position

191
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
starts decreasing

192
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
however when we

193
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,940
reverse it again you can see that the de

194
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,580
acceleration is slowed down and hence we

195
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,919
conclude that periodic reversal of the

196
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,979
spoofed Motions uh Direction can be used

197
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,919
for velocity control

198
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,800
so to further evaluate the velocity

199
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,379
control strategy we perform 48

200
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,240
experimental flights

201
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,180
and we set the speed limit of 0.5 meters

202
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,520
per second and the objective of

203
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,740
maintaining average acceleration of 0

204
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,620
meters per second squared

205
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,059
the average acceleration needs to be

206
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,059
maintained close to zero because if the

207
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,360
drones acceleration is uh about zero

208
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,360
then the velocity is constant so with

209
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,760
this uh we had Fair success rate about

210
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,240
81 flights ah where we maintain the

211
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,600
average velocity below the speed limit

212
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,640
and there are multiple factors that

213
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,860
affect this reaction time like sensor

214
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,580
drifts biases uh various manufacturing

215
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,040
defects and Etc they affect this time

216
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,500
sensitive strategy

217
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,800
so similarly Direction control is also

218
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,839
challenging uh simply changing the

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,000
direction of spoof motion is not

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,459
sufficient because the Drone already has

221
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,019
inertia it's in motion because of

222
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,700
dynamic spoofing and the flight

223
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,620
controller is already performing some

224
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,519
correction

225
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,459
so our strategy is to null the

226
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,040
corrections by the acceleration so as I

227
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,899
explained earlier we perform this de

228
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,820
acceleration routine and reduce the

229
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,040
uav's velocity to zero meters per second

230
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,459
once this is achieved we can introduce a

231
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,680
change in the direction of spoof motion

232
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,640
and execute this direction control

233
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,820
so as a proof of concept we have UAV

234
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,279
performing Sharp 90 degree turns for

235
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,740
example like here where the Drone turns

236
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,920
North

237
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,620
so at at times this Reaction Time

238
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,200
Strategy can fail and is not as accurate

239
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,140
so for this we introduce a human in the

240
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,660
loop GPS spoofer which enables a

241
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,120
feedback based on uav's restorections to

242
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,700
GPS proofing so here the attacker

243
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,820
observes the uav's motion and using a

244
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
human interface device manipulates the

245
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,300
trajectory

246
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,820
so a system like this provides a video

247
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
game like control uh to observe the

248
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,360
uav's motion and then react to it

249
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,640
so let's take a look at the video

250
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,040
demonstration of hitl in action

251
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,279
so it's important to note that all the

252
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,200
actions performed by the UAV Beyond this

253
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
point are are its own reactions to GPS

254
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,820
proofing and the attacker has no control

255
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,300
over it

256
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,880
foreign

257
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,220
controls uh the spoof signal using arrow

258
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,000
keys so we turn off the vision sensors

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,160
and the Drone instructor drone to fly

260
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,820
right by spoofing accordingly

261
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,800
as you can see it's slightly the

262
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,939
velocity increases

263
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,360
and eventually we force the Drone to

264
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,380
execute this 180 degree turn by again a

265
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,180
strategic spoofing in a particular

266
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,839
direction and as you can see the drawing

267
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,279
turns and starts moving in the opposite

268
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,640
way and finally when the Drone is close

269
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,579
to the walls we enable manual control

270
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,880
and land the UAV

271
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,640
so uh I'll again like to stress on the

272
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,680
fact that all the actions that the Drone

273
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,959
just performed were its own reactions to

274
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360
GPS spoofing and the attacker is not or

275
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,279
the operator is not controlling the UAV

276
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,079
in any way

277
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,839
so finally once the attacker establishes

278
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,600
direction and speed control uh what's

279
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,480
remaining is landing the UAV so for this

280
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,019
we leverage existing fail safes a

281
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,320
failsafe is triggered when uh the flight

282
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
controller detects any errors that

283
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,120
jeopardizes uav's safety

284
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
um and for this two typical fail safes

285
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,820
are no-fly zones and EK errors so ecaf

286
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,920
or extended Kalman filter errors occur

287
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,720
when there is some discrepancy between

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,480
uh inertial sensor measurements and GPS

289
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,399
measurements

290
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,880
so to conclude the final takeaways are

291
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,160
that all the uavs that we tested uh

292
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,839
still remain vulnerable to spoofing

293
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,260
attacks however precise takeover of uavs

294
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,240
through GPS proofing is not trivial

295
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,380
because once the UAV

296
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,620
experiences GPS spoofing it becomes a

297
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,839
very highly unstable system so we are

298
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,240
essentially controlling the chaos

299
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,839
and then the titl system that we design

300
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,120
is capable of manually controlling the

301
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
UAV

302
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,079
but it requires a lot of training good

303
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
hand-eye coordination the strategy is

304
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,959
demonstrated apart from hitl are based

305
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,839
on three observations of the uavs and

306
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,660
are subject to external factors

307
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,480
and finally uh we conclude that precise

308
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,940
and fine-grained control requires a

309
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,279
closed loop feedback mechanism where the

310
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,220
spoofer reacts to the uav's reactions to

311
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,440
GPS proofing so thank you
