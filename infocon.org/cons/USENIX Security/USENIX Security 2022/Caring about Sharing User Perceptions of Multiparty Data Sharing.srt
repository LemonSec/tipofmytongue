1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,920
okay good afternoon to everyone joining

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,960
us here in Boston and to those of you

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,360
online good morning or good evening or

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,800
whatever the appropriate temporal

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,420
greeting is for you

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,220
in this work with my colleagues at the

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,080
University of Waterloo

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
we focused on the way companies use or

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,539
share the data they collect from their

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,880
users and how it's continued to evolve

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,540
over time it's no longer limited to this

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,820
kind of classical scenario where one

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,399
organization provides data to another in

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,160
the interest of generating advertising

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,980
Revenue

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,600
variations include things like the

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
Google and MasterCard deal where they

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,520
try to determine an intersection see if

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,219
a digital ad resulted in a sale in a

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,800
physical store we also see more and more

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,480
tech companies getting involved with

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,719
health data this can come in the form of

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,640
health research or some sort of

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,500
collaboration with a hospital wanting to

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,540
work with their data

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,820
further we can see cases like a

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,880
subsidiary where the for example might

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,520
be a coffee company collecting so much

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,500
location data on their users that

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,140
someone who just wanted to schedule

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,939
to be able to pick up their coffee on

32
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,820
their way to work at a convenient time

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,979
ends up having where they live work or

34
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,900
even vacation being known to the parent

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,939
company

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,159
and the interesting thing or the not so

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,720
fortunate thing with all of these

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,400
different data Evolutions that have been

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,159
occurring is particularly in Canada and

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
the United States what we tend to see is

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
this information is provided to

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,040
individuals in the form of privacy

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,180
policies

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,400
and Within These privacy policies it

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,920
falls into these big buckets of third

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
parties or trusted partners and so what

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,899
we wanted to do with this work is focus

48
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,360
on trying to disambiguate these buckets

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
and to see if we presented the

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
individuals in our study with very

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,259
specific types of data sharing where

52
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,299
perhaps both individuals or both

53
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,880
organizations get data maybe only one or

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,679
many organizations provide data to

55
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,459
another

56
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,560
do these different types change the

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
acceptability of the data sharing

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,440
practices

59
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,599
and further if we looked at existing

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,580
user controls that we tend to look at in

61
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,220
literature like how consent is contain

62
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,739
how consent is attained what the purpose

63
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,420
of use is or how long the data is

64
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,379
retained

65
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,840
are there also variations Within These

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,580
controls based on the type of data

67
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,040
sharing occurring

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,599
and to find the answers to these

69
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,900
questions we use SurveyMonkey to recruit

70
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,360
over a thousand participants and we use

71
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,580
gender and age balancing and so this was

72
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,720
in March of 2021

73
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,560
now after we excluded all the

74
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,360
participants who responded to that the

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,760
shape of a red ball was blue we had a

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,459
nice number of over 900 to work with

77
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,560
each of the participants in our study

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,140
received one of 12 scenarios and a

79
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,760
series of questions corresponding to the

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,160
user controls we had identified ending

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,739
with a free form response question

82
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,120
with the exception of the freeform

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,319
response

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,800
all answers came on those Five Points

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,080
semantic differential scale ranging from

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,819
completely unacceptable through to

87
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,958
completely acceptable

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,420
now after looking through the news and

89
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,060
different kind of laws considerations

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,000
that had come across in Canada and the

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
United States we identified five types

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,959
of sharing that we wanted to focus on

93
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,180
now for those of you saying there are

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,840
six boxes up there you are correct

95
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,819
we did add an additional case where the

96
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,640
only varied variation for the validation

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,400
is we changed the order of the text to

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,799
make sure we could know in advance if

99
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,379
the in when we introduced the companies

100
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,480
say we said there's a tech company

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
involved or there's a health company

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,840
when we presented those descriptions we

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,400
wanted to see if the order influenced

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,959
the acceptability

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,459
now unfortunately when we did the

106
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,159
statistical test we found no indications

107
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,500
that it changed the acceptability which

108
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,540
meant we when we went into the remaining

109
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,060
types we could confidently not have to

110
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,799
continue considering that in our

111
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,139
analysis

112
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,540
we did include in our types a one-way

113
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,339
two-party exchange which kind of ties

114
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,860
back to that classical two-party

115
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,479
advertising situation where one

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,400
organization provides data to another

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,860
but we also have cases where both

118
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,900
entities receive data so a two-way

119
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,300
two-party exchange we have the kind of

120
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,340
data broker situation where multiple

121
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,380
organizations provide data to a single

122
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,139
organization and we have organizations

123
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,479
where there's a startup that got bought

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,580
out by a bigger company

125
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,259
and within each of the types we

126
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,040
identified we include two variations

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,020
with the main kind of system going

128
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,720
through it is that a tech company would

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,820
receive the data in the one case if it's

130
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,220
not a both situation and a health

131
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,060
company would receive it in the other

132
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,199
now

133
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,940
for the remainder of this talk I'm just

134
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,500
going to highlight some of my favorite

135
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,900
results or the results that we kind of

136
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,840
tie most into the takeaways of our

137
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,080
surveys if you want more I highly invite

138
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,000
you to look at our paper because we look

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,340
at the analysis across all 900

140
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,320
participants we look at comparing

141
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,520
between the different types we

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,900
identified and within them

143
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,280
starting off just nice and general with

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,580
some descriptive statistics now we show

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,979
the general acceptability when

146
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,720
participants weren't given any

147
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,699
additional information about the type of

148
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,000
sharing that was going on about 45 said

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,759
uh this is kind of not so great I'm

150
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,960
going to say it's either completely

151
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,940
unacceptable or just in general

152
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,639
unacceptable

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,220
but we do still see this cluster of 30

154
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,620
percent of that over 900 participants

155
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,020
who were like yeah I'm I'm okay with

156
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,880
this you can you can use my data in this

157
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,860
scenario I don't have further questions

158
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,380
my initial Vibe is this is fine

159
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,120
with them saying that it was either

160
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,039
somewhat acceptable or completely

161
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,500
acceptable

162
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,060
when we get into some of our user

163
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,979
controls we can now do some statistical

164
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,800
analysis and compare between them

165
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,259
now these are the labels that you'll see

166
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,539
in our results in our paper I promise

167
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,400
you we did not tell the participants

168
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,039
that consent was concealed but instead

169
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,479
what they would have seen is a

170
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,120
description that said a company that you

171
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,539
are a user of ended up using your data

172
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,419
in this situation you found out about it

173
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,840
by seeing a news article in in your

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,600
morning web search

175
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,759
and unsurprisingly this was

176
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,979
overwhelmingly negative

177
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,280
assumed consent is the case that is the

178
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,259
more honest version of a privacy policy

179
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,720
there was no real way for you to opt out

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
it was just shown to you in the privacy

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,319
policy which we all know you probably

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,180
didn't read

183
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,120
opt-out consent is well the default

184
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
cookie setting when you see those cookie

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,419
bars at the bottom you have to go

186
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,180
through this process and click and get

187
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,039
to the state where you no longer have to

188
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,160
participate in sharing your cookies

189
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,780
opt-in gold standard everyone thinks

190
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,039
it's the best

191
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,139
in our participant pool and probably

192
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,300
everyone in this room where you have to

193
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,180
explicitly choose to have your data used

194
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,160
in this setting

195
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,919
for all four of these consent cases that

196
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,720
we considered these were all

197
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
statistically significantly different

198
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
from one another

199
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,419
so when our participants are saying they

200
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,120
really like opt-in consent and like opt

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,479
out consent is okay that is a strong

202
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,520
difference and not something that kind

203
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,460
of suggests we can keep defaulting to an

204
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,340
opt out setting

205
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,860
I call this the fun or slightly

206
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,919
concerning by means a very concerning

207
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,780
result in the sense that when we talk

208
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,460
about data retention if I tell the

209
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,979
people in this room that a company is

210
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,319
going to continue to keep your data

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,419
while they are using it you likely

212
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,860
understand that that could be forever

213
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,139
they may never stop using it maybe they

214
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,520
used it to train a machine learning

215
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,139
model and it's going to exist in that

216
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,360
until that model is gone

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,759
however when presented to the

218
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,160
participants in our study they didn't

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,680
consider this to be similar to that

220
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,020
indefinitely setting in fact it was

221
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,940
statistically different than

222
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,060
indefinitely and lining up more with the

223
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,000
description of foray set time so while

224
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,159
the company is using it was viewed as

225
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,719
the same as like for our research

226
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,279
studies where we tell our participants

227
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,740
after some number of years will delete

228
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,520
this data when in reality that

229
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,980
is not more similar to well in use and

230
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,500
so this highlights how the granularity

231
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,140
of details really needs to be focused

232
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,180
when we're having regulations or policy

233
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,100
on how to present this information to

234
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,500
users or as a community or developers

235
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,480
what we're informing them because it's

236
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
very easy to have something that could

237
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,500
lead to a dark pattern that could

238
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,240
manipulate users into agreeing something

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,519
that perhaps they didn't actually mean

240
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,500
to

241
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,720
highlighting these sharing types I keep

242
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
talking about

243
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,140
we did find that there were statistical

244
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,959
differences between the types of data

245
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,300
and the one I'm highlighting here is we

246
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
have the acquisition scenario where some

247
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,160
company bought out another or the two

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,260
companies merged and then were acquired

249
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,959
by a third company being more acceptable

250
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,820
than these cases where one company is

251
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,560
providing data to another or multiple

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,540
companies are providing to data to

253
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,279
another

254
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,660
and when we look at this we can

255
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,019
hypothesize that despite the fact that a

256
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,240
merger or an acquisition could be for

257
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,860
the companies about the data they're

258
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,000
going to acquire from that other

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,060
organization when a individual is

260
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,920
looking at that in terms of their data

261
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,380
it's not seen so obviously as a sailor

262
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,839
being about having their data sent off

263
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,880
to someone else

264
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,560
and so it leans more towards this

265
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,680
positive decide even though it may or

266
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
may not be what they actually intended

267
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,760
but the key takeaway being

268
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,339
how the data is being provided has an

269
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,620
impact and if you want to see more about

270
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,720
this look in our paper because we also

271
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,760
see patterns of this when we talk about

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,760
those user controls I had like the way

273
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,820
consent was obtained and how long the

274
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,880
data is retained for and also purpose

275
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,500
which I've kind of skipped over because

276
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,899
well to be quite honest the results are

277
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,779
using data to improve Services is much

278
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,760
better pretty good using data to

279
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,580
generate Revenue not so great as we

280
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,800
might expect

281
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,140
so to wrap things up for you the

282
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,060
granularity of information that is

283
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,220
conveyed to individuals whether it be a

284
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,740
privacy policies or otherwise

285
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,260
isn't sufficient in current systems to

286
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,420
provide the information users need to

287
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,519
make an informed decision as to what

288
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,339
their preferences actually are and so

289
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,320
given the results of this paper we're

290
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,120
saying you need to disambiguate these

291
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,740
third parties

292
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,899
and make explicit who's receiving data

293
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,600
whether it's multiple organizations and

294
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,300
who these organizations are and finally

295
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
the ongoing theme that came out through

296
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,100
some of the stats I talked about today

297
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,560
but also in our free Farm responses is

298
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,720
the importance of acquiring explicit

299
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,079
versus this implicit consent

300
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,300
and so thank you and I would be happy to

301
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,959
take your questions
