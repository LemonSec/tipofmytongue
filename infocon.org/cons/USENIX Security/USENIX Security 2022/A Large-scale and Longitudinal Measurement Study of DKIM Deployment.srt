00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,280
hello everyone I'm chuhan Wang from

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,860
qinghua University today I will talk

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,079
about our research on email

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,380
Authentication Protocol Decay the title

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,240
is a large scale and longitude no

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,380
management study of DCM deployment

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,840
email service is one of the popular

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,180
services in the internet world

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,520
and it is because of its important

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,480
position

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,000
that email service has also become an

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
important Target for attackers

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,379
the defined against the emails proving

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,079
attacks various email authentication

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,719
protocols have been proposed under

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,000
standardized during this year

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,940
at present the Kim is one of the most

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,980
widely used email authentication

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,260
protocols

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,199
the game has been proposed to

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,559
understandalized since 2008 and is now

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,140
adopted by Yahoo Google and other

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,320
leading email service providers

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,200
the game signature is generated based on

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,380
HG algorithm and asymmetric encryption

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,619
algorithm just like RSA

27
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,439
the game's public key is deployed on a

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,259
domain name in The Following format just

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,680
like that the selector here is a random

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,140
string specified by the domain owner and

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,700
example.com

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,280
represents a real domain name

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,939
the image here is an example of a real

34
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,960
decaying signature

35
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,720
next let's talk take a look at the

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,759
workflow of the game

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,520
first the sender deploys the Decay

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,860
protocol they need to generate a key

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,500
Pair by asymmetric encryption algorithm

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,860
and then deployed the camera course

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,700
meaning the decaying public key on a DI

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,479
server of a specified domain second

43
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,258
window senders MTA sends an email it

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,480
became signature is calculated for the

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
outgoing email which includes the email

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,560
headers the email body and the became

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,599
signature itself

48
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,500
last when receivers MTA receives an

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,680
email with articum signature it also

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,200
first exercise the the camera course for

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,260
the sender's domain to validate the the

52
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,239
game signature

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,700
although tkm is an important email

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,980
security protocol and it has been

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,440
proposed for more than 10 years video

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,959
has been done to understand the adoption

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,480
rate and the potential security issues

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,980
of the claim

59
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,040
in the previous Works they conduct life

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
skill measurements of the other two

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,300
protocol

62
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,379
SPF and the mark but Kim was absent

63
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,720
this is because the future of the game

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,940
makes it difficult to be measured at

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,959
scale

66
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,019
from the previous description we are

67
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,879
able to know that there are two main

68
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,480
ways to obtain the game information once

69
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,180
from the team records and the other is

70
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,760
from the game signatures

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,040
the camera course

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,860
is deployed

73
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,140
in this specified mean

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,900
because the selector is randomly

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,599
specified it's difficult to measure and

76
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
scale directly

77
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,459
designs became signature also difficult

78
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,860
to client by researchers the game

79
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,680
signatures are in binded in the email

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,260
header and would not be publicly

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,900
released

82
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,360
it's difficult for researchers to obtain

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,400
large amounts of the game signatures

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,299
data for further security analysis

85
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,120
however we find two ways to guide this

86
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,799
game information

87
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,159
first we can pass the camera course from

88
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,959
passive dance data size

89
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,780
and the second we can extract the game

90
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,180
signatures from email headers

91
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,120
therefore we collaborate with our

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
industrial partners and get the data

93
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,358
science

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,660
in total our data covers five million

95
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,540
distinct domains and two million these

96
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,020
instructors

97
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,759
our data collection and Analysis process

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,780
is shown in the future figure below

99
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,440
which is mainly divided into three parts

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,940
including data collection data

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,759
processing and data analysis the data

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,100
collection stage has been basically

103
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,520
tasked talked earlier meaning through

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,340
cooperation with industrial Partners to

105
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,560
obtain the corresponding the camera

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,860
course and the decimal signatures

107
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,680
after data collection we will perform a

108
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,860
series of operations such as data

109
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,040
cleaning data aggregation and the

110
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,919
dumplication on the raw data

111
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,020
through the above passive collection

112
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,460
stage

113
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,220
we found that there are many commonly

114
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,600
used selectors such as mail default

115
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,620
Decay which will be used by many domains

116
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,300
therefore we conduct a large scale

117
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,280
measurement of I like talk one meaning

118
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,039
domains it was the top 40 sectors

119
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,100
obtained from the passive collection

120
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,680
and finally we can use the results of

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,259
the measurement to analyze Decay

122
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,520
adoption rate

123
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,759
the grammatical problems of the camera

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,940
course became key management issues and

125
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,759
it became signature issues

126
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
in this paper we perform a large scale

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,560
and longitudinal management study on the

128
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,500
current state of the Kim the results

129
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,639
shows that 28 percent of elect top 1

130
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,620
million domains have enabled the claim

131
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,300
of which three percent are misconfigured

132
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,520
besides we also measure the adoption

133
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,340
rate of SPF and the DeMark by active

134
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,960
scanning

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,919
and the results can reflect the current

136
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,259
status of the game deployment from the

137
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:19,979
side

138
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,100
the image here shows the change in

139
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,340
deployment rules of SPF Decay and Mark

140
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,759
over the past few years part of the data

141
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,240
comes from the two paper list below

142
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,280
to know more about the game deployment

143
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,940
we also analyze the game adoption of the

144
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,280
domains under different country code top

145
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,580
level domains and genetical top level

146
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,020
domains

147
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,120
next let's talk about game key

148
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,000
management issues

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,220
RFC recommends that the game Keys should

150
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,580
be rotated on a routine basis

151
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,100
however we found using long lifetime

152
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,740
Keys is common even for most high

153
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,360
profiled means

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,639
the below figure shows the number of

155
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,360
long lifetime keys of LX top 100 domains

156
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,020
covered by our data site the orange part

157
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,720
represents the numbers of keys that have

158
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,440
not been rotated in the last five years

159
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,680
finally we found it out of Alex top 20

160
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,919
domains have not rotated their keys in

161
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,900
the past 12 years

162
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,080
we also analyzed the game key lines in

163
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,479
passive against their site

164
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,220
RFC has pointed out the short I say keys

165
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,280
more easily succumbed to offline attacks

166
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,580
and designers should use IC keys of at

167
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,400
least 2048 bits

168
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,120
the NST has also recommended that

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,380
however our research shows 84 percent of

170
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,319
more than 3 million domains still use

171
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
the keys that are less or equal to

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,160
1024 bits well more than

173
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,620
five thousand domains still use sticking

174
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,039
keys that are even like them

175
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,900
512 bits

176
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,240
we also analyze issues of the game's

177
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,599
signatures in practice based on 400

178
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,940
million real decaying signatures from

179
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,259
Camille

180
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,539
we find most domains have become

181
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,180
signature issues for example

182
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,539
Rick decam signatures are common

183
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,599
what is rate became signature the game

184
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
signatures should sign important email

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,700
headers to protect the content Integrity

186
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,640
of email and avoid being

187
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,700
abused for replay attacks

188
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,880
however IFC only specified the from

189
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,220
field to be must assigned

190
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,820
although it also recommend the other 20

191
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,220
headers should be signed in the game

192
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,279
signatures we find no domain in our

193
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,140
designs signing all of the 20 headers

194
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,440
RC only provide a basic guideline that

195
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
dkm signatures need to protect the core

196
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,800
content of the email message

197
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
actually we found that the Hydra Fields

198
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,380
signing in the decam signatures vary

199
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,100
among different email services

200
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,160
this there is not a consensus in the

201
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,459
actual implementation almost all of the

202
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,480
domains have signed from and subtract

203
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,300
Fields however only 11 percent of

204
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,699
domains have signed replying two fields

205
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,240
to prevent

206
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,899
adding duplicate Hider field

207
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,540
the game the designers proposed a method

208
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,240
of oversigning which means a Hider name

209
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,060
should appear in space tags once more

210
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,459
than the actual numbers of that header

211
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,500
in an email

212
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,839
there is an example of over signing

213
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:01,920
mechanism

214
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
all setting mechanism is helpful to

215
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,080
protect users from the emails grouping

216
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,060
or text

217
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,500
however we measured how many domains use

218
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,240
ourseling to protect themselves against

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,700
multiple headers attack

220
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,080
were found only 2.2 percent of domains

221
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,899
in our decaying signatures data side use

222
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,899
our signing mechanism

223
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,180
the last part is about mitigation and

224
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,180
recommendation

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
first we have tried our biased to report

226
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,480
all on vulnerabilities we found into the

227
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,360
relevant email administrators

228
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,860
for email vendors and 24 relevant email

229
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,660
administrators have acknowledged our

230
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,980
report

231
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,440
and second we have developed developed

232
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,519
an online tool for decline development

233
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,920
based on our measurement and Analysis

234
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,279
scripts this tool can have email

235
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,660
administrators check and deploy their

236
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,120
dick in records and further improve the

237
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,540
status of the game deployment now this

238
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,240
tool can be excised

239
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,959
at notesproofing.cn

240
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,459
at last we proposed to

241
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,959
improvements which may have to improve

242
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,720
the protective effect of decam

243
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,579
signatures and prevent decline

244
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,339
signatures from being used for replay

245
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,040
attacks if you are you interested in our

246
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,760
work please read our paper for details

247
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,220
I'm sorry that I can't attend a meeting

248
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,519
in person because of the kovid 19.

249
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,160
please feel free to ask any questions on

250
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,140
this like and I will respond in time

251
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,519
that's all thank you
