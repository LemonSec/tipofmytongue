1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,380
thank you okay thanks very much for the

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,559
introduction so now I will present it's

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,839
going to work with Mohammad Andrew Rahul

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,680
and Airlines on Trigger action platforms

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,320
so to this intended users are using a

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
large number of services to manage their

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,939
Digital Data or cyber physical iot

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,140
devices

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,900
but working out working across different

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,000
Services still remain a very challenging

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,820
task as the services are built with apis

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,880
that don't understand each other

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,700
Trigger action platforms like aves and

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,160
zapier is a new kind of online system

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,219
that aim to solve this problem the

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,739
purpose of a Trigger action platform or

17
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,100
tab is to become a centralized Hub that

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,219
connects to many other services

19
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,079
specifically tabs in power automation

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,719
Rules by categorizing Services into

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,199
triggers and actions so that the users

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,600
can connect one trigger with one action

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,840
to form rules such as if I receive a new

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,020
email the remixable speaker

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,080
however as great as they sound like tabs

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,960
also with serious privacy concerns we

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,000
should we will show that they are over

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,979
privileged at two different levels

29
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,520
allowing them to access formal data than

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,159
what they need to function just

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,020
violating the principle of

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,600
determinilization in gdpr

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
I will then talk about mintab which is a

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
system we designed to enhance privacy by

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,520
leveraging language-based dependency

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,799
tracking techniques

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,259
I will also talk about the Privacy

38
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,200
benefits of deploying mintab on existing

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,240
tab providers

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,060
so here we use ift which is one of the

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,180
most popular top providers to illustrate

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,700
the privacy concerns in real context

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,340
if as 20 millions of users with

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,640
connection to more than 600 services

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,239
being a such centralized Hub of user

46
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,879
data if it's not only suspectful to

47
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,640
hacking but it's term of use especially

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,340
states that it may provide you data

49
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,680
directly to third parties

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,200
uh services like Gmail has already

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,959
removed its triggers from it due to

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,300
privacy concerns just limiting the

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,120
functionality of it

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,120
we now show how exactly tab is over

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
privileged in two levels the first one

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,580
is at token level this one has already

57
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,700
been pointed out by prior work basically

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,920
say that if a user only has one simple

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,280
rule that triggers a new file is

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,560
uploaded to his Google Drive

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,500
eighth will in turn request a very

62
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,480
powerful token from Google

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,860
that can basically do everything

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,140
including reading sharing or even

65
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,879
deleting your files

66
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,280
the reason behind this design is to

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,319
improve user experience

68
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,120
since this token exchange process

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920
requires user input

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
such as going through an authorization

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,180
prompt like this one which I'm sure many

72
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,739
of you have encountered before

73
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,800
so by acquiring all powerful token

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,319
during the first time tab can vote is

75
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,239
such an annoying process if the user

76
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,220
wants to create a Google Drive New sorry

77
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,819
a new Google drive to in the future

78
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,580
the second level of oral privilege comes

79
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,319
from the attribute level

80
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,959
this time let's assume the rule gets a

81
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,180
bit more complicated where it only

82
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,480
Triggers on some specific condition say

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,299
that like only when the file is uploaded

84
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,360
during work hours and only a subset of

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,379
attribute is needed

86
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,480
however since Google Drive has no notion

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,120
of what the user actually wants it will

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,819
keep telling the tab about every files

89
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,940
users have uploaded as well as every

90
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,819
attribute of the file even though if you

91
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,280
recall the original rule like the

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,019
majority of the data is really not

93
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,060
needed to perform the use action

94
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,760
um so our solution to this problem is

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,519
mintab which is a design of the Trigger

96
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,918
action ecosystem where trigger service

97
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,380
should only send data that are necessary

98
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,180
for rule execution

99
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,759
in addition it allows for commutation

100
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,040
which is an emerging new feature

101
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,800
provided by tabs to express root

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,960
conditions in JavaScript

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,479
finally it should be backward compatible

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,000
with the current system so meantime can

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,280
be deployed readily to systems like if

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,479
it is requiring changes at their end

107
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,360
so first so first let's briefly go over

108
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,880
the current design of tab

109
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,820
the user's first program rules through a

110
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,880
tab client which usually takes a form of

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
a smartphone app or a web page then

112
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,220
whenever the trigger event happens the

113
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,979
trigger sends the data to the tab the

114
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,979
data consists of several attributes to

115
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,680
describe the event which in this case we

116
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,320
have the name the upload time the path

117
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,440
and the content of a new file

118
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,900
button the tab will compute the use

119
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,020
function on the trigger data to Output

120
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,600
the action data and the form its to the

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,979
action service

122
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,620
in mean tab we model the tab as a

123
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,259
compromise party under this threat model

124
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,380
we now instruct the client to compute

125
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,300
the minimizer that satisfies the

126
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,280
following condition

127
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,220
the output of applying the original rule

128
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,820
F on the trigger data is equivalent to

129
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,900
First applying the minimizer and and

130
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,680
applying if

131
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,139
in this way we can think this minimizer

132
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,419
as a preprocessor on the trigger data

133
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,660
and has no effect on the output which is

134
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,100
action data

135
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,440
the minimeter will be applied by the

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,020
trigger service and the trigger data

137
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,660
whenever the trigger event happens

138
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,479
the goal of the minimizer is to remove

139
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,660
all the attribute in the trigger data

140
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,180
that are not needed to actually execute

141
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,440
the action

142
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,020
so in our two example attribute like

143
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,840
paths or content will be sanitized and

144
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,720
replaced by some garbage values

145
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,960
finally on the top instead of running on

146
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,360
the trigger data we will now run on the

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,800
minimize

148
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,100
on the on the minimized trigger trigger

149
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,620
data however because of the guarantee

150
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,960
that this minimized amp provides the

151
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,780
action data will always remain unchanged

152
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,600
well the tab learns significantly less

153
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,139
data

154
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,180
so how do we generate this minimizer

155
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,819
first like look at the structure of

156
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,340
automation rule it is composed of an

157
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,100
expert under some part which is the

158
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,340
trigger and the action of this rule

159
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,220
like whatever a new file is uploaded

160
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,160
could to your Cloud Drive please send a

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
notification message like whose content

162
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
includes the name of the new file

163
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,780
recently tab providers are beginning to

164
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,300
allow users to additionally specify the

165
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,660
so-called filter code part in the rules

166
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,000
this filter code can be used for two

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
purpose one is to instruct a tab when

168
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,819
the actions should be escaped the second

169
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,520
is to replace some of the action values

170
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,280
dynamically like in this example here

171
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,400
when like when uh Windsor found them

172
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
extension is jpeg then instead of file

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
content as the attachment of the

174
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,780
notification

175
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,660
uh you mean tab we provide two different

176
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,360
variants of the minimizer that have

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,639
given the trade-off here I will provide

178
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,560
some high level intuition behind each

179
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,020
minimizer please refer to overall paper

180
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,599
for more details

181
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,940
the static analysis the static minimizer

182
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,860
is very straightforward by applying a

183
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,780
static analyze on the filter code and

184
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,000
accurate configuration we can find out

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,680
which trigger

186
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,740
which which fake attributes will appear

187
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,360
in the room

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,419
by contrast this Dynamic minimizer takes

189
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,539
the actual trigger data as input in

190
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,400
addition to the rule information

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,979
to determine a more precise side of the

192
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,160
required attribute at a runtime it

193
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,440
enhance and transform the filter code

194
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,740
into a data dependency tracking function

195
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,659
that Returns the set of attributes

196
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,419
accessed and the set of action values

197
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,880
overwritten as if the original filter

198
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,099
code were to be run by the time

199
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,959
this Dynamic minimizer is most effective

200
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,019
when there is escape now we see that the

201
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,420
timestamp is at four o'clock and the

202
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,940
condition of the skipping has been made

203
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,060
so no no data needs to be sent to the

204
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,160
action services the trigger service can

205
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,480
simply abort the process

206
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,820
by comparison this Dynamic minimizer is

207
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,279
activated High Precision especially when

208
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,980
branching exists in filter code but it

209
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,779
also imposes more latency over height

210
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,120
due to the need for runtime execution

211
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,740
and sandbox isolation

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,080
so the overall data flow of mean type

213
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,700
goes in the following order

214
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,220
when the user sets up the rule the

215
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,560
client will compute the minimizer and

216
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,360
the status are part of the trigger

217
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,440
attribute

218
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,959
in the execution phase when the tab

219
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
transfer call the trigger API to pull

220
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,160
the data it will automatically pass it

221
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,140
in the method to the figure service at

222
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,899
which place so we extend the existing

223
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,120
tab capability layer in the services to

224
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,459
execute the minimizer and to send text

225
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,700
attributes in addition to prevent

226
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,160
Malaysia sampling of the minimizer the

227
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,279
client will also include a signature

228
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,800
to account for this change we also

229
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,779
extend upon the existing service

230
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,420
authorization protocol or us to allow

231
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,680
the trigger service to additionally

232
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,720
recognize our legitimate user's client

233
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,980
and accept our client public key without

234
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,200
requiring additional user input

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,240
the second part of our study is to

236
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,279
understand the level of our privilege in

237
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,920
the world for this we Cloud if to

238
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,080
collect a data set of automation rules

239
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,300
when you created a new strategy for

240
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,399
crawling eight which allows us to

241
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,420
acquire

242
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,880
the they do the detailed configuration

243
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,860
inside each rule including the filter

244
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,899
code and the exactly configuration

245
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,899
regression which is both also for which

246
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,240
is crucial to our analyze and are

247
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,220
impossible to get the previous data

248
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,600
collection tools

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,360
the future the future filtered out the

250
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,920
rules that are connected to public

251
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,339
triggers like weather than news and we

252
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,700
end up with around 34

253
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,800
000 rules connecting private triggers

254
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,680
the triggers associated with users

255
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,160
private or personal accounts

256
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,920
the figure on the bottom left bottom

257
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,140
right shows a CDF of the number of

258
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,899
attributes per Rule and we can see that

259
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,640
more than 50 percent

260
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,980
of these rules have access to more than

261
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,380
five attributes

262
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,779
by analyzing the root conditions we

263
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,940
found that on average out of this

264
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,940
attributes 3.6 of them are not needed

265
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,500
for rule execution

266
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,779
the CDF of this attributes are shown in

267
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,420
the orange line if mean time were to be

268
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,839
deployed all of them will be sanitized

269
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,120
in addition we manually exam and

270
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,820
categorize these unused attributes and

271
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,500
found that the majority of them

272
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,140
represent highly sensitive information

273
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,240
like uses personal personal information

274
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,019
location or direct downloadable links

275
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,839
as a result uh undoubtedly gave us a

276
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,579
warning that the problem of oral

277
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,339
privilege in kernel tabs is a serious

278
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,980
threat to the privacy of user data and

279
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,839
we hope Solutions like our mean tab

280
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,700
could start to take off and help to

281
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,740
elevate such problems

282
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,720
so now I will open the floor for

283
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,640
questions and you may also contact me

284
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,459
offline or check our artifact in GitHub
