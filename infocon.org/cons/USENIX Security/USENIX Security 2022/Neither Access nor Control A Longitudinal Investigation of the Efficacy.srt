1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,340
thanks for listening today I'll be

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,500
presenting our paper title neither

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,260
access nor control in which we evaluate

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,359
and compare the efficacy of existing

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,340
user access control Solutions on

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,080
smartphones

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,420
so phone security in general is becoming

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,699
more important this is because the

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,500
capabilities of the phones are improving

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,420
going from the old way of only using the

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,340
phones for making phone calls or sending

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,559
text messages to not using them for a

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,360
variety of applications

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,820
this has made it so that users store and

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,800
access more sensitive data and services

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,320
on the devices and as a result the

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,940
damage they would incur if there were

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,800
any unauthorized access to their phones

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,899
has increased

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,239
in order to try and mitigate the risk of

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,760
such unauthorized access one important

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,980
aspect to consider is physical security

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,379
which is securely in the presence of

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,719
physical access to the phone

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,059
generally there are two systems involved

26
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,159
in preserving physical security

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,200
first there is the authentication system

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
which confirms the user's identity and

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,700
then there's the access control system

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,680
which controls what the user can do on

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,240
the phone after going through

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,920
Authentication

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,200
currently on the phone's authentication

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,939
is designed around the explicit

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,580
authentication pattern where in order to

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,200
prove to the phone that you are the

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,119
authentic user you either have to

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,460
provide a pin or some sort of biometric

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,860
scan such as a fingerprint

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,960
access control is designed around the

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,479
All or Nothing model where if the user

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,759
is unauthenticated the phone is locked

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,500
and none of its functionalities is

44
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,780
available and If the user gets

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,220
authenticated then the phone gets

46
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,680
unlocked and now all functionalities are

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
available and there is no other estate

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,659
on the phone in our prayer work we had

49
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,340
already investigated how existing

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,979
authentication Solutions fare for users

51
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,979
so in this paper we focus solely on

52
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,560
access control Solutions

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
as it turns out there are already

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,240
qualitative studies that show all or

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,758
nothing to be dissatisfying users

56
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,340
there are two major issues identified

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,680
with the All or Nothing model

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,200
first there's this disregard for task

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,900
sensitivity which basically means even

60
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,120
though the tasks users perform on their

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
phones have different levels of security

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,819
requirements the although nothing treats

63
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,319
all of them the same

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,599
for example if the user wants to Simply

65
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,760
read a book the phone is still required

66
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,500
unlocking which some users might

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,140
perceive as unnecessary conversely if

68
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,000
the user wants to perform something very

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,860
sensitive such as Financial operations

70
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,379
the phone itself still only requires a

71
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,540
one-time authentication at the beginning

72
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,060
of the session which some users might

73
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,280
perceive as insufficient

74
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,319
the second issue with All or Nothing is

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,300
its lack of support for phone sharing

76
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,160
even though the practice is shown to be

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,739
quite prevalent basically it does not

78
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,019
allow a primary user to control what the

79
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,420
secondary user somebody that the primary

80
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,340
user has decided to share the phone with

81
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,140
can do on the phone

82
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,420
so this might lead to the secondary

83
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,819
users looping on the primary user's data

84
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,760
and uses the satisfaction

85
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,099
there are some Alternatives proposed to

86
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,780
try and mitigate these issues with All

87
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,940
or Nothing to provide better task

88
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,879
sensitivity the currently available

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,319
alternative solution is lock screen

90
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,459
access

91
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,800
which allows the user to launch certain

92
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,480
apps such as the camera or the

93
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,519
flashlight from the lock screen without

94
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,680
having to go through Authentication

95
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,780
but there are more elaborate Solutions

96
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,420
proposing the literature such as ones

97
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,819
that are app or task level allowing the

98
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,680
user to specify different security

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,260
requirements for different apps or even

100
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,540
different tasks of which there might be

101
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
multiple per each app

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,799
there are also context-based Solutions

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,860
which allow the user to deny or allow

104
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,560
access to certain tasks or apps in a

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,840
specific context such as at certain

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,120
locations

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
to better provide phone sharing support

108
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,019
commercially available Solutions include

109
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,659
profile switching which allows the user

110
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,180
to specify different profiles for each

111
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,400
secondary user and control what apps

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,680
they have access to and there's also app

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,500
pinning that allows the user to pin and

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,060
app to the screen of the phone and

115
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,919
prevent the seconded user from switching

116
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,600
to a different app

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
other Solutions available in the

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,280
literature include diffuser which limits

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,259
secondary users access to certain phone

120
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,960
resources such as Bluetooth

121
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,419
and there's xshare which introduces a

122
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,979
restricted mode to the phone with access

123
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,740
to only certain apps so the primary user

124
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,479
can put the phone in this restricted

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,940
mode before handing it to a secondary

126
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,139
user

127
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,139
however the issue is is that even though

128
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,440
all these alternatives are proposed they

129
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,139
are never actually

130
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,460
evaluated and compared against each

131
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,740
other in a quantitative way and this is

132
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,139
what we are going to do in this paper

133
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,300
the research questions we were focusing

134
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,120
on were first what tasks do a smartphone

135
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,340
users perform on their phones what are

136
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,139
their sharing preferences for the tasks

137
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,780
these first for us to get a detailed

138
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,940
look into the user's Access Control

139
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,380
needs

140
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,540
then once we have this data we could

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,919
move to the second research position

142
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,919
which was about comparing Solutions

143
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,199
basically we wanted to note what extent

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
in terms of false positive rate and

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,220
false negative rate do all or nothing

146
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,199
and the alternative Solutions meet the

147
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,060
user's needs how do they compare in

148
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,979
configuration size rate

149
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,440
so we have three metrics to compare the

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,960
solutions based on first it was false

151
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,880
positive rate which would indicate how

152
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,400
often a solution would mistakenly Grant

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,680
access to a task to an unauthorized user

154
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,020
and so it would reflect on the security

155
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,820
of a solution

156
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,860
false negative rate would indicate how

157
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,919
often a solution would mistakenly deny

158
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,259
access to a task to an authorized user

159
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,199
so it would reflect on the usability of

160
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,720
a solution and lastly configuration size

161
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,139
rate was a basic estimate of how much

162
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,780
effort is required to set up a solution

163
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,000
so again it will reflect on the

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,740
usability of a solution

165
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,080
and lastly with regards to phone sharing

166
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,759
we wanted to know how consistent our

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
contextual factors across four sharing

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,660
events such as with whom the phone is

169
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,520
shared so are these factors useful for

170
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,100
making better Access Control decisions

171
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,259
to answer these questions we conducted a

172
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,319
longitudinal diary study we developed a

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,319
custom Android app and asked 55 emptied

174
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,940
participants to install it on their

175
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,100
personal phones and use it for at least

176
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,340
30 days they use the app to fill in

177
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,440
Daily Diaries where we asked them to

178
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,960
First list all the tasks they perform

179
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
with each app on their phone

180
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
then the sharing preferences for each

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,100
task basically we wanted them to let us

182
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,780
know whom they would be willing to allow

183
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,060
to perform each task on their phones and

184
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,440
the options they could choose where no

185
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,539
one only certain people such as their

186
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,880
spouses or anybody

187
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,039
and lastly we wanted them to let us know

188
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,300
if they had shared their phone with

189
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,039
anybody throughout the day and if so

190
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,080
what was the context for example where

191
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,300
did the sharing happened with whom and

192
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,300
to perform which tasks

193
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,580
lastly we use qualitative coding and

194
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,039
descriptive statistics to analyze this

195
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,660
data and we occasionally also use

196
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,759
chi-square tests

197
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,319
as for the results for the first

198
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
research question we found diverse tasks

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
and complex needs overall there were

200
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,259
1149 different tasks cleared by the

201
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,400
participants with 575 different apps and

202
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,280
on average there were 74 different tasks

203
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,500
per person and two per app

204
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,620
as for the needs we found 24 of the

205
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,840
tasks to be labeled as being shareable

206
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,419
with specific people and 19 percent to

207
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,220
be shareable with anybody

208
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,080
but they've also found significant

209
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,819
individual differences amongst the

210
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,120
participants with regards to their needs

211
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,759
as this graph shows a significant number

212
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,800
of the participants did not want to

213
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,560
share any task with anybody so for them

214
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
an All or Nothing model of Access

215
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
Control would work just fine

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,460
another minority of the participants

217
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,500
wanted to share all of their tasks with

218
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,780
specific people or with everyone so

219
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,220
again for them the All or Nothing

220
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,500
solution would work just fine

221
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,680
however for the majority they had more

222
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,199
complex needs and wanted to be able to

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,539
share a specific tasks with specific

224
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,399
groups of people and so they would

225
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,440
require a more complex solution than the

226
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
All or Nothing

227
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,520
naturally then when we use this data to

228
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,140
compare the solutions we found the more

229
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,380
granular ones to thrive

230
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,360
as for solutions that provide task

231
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,820
sensitivity we start with All or Nothing

232
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,860
which was found to be inefficient we

233
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,779
found that if the old scenario is played

234
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,360
out that the phone is always unlocked up

235
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,940
to 90 percent of the user's tasks could

236
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,940
be exposed to unauthorized users and

237
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,680
conversely if the nothing scenario is

238
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,360
played out that the phone is always

239
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,880
locked up to 21 of the phone's

240
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,459
unlockings could be unnecessary in

241
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,019
comparison the lock screen solution

242
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,360
seemed to be ineffective as it didn't

243
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,580
change the situation much compared to

244
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,320
their nothing scenario

245
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,540
our Global models found to be providing

246
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,120
a nice balance between the three metrics

247
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,300
fpr fnr and CSR and task level models

248
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,980
were found to be even more accurate and

249
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,860
reducing FBR and fnr even further

250
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,540
however they came with a higher

251
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,820
trade-off in terms of configuration size

252
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,700
rates so there might not be for everyone

253
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,860
as for phone sharing we found again all

254
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,620
or nothing to be inefficient

255
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,779
profile switching to be highly effective

256
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,480
in terms of eliminating fpr and fnr

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,279
however it can be the significant

258
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,140
trade-off in terms of configuration size

259
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,040
right

260
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
as for the other Solutions we found next

261
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,779
year to be performing the best and

262
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,640
providing nice balance between the three

263
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,220
metrics for a third research question we

264
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,140
found context to be fairly consistent

265
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,839
across phone sharing nodes I'll provide

266
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,300
two examples here firstly with regards

267
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,820
to location we found that 86 percent of

268
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,399
sharings happen at home so future

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
Solutions can try to improve Access

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,300
Control by denying access to certain

271
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,880
shareable tasks at locations other than

272
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,959
home

273
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,480
and secondly with regards to sharees we

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,060
found that 89 of Shanks happen with

275
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,580
immediate family members so the set of

276
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,240
possible secondary users is rather

277
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,860
limited and this provides evidence for

278
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,500
the feasibility of user identification

279
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,560
on smartphones

280
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,200
in conclusion then in this paper we

281
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
provided quantitative evidence for the

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,380
following

283
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,480
firstly we showed users Access Control

284
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,420
needs to be complex there are many tasks

285
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,339
that they perform on their phones and

286
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,740
the tasks are scattered along a wide

287
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,079
range of sensitivity levels but also

288
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,420
uses preferences for sharing these tasks

289
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,000
very significantly by task functionality

290
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,700
and also the user's personality

291
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,440
they also found the implemented

292
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,660
solutions to be suboptimal although

293
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,060
nothing can have an fpr as high as 90

294
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,079
percent and an fnr as high as 21 percent

295
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
and some of the commercially available

296
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,560
alternative Solutions such as lock

297
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,320
screen access only provide marginal

298
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Improvement at around one percent

299
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,540
and lastly we found some of the proposed

300
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,519
solutions to be promising for task

301
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,980
sensitivity we found app level and for

302
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,660
phone sharing we found session and

303
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,420
content space solutions to be promising

304
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,579
in terms of striking a nice balance

305
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,200
between the three metrics that we

306
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,260
measured and so it might be a promising

307
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,300
Avenue for future research to look

308
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,060
further into these solutions for example

309
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,880
to see how the user experience might be

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,620
designed

311
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,720
thanks again for listening if you have

312
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,000
