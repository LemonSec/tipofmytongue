00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,280
hello everyone welcome to the

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,920
presentation of our paper birth of a

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,500
cider Vlog together outside Bears have

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,020
2D known manual we are reviewed in the

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,460
section setting

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,580
my name is and this is my joint work

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,359
with Zach

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,159
let's begin with a brief introduction to

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,980
secure two-party computation or to PC

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,840
for Shout

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,780
a 2tc protocol can be regarded as a

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,079
black box that loss NS and bulb to

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,120
jointly compute a military output

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
function f on their input data

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,379
here F captures a collaborative data

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,899
analysis task in a given real world

17
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,160
scenario

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
the security of two PC ensures that each

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,800
party can only learn its output

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,140
performance by function f

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,920
and it cannot directly see the input of

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,380
the output of the other part

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,560
the security guarantee makes two PC are

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,780
attractive tool to address privacy

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,280
concerns in collaborative data analysis

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,860
in our work we are interested in

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,140
intersection related to data analysis

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,280
tasks

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,159
an important analysis task of this can

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,100
is called with 19 context tracing

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,280
in this task a user will collaborate

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,040
with the health authority to identify

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,460
whether it has been in contact with

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,020
infected patients

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,960
this task has been done by comparing the

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,900
two parties list of individual tokens

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,899
and announcing the intersection side

38
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,540
if this intersection says in Narnia room

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,220
the user may be exposed to covet 19.

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,899
there are some other intersection

41
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,840
related analysis tasks considered in the

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
industry such as Computing and

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,419
conversion rate and add corrosion left

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,959
in these two advertising scenarios the

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,940
underlying intersection includes the

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,879
individual's commonly recorded in both

47
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,060
the advertisers the population's

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,260
databases

49
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,900
such individuals were recorded by both

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,840
parties since they made a connection of

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
particular interests such as clicking or

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,200
viewing the ad of some product

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,959
in the above scenarios during the

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,000
intersection to other party is

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,819
unacceptable since this practice leads

56
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,560
to one party each individual's

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,519
membership of the other parties database

58
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,800
this membership leakage can cause

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,920
privacy threat to the individuals in one

60
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,540
parties database

61
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,540
so some two PC particles have been

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,540
proposed to compute the desired analysis

63
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,360
results without revealing the underlying

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,220
intersection

65
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,459
however 2pc cannot address all privacy

66
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,000
issues in collaborative data analysis it

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is possible that one party uses its

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
input and output to infer the other

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,620
parties input or output

70
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,680
we give a simple example here in this

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,099
example both can infer access input from

72
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,599
a subtraction

73
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,420
this example indicates that even

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,599
analysis task is implemented with two PC

75
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,640
there may be still some undeniable

76
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,099
information dated from the 2pc output

77
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,799
in this work we propose two influencer

78
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,040
attacks in these three scenarios our

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,220
attacks are based on two observations we

80
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,799
show that the set membership leakage is

81
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
possible in the three scenarios we also

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,200
show that they have membership leakage

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,840
can be accelerated by a non-week set

84
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,019
bias

85
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,840
means that one part is input data tend

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,000
to include individuals of particular

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,659
features for example in covid-19 contact

88
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,540
tracing infecting patients recorded by

89
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,760
the health authority tend to have a

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,279
favor or cause

91
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,800
now we model the set membership

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
influence problem in our work

93
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,740
we consider the following two-party

94
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,880
session

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,199
iris is a victim with a dynamic site of

96
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,080
is the attacker the attention is input

97
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,600
set and Regulation and intersection

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,419
cells revealing to PC particle with high

99
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,500
list

100
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,479
this intersection side revealing

101
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,400
particle Returns the current

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,699
intersection set of the two-party sets

103
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,060
to Bob

104
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,040
is motivated to learn some Target

105
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,340
individual set membership regarding the

106
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,699
dynamic side of Alice

107
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,699
attack

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,020
in this attack both Imports a set of

109
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,840
only one target individual in each

110
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,759
particle invocation

111
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,460
the intersection side is indeed the set

112
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,400
membership of the target individual

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,340
in this attack both need to go through

114
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,039
all target individuals to determine

115
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,919
their set membership

116
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,680
in this Baseline attack both knows

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,479
nothing but the intersection standards

118
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,580
from particular invocations

119
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,340
to make four years of The Limited number

120
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,160
of particle implications both can

121
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,560
perform its influencer tags using a

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,620
binary search lag strategy it requires

123
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,580
the partitions the whole side of Target

124
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,440
individuals into non-overlapping

125
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,900
subsides according to a balanced binary

126
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,860
tree

127
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,800
the root node of the tree in the whole

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,680
side and each node is the non-active

129
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,100
subset of its parent node

130
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,979
both with the surgery using a depth

131
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,380
first research and using the current

132
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,259
node as the input to the current

133
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,479
particle invocation

134
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,780
if the returned intersection size equals

135
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,460
the set of a subset

136
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,639
both spots a subset of the individuals

137
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,100
in set of islands

138
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,460
then it terminates the current depth

139
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,560
first research and starts the next

140
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,440
research

141
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,440
we also introduce a priority score for

142
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,759
optimization

143
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,060
this score measures the ratio of the

144
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,759
number of intersecting individuals to

145
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,280
the number of all individuals in the

146
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
current subtree

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,539
Bob always goes into the subtree with

148
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,159
hair priority score

149
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,259
this practice can help both terminate

150
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,840
the current depth first research as soon

151
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,780
as possible and improve its influence

152
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,060
efficiency

153
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,699
our second attack considers a stronger

154
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,100
attacker that additionally knows some

155
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,259
features regarding the bias in the set

156
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,580
of Alice

157
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,100
this is why we call it future view

158
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,259
attack

159
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,300
intuitively the knowledge of set bias

160
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,419
tells both that he targets individuals

161
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,699
with certain features are more likely in

162
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,560
the set of Alice

163
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,860
we stress let her know we accept bias is

164
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,639
possible in realistic scenarios

165
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,160
the intuition behind our virtual real

166
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,220
Attack is that Bob can use the bias

167
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,380
related features to real range in the

168
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,520
binary tree

169
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,039
so that's the individuals with similar

170
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,500
features are clustered to the same

171
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,000
subset

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,580
if the bias in the set of Alice in

173
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,160
Northwick and both collects some

174
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
features regarding This spells this

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
attack has low bulb to reinforce set

176
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,620
membership of Target individuals in

177
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,819
batch

178
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,699
in this work we discussed what will

179
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,160
happen when we apply our text to a

180
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,419
dynamic set

181
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,520
this detail can be found in our paper

182
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,440
in our evaluation we consider three

183
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,979
realistic scenarios for each scenario we

184
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,979
use our public data sets to evaluate our

185
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,319
text as a Toyota tag

186
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,900
we also consider the following realistic

187
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,860
frequencies of particle invocation

188
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,260
we have some summaries of the victim

189
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,159
site in these scenarios

190
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,640
please check our paper for details

191
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
we simulate the input to be used by the

192
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
attacker first we consider several

193
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,339
overlap degrees between the attackers

194
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,980
targeted individuals and the individuals

195
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,220
in the victim sets 30 degrees capture

196
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,380
different data distribution of the

197
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,040
attacker second to satisfy this overlap

198
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
degrees we uniformless and for many

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,860
individuals from the data set population

200
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,019
and use this sampled individuals as a

201
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,399
Target ones

202
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,880
to simulate a feature Vera tiger we only

203
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,459
use some features easy to collect in

204
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,839
real life to avoid an unrealistic attack

205
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,380
here we present some of our experimental

206
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,680
results

207
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,040
the detailed breakdown of these results

208
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,420
can be found in our paper

209
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,180
there are some negative consequences

210
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,339
that may result from set membership

211
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,600
leakage

212
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,300
for example in call with 19 contact

213
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,420
tracing they infected patient's deduce

214
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,459
from the leakage may suffer from

215
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,019
harassment

216
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,440
in the two advertising scenarios The

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,839
Advertiser may take advantage of this

218
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,899
leakage to deduce personal interests

219
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,019
without an implicit agreement of

220
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,360
individuals

221
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,940
due to the preconditions of our attacks

222
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,980
we can consider the following four

223
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,399
defense methods against them we also

224
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,800
discussed the limitation of each defense

225
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,080
method in our paper

226
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,200
in conclusion our work studies the set

227
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,720
membership leakage in intersection set

228
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,060
reading protocols that are widely used

229
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,920
in the industry

230
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
we present two-step membership inference

231
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,260
attacks for attackers with different

232
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,000
background knowledge

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,060
we show that the preconditions of these

234
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,220
attacks can be met in realistic

235
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,519
scenarios and prevent the evaluation

236
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,459
results under certain data distribution

237
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,640
in these scenarios

238
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,640
we hope that our work can help the

239
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,399
industry unless the actual privacy

240
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,980
guarantee of intersections and reading

241
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,360
particles in realistic scenarios

242
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,279
that's all of my presentation please

feel free to contact us if you have any

244
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,360
