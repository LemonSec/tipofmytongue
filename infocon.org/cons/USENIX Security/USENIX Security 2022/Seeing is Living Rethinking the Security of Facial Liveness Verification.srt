1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,799
today I'm very happy to introduce our

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,079
recent work thing is leaving rethinking

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,119
the security of facial liveliest

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,420
verification in the Deep thick Europe

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,600
facial analysis verification has been

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,820
become more and more popular in our day

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,980
life especially for some security

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,520
sensitive applications like Banking and

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,399
cryptocurrency exchanges they use they

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,239
requires the kyc policy to verify the

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,719
user's identity only those users that

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
pass the kyc verification can conduct

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,379
the transactions as facial analysis

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,420
verification becomes more and more

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,079
popular many Cloud vendors began to

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,680
provide it as a service service

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,899
according to the requirement official

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,000
Navigator verification can be divided

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,180
into four groups uh the first one is

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,920
image based efficient Navigator

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,380
verification it just requires static

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,360
image to verify the user's identity

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,260
second is um

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,880
silence based patient navigation

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,640
location it requires the user's facial

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,640
video and doesn't require any other

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,220
requirements and the third one is

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,080
voice-based official name is

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,780
verification it requests the user

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,320
speaking given digits and the last one

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,740
is the action based navinis verification

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,340
it requires the user

34
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,920
doing some actions like closing your

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,400
eyes open your mouse and so on so this

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,460
is a facial navis verification

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,200
um generally the official 90s

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
verification is pipeline can be divided

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,799
into three steps the first step is the

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,380
user interacts with the apps these apps

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,380
are provided by a banking garment and

42
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,659
other

43
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,818
sensitive Department

44
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,580
the second step is these apps will

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,580
capture the user's facial images or

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,360
videos and then these apps were called

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,300
the API with this captured videos or

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
images and these apps we can verify the

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,520
user's identity based on the response

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,280
written by the API

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,340
another topic related to our work is the

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,980
fake defect has raised a great interest

53
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,300
in recent years especially with

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,540
some free apps available available in

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,040
some app stores next door and re-face

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,739
people can easily create fake videos

57
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,379
very easy

58
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,319
without requiring any expertise so

59
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,400
difficult also increase uh cause a great

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,280
stress to cyber security and the

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,440
sociology for example recent news

62
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,160
reported that some adversaries USB fake

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,760
to create a person doesn't exist and

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,459
then use that identity to get the

65
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,800
textures you know during the covid-19

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,860
many Tech combinations

67
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,560
companies provide the

68
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,519
work from work from home options so some

69
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,019
adversaries may use defect to get

70
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,780
multiple jobs as the theme time

71
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,379
zero other there there are there are

72
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,379
also some other risks caused by the fake

73
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,540
like the tax scam and porn videos so it

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,560
is a great threat to our society

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,080
so a direct director research question

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,319
is how is facial analysis verification

77
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,440
vulnerable to uh defect based attacks

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,780
can we use defect bypass visual

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,640
navigation relocation this is our

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,179
motivation

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,159
uh to answer this question we decide and

82
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,140
Implement a new bugger this is a

83
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,379
framework in increase various sort of

84
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,780
defect techniques for evaluating the

85
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,420
security of visual analysis verification

86
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,320
systems since the since API is the

87
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,740
source of the supply chain so many Forks

88
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,139
on efficient ability verification API

89
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,400
since it is is a security risks where

90
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,520
certain many Downstream

91
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,639
um applications this framework consists

92
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,460
of consists of three parts the first is

93
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,280
in intelligence engine if many used to

94
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,740
collect the information of the target

95
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,800
platform and then we can construct a

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,759
superset of the uh apis then either

97
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,100
first thing takes a configuration based

98
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,880
evaluation gave a specific

99
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,220
configuration like the target person tag

100
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,740
API as some other features like the

101
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,280
digit names we can use the Deep figure

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,780
engine to synthesize a realistic video

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,139
as them and then like an analysis engine

104
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,620
will fill the

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,960
[Music]

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
created fake videos to the apis and it

107
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,860
can analysis the robustness of the

108
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,840
target system by some custom customers

109
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,000
tricks metrics

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,660
according to our evaluation all types of

111
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,520
facial analysis verification are

112
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,699
vulnerable to config based attacks we

113
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,440
can achieve achieve up to 60 percent

114
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
overall evasion rates

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,759
and also we find that entity vehicle

116
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,419
should be further improved even though

117
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,000
some vendors even though some vendors

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,300
claim that they have deployed The Entity

119
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,960
fake detection but we find this their

120
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,620
detections is problematic

121
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,220
some some videos with very obvious

122
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,740
artifacts can also bypass the official

123
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,699
navigation verification

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,479
um with them select some applications

125
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,039
there to use these apis

126
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,800
to illustrate the real world straight we

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,060
conduct a POC attack to to we first

128
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,139
hijacked the video stream and then we

129
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,300
synthesize the fake videos in a

130
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,639
real-time manner then we can fill the

131
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,259
fake video stream into the target

132
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,759
application we find that we can

133
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,300
bypass the most of the applications

134
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,479
foreign

135
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,539
observations and evaluations we provide

136
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,120
some security insights the first one is

137
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,060
anti-defic detection is necessary for

138
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,580
efficient facial analysis verification

139
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,319
systems

140
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,100
um

141
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,139
the second one is voice based official

142
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,240
navigation verification should consider

143
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,300
the match of nip movements with the

144
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,780
audio single or even voice print to

145
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,759
improve the security according to our

146
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,860
evaluation you will find one of the

147
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,759
vendors only

148
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,520
detects the audio singular

149
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,500
separately this means you just need to

150
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,880
import a audio signal and you can bypass

151
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,620
the API

152
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,800
foreign

153
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,580
obvious artifacts in the create in the

154
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,220
fake videos like if you move move your

155
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,780
cat left or right 90 degrees so when

156
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,539
they in the in this scenarios they think

157
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,720
maybe hard to synthesize the realistic

158
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
videos

159
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,039
so it maybe can be helpful for detecting

160
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,539
fake videos

161
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,539
as last one is increased diversity of

162
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,840
actions or voice prompts prompts

163
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,080
this can greatly increase the cost of

164
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,080
adversary to create a fake videos by

165
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
default

166
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,020
we have reported our findings to the

167
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,899
effective vendors and receive active

168
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,479
feedback

169
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,700
one of the vendors even claimed that

170
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,620
they have joined a difficult detection

171
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,180
program to mitigate such attacks they

172
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,200
all of the admit is that it is still a

173
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
challenge problem to solve this so we

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,820
think this deserves more future research

175
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,640
in conclusion we design and Implement

176
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,380
new bugger this is a first of its kind

177
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,779
framework for evaluating the security

178
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,300
official navigation verification systems

179
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,640
by Deep fakes

180
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,839
uh lives we use this framework to

181
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,620
conduct extensive immunization and find

182
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,920
that most facial analysis verification

183
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,480
systems are vulnerable to defect based

184
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,019
attacks and the xan and we perform POC

185
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,760
attacks in a real world setting and

186
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
provide some interest insights to

187
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
improve the security of physics

188
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,899
verification

189
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,600
uh thank you for listening I'm ready for

190
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,959
question
