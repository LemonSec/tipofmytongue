1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,960
um hi everyone

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm shooting I'm going to present fish

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,700
in ships clothing exploring the

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,560
authentication peoples of browser

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,880
fingerprinting

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,779
this is a joint world with panels

7
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:25,279
and my advisor Jason power kiss

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,080
Two-Face authentication is an effective

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,080
way to protect user accounts however it

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,480
creates friction for users

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,360
certain websites only trigger to fa for

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,520
suspicious logging attempts

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,520
these websites remember the device if a

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,579
user login and if the next login is from

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,120
the same device to FH skip

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,879
if not it's considered as a suspicious

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,840
login attempt and 2fa is triggered

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,360
websites may use cookies or IP address

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,699
to remember device

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,920
currently browser fingerprints are

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,440
widely used for web tracking

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,560
and they can be easily collected by any

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,100
website without using interaction

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,100
for this reason some Advanced respect

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,080
authentication system use browser

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,880
fingerprinting to remember the device

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,159
in this system user visits the login

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,619
page and a website sends the

29
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,780
fingerprinting script to collect the

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,900
user's fingerprints

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,720
if this fingerprint is different from

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,520
the previous login it triggers 2fa

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,240
if two fingerprints are matched 2fa is

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Skip and user directly logs into the

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,360
account

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,079
however

37
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,500
this system is vulnerable to our attack

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,140
in our stream model we assume that the

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,079
attacker is able to trick the user into

40
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,540
visiting a malicious website and

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,979
entering layer of credentials

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,240
here is an overview of our attack

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,799
workflow

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,500
there are three phases and we develop

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,700
two extensions to perform this attack

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,459
next I will introduce each phase and our

47
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,060
extensions

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,340
in the first phase attacker will use the

49
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,140
fingerprint extractor extension

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,700
when the website collects the browser

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,520
fingerprints the extension automatically

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,459
replicates the fingerprinting process of

53
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,140
the Target website

54
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,660
it generates the fingerprinting code for

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,620
this Target website

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,620
in the next phase attacker has the

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,840
fingerprinting code for Target websites

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,940
that collected from the previous face

59
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,519
they can use it to build a Vision

60
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,840
website

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,879
and this fishing website can have

62
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,340
multiple Target websites fingerprinting

63
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,180
code

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,000
which means when a user visits this

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Vision website the pages collect all the

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,000
the Fingerprints of this user's device

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,159
for all these Target websites

68
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
learning attacker have the attackers

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
credentials and the sorry now your

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,620
attacker has the user's credentials and

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,739
uses fingerprints

72
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,659
so in the last phase

73
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,940
otaker is ready to perform the attack on

74
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,400
the Target website

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,379
I'll take her first enable the

76
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,860
fingerprint buffer extension

77
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,379
when the website tries to collect the

78
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,819
attacker's fingerprints

79
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,620
the extension replaced the attacker's

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,599
fingerprints with the user's

81
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,940
fingerprints and he tricks the website

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,940
into thinking that this logging is from

83
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,239
the legitimate user

84
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,420
the attackers successfully bypass 2fa

85
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,940
and logs into the user account

86
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,959
here I will introduce the extensions

87
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,180
how fingerprint extractor extension

88
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,500
works

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,199
this extension is used in the first

90
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,380
phase and is used to replicate the

91
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,919
fingerprinting curve of a Target website

92
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,919
it first ingest the cultural Target

93
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,500
websites document

94
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,540
it holds the fingerprinting properties

95
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,460
and methods

96
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,580
local runs a document star and it locks

97
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,600
the property SSS with their arguments

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,940
it makes sure that even for dynamic

99
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,699
fingerprinting attribute such as webgl

100
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,360
the generative fingerprinting Hardware

101
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,100
rendered exactly same image as their

102
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Target website does

103
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,860
the extensions then generate and explore

104
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,540
the drugs we call based on the

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,759
fingerprinting process

106
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,800
the code can be used to build a Vision

107
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,080
website to collect users fingerprints

108
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,860
how fingerprints offer extension works

109
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,620
this extension is used to deceive the

110
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,860
website into thinking that the logging

111
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,080
is from a legitimate user

112
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,120
so the extension first takes the

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
victim's fingerprints as input

114
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,000
a post it hooks the fingerprinting apis

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,600
when these apis are accessed the

116
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,479
extension manipulates the return values

117
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,240
of these apis to match the victim's

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,600
values

119
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,039
for automatic Advanced fingerprinting

120
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,740
there is no need to manipulate the

121
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,780
intermediate values

122
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,060
the extension only spoofs the final

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,259
values

124
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,139
for example the canvas fingerprinting

125
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,539
the extension doesn't intercept the

126
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,240
rendering of the canvas image

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,080
the only spoof the two data URL which is

128
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,639
the last step of the canvas

129
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,960
fingerprinting

130
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,300
and similarly for form fingerprinting

131
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,759
the extension only manipulates the

132
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,740
offices and offset height

133
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,780
here is the demo shows the fingerprint

134
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,660
spoofing on my unique website

135
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,240
the left is the victim's device and the

136
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
right is the attacker's device

137
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,800
and these devices are so different we

138
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,020
can see there are many fingerprinting

139
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,440
attributes that have different values

140
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
so once we enable the fingerprint buffer

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,979
extension on the attackers device

142
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,199
this extension spoofs all these

143
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,900
fingerprinting values and it makes the

144
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,900
attackers device look exactly same as

145
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,679
the victim's device

146
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,819
next we want to know how feasible of our

147
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,460
attack in real world cases

148
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,699
we call Alexa top 20 000 websites unlock

149
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,460
fingerprinting apis

150
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,580
we found that top websites use more

151
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,560
advanced fingerprinting techniques on

152
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,440
login Pages than home pages

153
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,259
we'll manually log into 300 popular

154
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,319
websites that support 2fa and use

155
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,860
fingerprint on their login pages

156
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,080
we found that 14 of them use

157
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,800
fingerprints to remember users devices

158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,460
this is more prevalent among high value

159
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,699
Financial Services

160
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,699
and as 2fa become more prevalent we

161
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,160
expect that respect authentication that

162
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,080
use fingerprint will be more common

163
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,220
foreign

164
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,400
next we tested our attack on these 14

165
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,599
websites using our personal accounts

166
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,199
we have two devices the first device is

167
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,419
used to log in these Target websites as

168
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,419
a regular user and the second device is

169
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,639
a different device that never visited

170
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,800
these website before

171
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,380
so we want to see if we can use the

172
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,599
second device to log in these Target

173
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,160
websites without triggering 2fa

174
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,699
as a result we completely bypass 2fa in

175
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,139
nine websites

176
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,419
some websites use finger are basic

177
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,699
fingerprinting and some websites use a

178
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,800
combination of basic and advanced

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
fingerprinting

180
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,200
in our attack successfully spoke all

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,500
these fingerprints

182
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,839
the only reason that the attack is

183
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,380
prevented is the IP registration

184
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,440
even in this case we can still bypass

185
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,080
some of them by modifying the headers

186
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,120
next we want to see if fission websites

187
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,420
are collecting browser fingerprints too

188
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,360
we have three fishing website data sets

189
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,399
the first two data set we have the

190
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,980
source code so will you build a websites

191
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,279
on our local server and the third data

192
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,220
set is more recent so we directly visit

193
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,339
the actual website

194
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,279
we then use visible way a to lock the

195
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,360
JavaScript execution

196
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,560
here are the results

197
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,200
we found that the majority of fishing

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
websites that are running JavaScript

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,839
are also collecting browser fingerprints

200
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,660
and this number is increasing over time

201
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
we didn't look at the official websites

202
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,680
that Target the vulnerable websites we

203
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,339
identify

204
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,320
we followed the number of fishing

205
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,019
websites that Target band a

206
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,720
collect all necessary fingerprints to

207
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,899
bypass 2fa is increasing

208
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,839
which means more and more websites that

209
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,980
try to

210
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,940
steal the user credentials on Bank a are

211
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,580
capable to bypass these Banks to fa

212
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,120
here are the numbers of fishing websites

213
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,920
that Target two different banks

214
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,899
Bambi is now vulnerable because of the

215
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,899
IP registration and we can see there is

216
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,019
a big drop in the bambis number

217
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,040
and band a is vulnerable and a number of

218
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,920
fission websites the target band a is

219
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,180
steadily increasing

220
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
in summary we develop fully automated

221
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
systems for replicating Target website's

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,279
fingerprinting process and replaying

223
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,440
users storing fingerprints

224
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,959
we're presenting an empirical analysis

225
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,480
of the use of browser fingerprinting for

226
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,459
augmenting web authentication in the

227
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,300
world

228
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,700
we demonstrated attacks that completely

229
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,820
bypass 2fa in high value services and

230
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,160
we're presenting a large-scale study on

231
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,839
the use of browser fingerprinting

232
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,480
techniques by Vision websites we discuss

233
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,480
our findings to effective vendors

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,940
thank you for listening and I'm open to

235
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,180
questions
