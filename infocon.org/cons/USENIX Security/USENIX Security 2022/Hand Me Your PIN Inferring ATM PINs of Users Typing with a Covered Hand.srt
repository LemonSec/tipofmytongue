1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,340
uh hi everyone yeah I will talk today

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,299
about attacks on ATM machines and how to

3
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,539
do the attack even if you kind of try to

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,359
protect value type value type your pins

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,640
so you hide with the other hand your

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,140
typing hand

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,019
so why why is why did we consider this

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,660
to be relevant well today ATMs still

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,000
represent the most used system for

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,280
withdrawing cash and for instance in

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
European Central Bank it's reported more

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
than 11 billion cash withdrawals and

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,680
transactions European ATMs in 2019 and

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,899
the number is just growing and growing

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,980
and while the ATMs did let's say do a

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,440
lot of improvements over here actually

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,020
pins personal identification numbers are

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,480
still the most commonly used

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,860
authentication method

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,500
and pin mechanism is of course

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,260
vulnerable to shoulder surfing attack so

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,880
I don't know you have a camera installed

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,560
behind your back or something like that

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,020
and then someone sees when you type your

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,060
pin and then to overcome this problem

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,400
people say well cover your typing hand

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,439
with the other hand and that will make

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,439
the attack Impossible to succeed

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,500
and even the iso standard actually says

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,900
pin digits must not be displayed on the

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,060
screen and the duration of the type of

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,939
feedback sound emitted must be the same

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,560
for each key

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,479
that's why when you when you type your

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,700
PIN you see the fixed symbol like dot or

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,640
star and you will hear most likely a

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,939
sound that is the same for all the pins

38
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,100
so what's the threat model we assumed

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,740
for our work well we've assumed well

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,079
there will be attacker the attacker will

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,600
try to guess the pin from a victim and

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,540
victim will type pins on generic ATMs

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,399
generic keypads

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,159
so we try to make it as realistic as

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,180
possible so the sound the the real

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,399
keypads and of course there will be a

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,200
monitor so that when you are typing the

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
pin you can see everything and of course

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,180
the attacker will have somewhere camera

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,879
positioned and we do not make

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,739
assumptions about the position of the

52
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,260
camera or the type of a camera only that

53
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,080
it records in a visual range

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,020
and what we actually do is a side

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,940
Channel attack where the side Channel

56
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,459
information is the information of your

57
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,340
hand while doing the typing and it's a

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,440
profiling side Channel attack which

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,959
means it consists of two phases so first

60
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,420
phase is the profiling phase or training

61
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,519
phase where you train a model machine

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,099
learning model and second phase is the

63
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,800
attack phase where you use that model to

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,900
hopefully guess the PIN

65
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,660
so how do we do the training well the

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,540
attacker needs to have a replica of ATM

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,940
and the replica does not need to be

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,400
crazy uh faithful copy but should be

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,040
let's say relatively similar and of

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,739
course keypad should be similar

71
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,200
and with that replica of ATM the

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,840
attacker will record many attempts of

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,540
entering pin and then based on those

74
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,700
many attempts of entering the pin we

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
will train a model and later use that

76
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,319
model for the attack

77
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,379
of course there is one kind of Step more

78
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,260
which is the video recording which uh

79
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,019
for us was a bit different because we

80
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,000
really needed to process the video to

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
cut the sequences based on time frames

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,980
and things like that and of course that

83
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,019
all depends how you also place your

84
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,780
camera and so on so on

85
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,659
so for the attack itself what do you

86
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,819
need to do well you need to retrieve the

87
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,700
timestamp from the recorded video and

88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,519
from that you basically do the attack so

89
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,720
we divide the the video into into frames

90
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,080
and basically we attack every digit of a

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,700
pin separately

92
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,260
and

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,599
to to do the attack we consider three

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
possible scenarios so what we call

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,580
single uh pinpad scenario that would be

96
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,040
kind of Ideal setup where you know what

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,620
kind of ATM you want to attack and you

98
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,620
have you bought exact replica of ATM or

99
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,600
at least keypad and you built your own

100
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,699
uh ATM at home

101
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,639
second one is spin pad independent which

102
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,220
is a setup where you do not know the

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,100
exact model of ATM or you want to attack

104
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,320
many different ATMs so you will do

105
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,259
something generic and hope for the best

106
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:37,320
and third one is what we call mixed well

107
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,860
there you know what is the model but you

108
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,900
also say well let's make it a little bit

109
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,840
more generic and add different models to

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,360
to work hopefully later for other attack

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,720
setups and this is just to show you

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,940
differences between keypads so

113
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,160
while you can buy many different keypads

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,020
on eBay or something like that they are

115
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,060
all relatively similar the difference

116
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,400
you can actually notice is the distance

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,180
between the the keys or the height of a

118
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,060
key or the depression needed to press

119
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,880
the key but all in all it looks very

120
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,440
similar

121
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,660
how did we do the data collection well

122
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,000
this was honestly the most important

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,460
part because and most difficult part

124
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,560
because we did it in Corona time and we

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,020
needed participants so it took us a long

126
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,120
time to get all the people

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,419
one per one per day almost in a room to

128
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,940
to get the the measurements we got in

129
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,460
the first setup 40 participants in the

130
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,600
second 18. a male female wasn't the best

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
ratio but it was it was even worse right

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
or left-handed people somehow we managed

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,880
to get only right-handed people

134
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,759
and we asked participants stand in front

135
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,479
of ATM and cover your typing hand like

136
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,240
you usually do and enter a lot of pins

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,940
so we asked each person to enter 100

138
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,180
pins where pin is five digit

139
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,820
and this is just to see the the setup I

140
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,620
can tell you in the picture looks better

141
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,380
than in reality this is actually just a

142
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,840
monitor and then this is a box built

143
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,600
from old table but Dimension wise it's

144
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,479
it's a good representation and the only

145
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,620
really really

146
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,380
part is the keypad like I said we bought

147
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,319
it on on eBay

148
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,259
so just to tell you a bit what we needed

149
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,380
to do for pre-processing we converted

150
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,900
the video to grayscale we normalized the

151
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,300
pixel values we crop the frames by

152
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,120
centering the pin pad and we resize the

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,740
images to to 250 by 250 pixels this is

154
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,660
not so important in the paper you can

155
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,060
see details for other sizes and so on so

156
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,840
on

157
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,180
and we apply the segmentation of each

158
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,880
pin video to obtain subsequences of

159
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,280
frames that correspond to single key

160
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,539
press

161
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,880
what kind of machine learning model did

162
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,120
we use well in the end after a lot of

163
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,340
experiments we settled with uh

164
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,440
convolution neural network and a long

165
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,319
short-term memory and with CNN we

166
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,060
basically do spatial feature extraction

167
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,800
and lstm exploits the features to

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,960
extract temporal patterns and finally at

169
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,720
the end for classification we added MLP

170
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,660
and softmax with 10 units because there

171
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,400
is 10 digits

172
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,160
okay so this is just one example that

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,440
you don't say yeah but people are also

174
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,139
typing pins uh sloppily maybe they don't

175
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,479
cover it properly so on the left side

176
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,060
you see badly covered pin on the right

177
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,520
side you see covered pin of course we do

178
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,340
not do attacks on badly covered pins so

179
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,460
we exclude those from the test set

180
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,539
and here is one example of of the attack

181
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,300
uh figures you can see the well you

182
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,740
don't actually see that's the point of

183
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,500
the attack what is typed and here you

184
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,160
can see predictions the pin was

185
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,740
73633 and actually this is the PIN we

186
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,800
guessed from the second we made well the

187
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,599
machine learning model did a mistake in

188
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,880
the last digit and you can see also by

189
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,220
the probabilities that for the first

190
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,099
digits it was very very confident what

191
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,740
it's doing while the last digit was

192
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,860
between two options was very close but

193
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,680
from the second one it was correct

194
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,660
how does it look like in different

195
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,680
scenarios when we look at accuracy of a

196
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,620
ping gas so you can see that we can get

197
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,940
on a single keypad so single digit

198
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,039
accuracy of more than 80 percent which

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,219
is very well it at least it sounds very

200
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,300
good

201
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,760
of course when you add that to a pin

202
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,279
that is four or five digits the the

203
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,459
accuracy goes down but you can easily go

204
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,620
for four digit PIN to more than 40

205
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,140
percent while that doesn't sound great

206
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,019
it's still four out of 10 pins you are

207
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,300
guessing correctly and why is this

208
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,940
accuracy dropping so dramatically let's

209
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,620
say it like that because people are

210
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,080
doing a lot of strange moments going

211
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
from one digit to another so it's not

212
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,800
like you do the first digit and then

213
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,980
you're a position clearly but there are

214
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,899
many many things people do to make it

215
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,279
faster

216
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,980
okay and then one could also say yeah

217
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,940
but are these results very good or are

218
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,640
they very meaningful in the sense can we

219
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,339
just since we have cameras you can just

220
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,800
have a person looking at the what is

221
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,660
happening and then the person will guess

222
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,779
and we try that also with a user study

223
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,200
so we we asked a bunch of people to look

224
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,820
at videos to

225
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,700
to to try to guess the pins

226
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,240
actually we had two studies one was

227
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,800
uninformed studies so we said people

228
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
look what is happening tell us what

229
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,920
happens second study was like informed

230
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,620
user study where we tried to in uh

231
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,860
inform participants to what do they

232
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,200
should look like uh how they should

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,240
recognize what should be a pin what

234
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,100
should not be a correct pin and so on so

235
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,940
on and result wise you can see amazing

236
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,760
results for human stress and trained

237
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,399
humans so trained humans ended up being

238
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,580
even worse than non-trained humans we

239
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,580
kind of assume this is happening because

240
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,920
uh when we pointed people to what should

241
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,680
look like they were looking too much on

242
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,779
those details and they kind of lost the

243
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,240
bigger perspective but all in all the

244
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,700
the point is

245
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,220
humans accuracy guessing is

246
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,740
a couple of percent while with deep

247
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,140
learning model we can easily get like I

248
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,959
said before 30s 40 percent depending on

249
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,640
the scenario

250
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,120
and to conclude yeah deep learning does

251
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,700
definitely helps guessing the pin even

252
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,579
when the user hides the typing hand and

253
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,860
of course the position of the hand plays

254
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,279
important role and I did not talk about

255
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,040
it but you can find it in the paper uh

256
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,660
there's different kinds of counter

257
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,360
measures you can do but as always there

258
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
is a trade-off the more complicated or

259
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,300
user less friendly countermeasure than

260
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,459
the better defense but of course then

261
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,820
it's less user friendly and surprisingly

262
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,940
humans do seem rather bad at guessing

263
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,700
pins once you cover the typing hand even

264
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,680
if you don't cover it great

265
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,079
that being said thanks and if you have

266
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,579
questions I'm happy to answer
