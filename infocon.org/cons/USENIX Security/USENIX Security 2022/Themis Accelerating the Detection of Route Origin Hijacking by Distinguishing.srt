1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,719
hello everyone I'm Lantern Singh a PhD

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,360
student from qingha University

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm going to make the presentation of

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,340
famous

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,520
accelerating the detection of Route

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,519
origin hijacking by distinguishing

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,239
legitimate and illegitimate moas

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,180
okay

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,059
we're using hijacking is the most common

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,600
type of BJP hijacking it's usually

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
caused by misconfiguration or malicious

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
attacks there are two types of origin

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,579
hijacking they are exact prefix origin

14
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,760
hijacking and the sub prefix origin high

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,260
tech

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,219
in exact prefix written hijacking

17
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,800
hijacker announces the same prefix of

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,640
victim and redirects normal routes in

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,760
sub prefix original hijacking hijacker

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,240
announces a sub prefix of victim which

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,060
can pollute the entire internet

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,540
since more specific prefix is preferred

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,580
in BJP

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,520
origin hijacking usually doesn't last

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,700
long but can cause serious routing and

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,460
security problems such as traffic

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,119
disruption and financial loss in last

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,619
year bgp Mount detected

29
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,100
775 major bgp route hi-teching incidents

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,100
result in less skill Network outages

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,540
existing origin hijacking defense

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,899
mechanisms can be divided into two types

33
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,780
they are proactive prevention and

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,079
reactive detection

35
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,540
proactive prevention mechanism usually

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,720
use cryptography to authorize all

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,079
legitimate origin asses for the prefix

38
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,619
in advance to prevent region hijacking

39
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,220
however these Solutions are fully

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,940
effective only when deployed by Oasis

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,940
which is a long way to go

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,420
therefore many networks prefer to rely

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,959
on reactive detection mechanisms which

44
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,020
monitor BJP updates from BJP monitors

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,260
worldwide and with lamps when detecting

46
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,620
route hijacking

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,580
recent systems such as augers combine

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,000
both culturally analysis and data plane

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,780
probably

50
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,599
on the counter plane they first detect

51
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,900
all multiple original gases Moes

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,780
conflicts based on historical ability

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,120
data MOS is a special phenomenon in bgp

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,720
with multiple es's originate and IP

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,379
address block then they use cheat rules

56
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,280
or pins for each mus conflict and then

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,340
identify original hijackings Based on

58
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,060
data plane visibility information

59
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,819
however most MOS conflicts are

60
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,780
legitimate moas

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,200
legitimate MOS is frequently caused by

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,260
business Corporation IP address transfer

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,580
or DDOS protection however current BJP

64
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,480
hijacking detection mechanisms cannot

65
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,879
effectively distinguish legitimate MOS

66
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,120
from origin hijacking by control plane

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,860
information

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,140
therefore data plane cropping or even

69
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,779
manual verification is still necessary

70
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,299
since legitimate MOS have is much more

71
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,940
frequently than original in reality is

72
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,700
massive legitimate MOS conflicts often

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,280
consume considerable resources for

74
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,739
datably improving and manual

75
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,140
verification which significantly

76
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,199
increase the verification cost and

77
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,139
latency

78
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,899
to adjust this problem we first identify

79
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,259
the potential causes of legitimate mois

80
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,680
and the behavioral features of real

81
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,259
hijacking then we trigger machine

82
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,600
learning classifier to distinguish

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,320
legitimate MOS and origin hijacking

84
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,380
finally we propose a new origin

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,620
hijacking detection system semis to

86
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,100
civil verification cost and the latency

87
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,979
the first build a grand choose data set

88
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,320
including origin hijacking and

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,040
legitimate MOS reconnect origin

90
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,740
hijacking from BJP mode and manually

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,180
validate these events using four filters

92
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,680
for legitimate MOS we collect legitimate

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,400
mus conflicts from ipti but keep only

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,460
those also appear in bgp to avoid

95
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,120
misconfigurations

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,100
based on the ground choose data set we

97
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,800
built we identify six dominant

98
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
characteristics

99
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,180
characteristic 1 exact prefix or sub

100
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,419
prefix Although our purpose is to

101
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,580
distinguish origin hijacking and

102
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,580
legitimate MOS regardless of the

103
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,780
effective prefix we note that exact

104
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,780
legitimate MOS and sub legitimate MOS

105
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,660
are significantly different in some

106
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,020
characteristics

107
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,240
characteristic 2 react difference we

108
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,180
find the overall object difference as

109
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,960
each legitimate MOS is much smaller than

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,039
the other three mus types and 80 of

111
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
exact legitimate MOS conflicts have

112
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
react difference of 0

113
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
is by inspired by the results of work

114
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,820
difference we assume that there must be

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,160
potential business relationships between

116
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,539
asses in legitimate MOS so we measure

117
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,639
the proportion of different business

118
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,639
relationships

119
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,620
as we can see there is a clear

120
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,680
distinction between legitimate MOS and

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,680
the original hijacking in terms of the

122
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,620
proportion of p2c and organizational

123
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,460
relationship

124
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,740
considering victims of origin hijackings

125
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,039
could be located anywhere globally we

126
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,000
focus on three geographical

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,400
relationships they are adjacency same

128
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,120
country and same rir the results show

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,300
that most legitimate MOS conflicts

130
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,720
happen within the same country of the

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
Sim IR

132
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,600
we also note that some hijackers do not

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,240
appear in global routing tables for a

134
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,120
long time before hijacking will estimate

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,539
asses usually announce prefixes in Daily

136
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,419
bgp updates as shown in this figure

137
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,280
let's estimate ass is also almost

138
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,380
continuously announced prefixes while

139
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,440
the overall announcement activity of

140
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,160
real hijackers is much lower

141
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,300
we found that a hijacker May attack

142
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,300
hundreds of victims simultaneously while

143
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,139
a leftimited es is generally present in

144
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,160
limited MOS conflicts we also calculate

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,979
the genetic coefficient of rir

146
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,460
distribution of victims

147
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,819
from our evaluation we observe that

148
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,759
origin hijacking shows a higher genetic

149
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,520
coefficient than ultimate MOS

150
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,660
then we train a machine learning

151
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,240
classifier and the select

152
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,340
26 features that capture the six MOS

153
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,539
characteristics well

154
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,139
the OB accuracy

155
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,479
score from our grand truth is

156
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,380
95.49 we also test mos classifier in

157
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,760
practice it can significantly reduce the

158
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,299
false positive of existing control play

159
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,160
analysis with the recall of

160
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,580
99.2 percent

161
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,100
in the end we propose them is a new

162
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,800
origin hijacking detection system it

163
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,279
combines MOS classifier with existing

164
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,959
detection system

165
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,899
to build a more complete and accurate

166
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,019
prefix ownership database we collect

167
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,279
more information from rpti and irr when

168
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,640
receiving a live bgp update the monitor

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,580
checks whether the prefix and the

170
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,519
original as of the received vgp update

171
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,220
are consistent with local prefix

172
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,320
ownership database

173
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,620
upon receiving MOS conflicts from the

174
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,320
monitor it classifies them into

175
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,560
potential hijackings and legitimate MOS

176
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,399
conflicts using the MOs classifier time

177
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,560
is only needs to probe these potential

178
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,560
hijackings to identify a real origin

179
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,959
hijackings

180
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,959
for those potential hijackings families

181
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,420
use the same data plane and

182
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,760
identification methods as orgas

183
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,100
our evaluation shows that by using the

184
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,339
MOs classifier same is greatly

185
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,380
accelerates the detection of origin

186
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,800
hijacking and achieves almost the same

187
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,740
accuracy as August

188
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,420
thank you for your listening
