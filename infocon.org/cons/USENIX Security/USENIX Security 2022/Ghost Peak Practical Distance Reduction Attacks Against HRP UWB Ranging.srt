2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,500
thanks a lot for the introduction hello

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,259
I'm Giovanni camarati welcome to this

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,480
talk about ghost Peak which is our

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,279
attack against distance measurement

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,460
based on Ultra wideband ranging

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,039
so I would like to talk to thanks all

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,100
co-authors from eth surik and Tio

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,260
darmstadt

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,439
first what can we do with ultra wideband

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,800
well we have two devices for example a

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,840
phone and a car and we want to measure

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,880
the distance between the two we can do

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,800
that by looking at the time it takes for

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,340
a radio packet to travel back and forth

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,680
and we know that the packet travels at

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
the speed of light because we use ultra

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,320
wide vents so very short pulses we can

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,199
achieve a very high accuracy in time and

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,280
therefore in distance

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,800
nowadays the high repetition pulse hrp

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,739
mode of ultra wideband is deployed in

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,159
phones cars and other objects for

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,400
example you can open your BMW car simply

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,020
by keeping your iPhone in your pocket

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,439
and walking close by

27
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,280
so Ultra wideband uh secure ranging is

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,580
useful because it can bind distance with

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,920
identity and this helps in applications

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,740
like access control and mobile payments

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,619
and so on and so forth and if the user

32
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,439
is closed then you can grant access if

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,479
the user is far then you don't Grant

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,320
access in this scenario we care about an

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
attacker that is able to trick the two

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
devices to believe that they are close

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,880
and therefore to have access

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,020
illegitimately this is called the

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,799
distance reduction attack ideally a

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,420
secure engine protocol should be

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,880
provably secure against both logical

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,640
layer and the physical layer attacks

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,759
there are some existing Solutions some

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,920
like those based on signal strength are

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,600
trivially insecure because signal

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,220
strength can be manipulated by an

47
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,739
attacker and some such as the low

48
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,379
repetition pulse mode of ultra wideband

49
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,660
are secure but I will not talk about

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,959
this mode because it's really different

51
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,180
from the high repetition mode we are

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,599
focusing now so what about hrp is it

53
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,220
secure

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,280
let's have a look first at The Logical

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,020
layer so at a logical layer the two

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,239
devices share some cryptographic

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,400
material and then they use this to

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,239
generate a new field the SDS scramble

59
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,280
time sequence at every new ranging

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,340
operation and this field is uh

61
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,260
unpredictable in a cryptographically

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,800
secure way so the attacker cannot start

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,080
transmitting in advance in order to

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,879
shorten the distance so at The Logical

65
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,760
layer hrp is secure

66
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,980
what happens at the physical layer it's

67
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,959
a bit more complex but let's have a look

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,260
step by step so we have a UVB pulse that

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
travels through a channel between the

70
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,459
transmitter and the receiver there is

71
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,680
the shortest path the blue one the one

72
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,480
which represents the distance between

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,980
them which is the one we're interested

74
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,739
in but there are also other copies

75
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,959
arriving from other paths like

76
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,659
Reflections onto objects and then we

77
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,400
don't have one pass but we have multiple

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,260
policies at a high frequency

79
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,920
and all these copies uh arrive at the

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,599
receiver one over the other this is

81
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,180
called interpulse interference now the

82
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,739
receiver wants to recover information

83
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,019
about that blue path that tells the

84
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,340
distance between transmitter and

85
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,400
receiver and it does that by convoluting

86
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,560
the transmitted signal which is known

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,080
with the received signal to recover the

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,540
channel itself and you can see here that

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,180
it can see the blue the yellow and the

90
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,000
Green Path but in this operation there

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,099
is also some noise this noise is called

92
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,680
by the interpulse interference it is

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,780
caused by some active artifacts of the

94
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,180
mathematical operations involved so the

95
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,159
receiver first estimates the noise floor

96
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,159
then looks for the highest peak then

97
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,379
goes back in time looking for the

98
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,540
earliest possible Peak and there it

99
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,480
finds the blue path and since this is

100
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,399
the earliest arrival time it also

101
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,160
corresponds to the distance

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,300
now uh in our uh attack we try to break

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,580
this system at the physical layer so we

104
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,020
have an attacker which is a standard

105
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,780
device cheap standard in proximity of

106
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,600
one of the devices in range of one of

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,660
the devices actually and this attacker

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,419
reactively injects packet on top of the

109
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,100
legitimate transmission this is not

110
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,960
something that requires high accuracy

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
microsecond accuracy is totally

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,840
acceptable and our attacker doesn't have

113
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,320
no idea about the cryptographic secrets

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,940
so it transmits a different SDS which is

115
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,800
randomly different from the legitimate

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
one the attacker also plays with the

117
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,380
power levels of each field in order to

118
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
maximize is the effect of this wrong SDS

119
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,380
while not causing jamming

120
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,600
so what happens at the physical layer

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,440
under attack is that the injected signal

122
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,560
erases the noise floor and creates some

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,860
Peaks one of one of them might go above

124
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,380
the threshold and be recognized as the

125
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,960
earliest Peak and this is a ghost Peak

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,340
because it doesn't exist it doesn't

127
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,919
correspond to a real path but since it

128
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,560
arrives earlier than the earliest one it

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,080
causes a distance reduction this is just

130
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,639
a model of what happens we don't have

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,740
access to the proprietary

132
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,620
implementations inside the devices

133
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,139
we have tested our attack against the

134
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,240
Apple U1 chip in many devices like

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,300
homepods iPhone Air tags and also when

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,419
the iPhone is interacting with other

137
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,340
proprietary sorry other implementations

138
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,800
like the nxp or the corvo ones we

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
achieved reductions uh of up to 12

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,660
meters with a high success rate please

141
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,360
check the paper for more details

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,639
this is an example of reduction two

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,039
iPhones or 10 meters and we managed to

144
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,560
measure distances down to less than two

145
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,320
meters these are other examples where

146
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,979
you can see an nxp tag at 0 meters even

147
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,199
if it was a date then in the middle you

148
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,360
can see an air tag appearing close to

149
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,460
the iPhone even if it's far away and

150
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,259
finally on homepods starting to play

151
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,720
music even if the iPhone is not close to

152
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,460
it enough

153
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,220
so the root problems are that it's

154
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,380
fundamentally very hard to distinguish

155
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,120
between a legitimate signal which is

156
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,860
arriving with low power but the right

157
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,460
beats in the STS and a fake signal which

158
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,800
contains the wrong SDS at a higher power

159
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,740
and this is worsened by the interpolse

160
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,160
interference in hrp another problem is

161
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,680
that we have at the same time

162
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,000
performance that is find the

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,979
functionality performance find in the

164
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,199
earliest Peak and security that is

165
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,240
validating that this is a real peak not

166
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,639
injected by an attacker and in addition

167
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,560
to this all the algorithms are

168
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,360
proprietary and they're not defined in

169
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,360
the standard and cannot be analyzed so

170
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,660
there is no approvable security not only

171
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,340
in the proprietary implementations but

172
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,160
also in general there is no up to now no

173
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,340
formal uh analysis of the security level

174
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,220
of hrp so we can't say for example given

175
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,199
the length of this DS what is the

176
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,199
success rate of an attacker

177
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,380
uh in the future we want to mitigate

178
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,180
these attacks there are some

179
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,979
possibilities like trying to increase

180
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,319
the thresholds to add some checks to

181
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
test the devices but all these Solutions

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,639
do not solve the root problems and there

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,860
is no way to say how much they make the

184
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,080
attack harder in a formal way so the

185
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,300
real solution is to actually work

186
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,759
towards a new standard where we decouple

187
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,400
the functionality from performance and

188
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,020
we achieve a probable security level

189
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,599
with an open security design combining

190
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,000
the best of the performance of hrp and

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,940
the security of the lrp mode

192
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,259
so

193
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,740
the takeaway is that we have looked at

194
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,120
the devices that use distance

195
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,780
measurements to uh use some Security

196
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,759
application for example Access Control

197
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,860
we have shown the first a practical

198
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,319
attack that tricks them to be closer so

199
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,020
that we can for example get access we do

200
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,819
that by injecting noise on the channel

201
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,840
which generates a fake uh ghost Peak and

202
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,659
reduces the distance

203
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,099
in our threat model we don't need any

204
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,839
cryptographic secret we just need to be

205
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,880
in range of the victims with a standard

206
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
device

207
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,779
uh the root cause is the lack of a

208
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,779
formal security analysis and propriety

209
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,580
implementations of hrp

210
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,220
and finally we have demonstrated our

211
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,440
attack on the U1 chip but we are

212
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,899
actively working on this and we found at

213
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,820
least another commercial implementations

214
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,700
to be very vulnerable and uh most

215
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,860
importantly even if there is a pair of

216
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,899
devices and one of them is secure

217
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,959
attacking one is enough in order to

218
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,060
break the distance measurement for both

219
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,959
of them

220
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,300
so this concludes my talk uh thank you

221
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,459
very much for your attention and if you

222
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,260
have any question I'm I'm here
