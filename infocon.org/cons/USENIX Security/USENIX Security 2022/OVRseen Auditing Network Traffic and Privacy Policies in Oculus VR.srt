00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,639
hi everyone my name is ramadi again

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,980
today I'm presenting our work over scene

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,719
which is a system and framework for

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,760
auditing Network traffic and privacy

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,580
policies in Oculus VR this is join work

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,300
with Julie howsui Janice ho Anastasia

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,519
Shuba and Athena Marco Polo

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,619
virtual reality is a newly emerging

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,080
technology that has great potential and

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,600
wide range of applications from games to

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,700
education and Healthcare and Facebook

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,280
are currently called meta is one big

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,780
proponent of this technology through

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,899
Oculus or into particular The Quest 2

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,879
has set as one of the most popular VR

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,079
headsets

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,140
when we're using the VR headset we are

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,780
using a VR app and we are interacting

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,360
with the VR environment in the app

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,300
for example when we are using the beat

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,860
saber game

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,440
We are following the bit of the music as

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,719
we are tasked to slash the red and blue

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,220
boxes that are appearing in front of us

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,520
using two lightsabers in our hands

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,860
in the real world however the rear

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,960
sensors on the device May collect body

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,420
and motion data on top of other data

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,820
that are probably being collected as

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,860
well such as personally identifiable

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,439
information or pii

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,080
on device ads are also coming they can

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,759
be immersive and use sensory and

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,220
Biometrics info further we don't know

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,740
exactly what data are being collected by

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,439
whom and for what purposes

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,259
and so VR is the next big thing but its

39
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,180
privacy implications are not well

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,200
understood yet

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,579
the resource Community has been looking

42
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,159
into privacy in various Platforms in

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,479
particular there have been Works

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,280
including our own works

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,439
that look into tracking and data

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,500
collection in various Edge devices by

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,880
looking into the network traffic to

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,320
understand what data types are being

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,720
sent to which destinations

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,299
for privacy in VR there have been works

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,579
on user study and body motion data

52
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,960
analysis

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,000
and our work over scene which I'm

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,220
presenting today is the first work on

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,720
auditing Network traffic and privacy

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,000
policies in VR

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,580
at the systems level multiple apps can

58
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,099
run on a platform and together they send

59
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,680
data in the network traffic to various

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,300
destinations

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,879
meanwhile and the Privacy policies of

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,060
apps and platform

63
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,860
they describe the data collection

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,739
practices estimated by Privacy Law such

65
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,140
as the gdpr and CCPA

66
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,900
in the context of our work auditing

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,519
means checking the consistency between

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
the data collection practices that are

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,260
actual in the network traffic and the

70
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,940
declared practices in the Privacy

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,200
policies

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,720
to enable this we adopt an existing

73
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,099
framework that's called contextual

74
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,019
integrity

75
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,760
that is meant to assess the

76
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,440
appropriateness of information flow

77
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,900
according to its transmission principle

78
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,959
information flow consists of sender data

79
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,900
type recipient and subject Center can be

80
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,720
the Apple platform data type can be pii

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,879
recipient can be first or third-party

82
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,040
destination and subject is typically the

83
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
user as a data owner

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,940
transmission principle is basically the

85
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,040
context for the flow which can be the

86
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,599
purpose of data collection and other

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,659
contexts such as notice and consent

88
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,260
together these elements form a tuple

89
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,180
in this work we focus on these four

90
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,200
elements as we exclude the subject

91
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,019
which is typically the user and we focus

92
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,400
on the purpose as a transmission

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,019
principle

94
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,060
so suppose we wanted to audit the

95
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,379
beatsaber app

96
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,959
and we could extract the Tuple elements

97
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,900
from the network traffic we call this on

98
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,019
a network traffic side as data flow in

99
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,260
this example the data flow consists of

100
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,840
beatsaber as a sender user IDs data type

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,420
beat games as a first party destination

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,120
as a recipient and so we infer that the

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,860
purpose of the flow is most likely for

104
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,360
functionality

105
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,400
suppose we could also find a

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,200
corresponding collection statement and a

107
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,180
Beat Savers privacy policy

108
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,340
and we could extract the same Tuple

109
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,978
elements in this example we can see that

110
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,839
the Tuple elements extracted from both

111
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,180
sides are consistent

112
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,479
to summarize auditing means examining

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,360
the data flows from the network traffic

114
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,560
analyzing The Collection statements from

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,660
the Privacy policies and checking the

116
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,580
consistency between the two

117
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,460
in VR we enabled this by creating and

118
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,820
using overseeing

119
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,800
so let's take a look into overseeing in

120
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,020
more detail the first part of our scene

121
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,780
is Network traffic analysis we start

122
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,720
with collecting 150 most popular paid

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
and free apps from both app stores

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,699
namely Oculus and side quest as the most

125
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,979
popular third-party App Store

126
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,160
we run each app on Quest 2 headset for

127
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,259
approximately 7 minutes as we interact

128
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,060
with the with the app

129
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,360
meanwhile we use n monitor a VPN based

130
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,340
decryption tool with no rooting to

131
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,040
collect and decrypt the network traffic

132
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,919
we also use Freda to perform certificate

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,440
validation bypass it is an Dynamics

134
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,820
automation tool

135
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,060
to allow the certificate of n monitor to

136
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,100
be trusted by the system as it performs

137
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,300
the decryption

138
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,060
here overseen makes a contribution and

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,039
encryption part the research Community

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,900
is familiar with jvm-based techniques

141
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,940
for Freda in which the validation

142
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,400
function can be found in a simple table

143
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,360
on the jvm stack Trace however on Oculus

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,180
overseen deals with strip binary which

145
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,979
has no symbol table and so it has to

146
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,199
perform binary analysis if you're

147
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,000
interested in more detail please check

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,740
out the paper or you can ask me

149
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,360
questions as well

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,639
upon collecting the network traffic

151
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,160
WE Post process the trace and we extract

152
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,500
data flow which consists of app or

153
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,720
sender data type and destination or

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
recipient

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,639
overall our technique worked on 140 out

156
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,060
of 150 apps we collected close to 8 000

157
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,720
packets which consists of over 6 000 TCP

158
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,039
flows

159
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,919
first we perform data types analysis to

160
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,180
understand what data types are being

161
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,960
sent

162
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
to the destinations

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,020
we found 21 data types that include pii

164
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,180
namely data types that can be linked to

165
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,460
a person fingerprint namely data types

166
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,500
that can be used by trackers to build

167
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,740
user profiles and also VR specific data

168
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,120
types

169
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,759
we also perform ATS or asset tracking

170
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,699
Services analysis to understand the

171
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,319
destinations that are being contacted in

172
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,819
the network traffic

173
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,740
here we found that the top three

174
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,800
destinations include Facebook and Oculus

175
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,020
as platform parties and also Unity as

176
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,880
the most popular third-party Library

177
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,699
used by VR app Developers

178
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,860
so together these analyzes allow us to

179
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,319
extract data flows and the context

180
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,020
the key takeaways here are that Oculus

181
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,080
relative to other similar platforms is a

182
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,240
young ATS ecosystem whose data

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
collection practices include sending 21

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,160
data types to various social or

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,380
analytics tracking domains and during

186
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,240
our experiments we did not find

187
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,060
on-device ads yet

188
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,460
so after we collect the network traffic

189
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,560
we extract the data flows and the Tuple

190
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,660
elements we want to perform a full

191
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,580
auditing by also comparing the data

192
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,900
flows from Network traffic and the

193
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,759
collection statements from the Privacy

194
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,220
policies so the second part of overseen

195
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,280
is privacy policy analysis

196
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,440
in privacy policy analysis we start by

197
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,539
collecting privacy policies from first

198
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,000
parties namely the apps platform parties

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,280
namely Oculus and Facebook and third

200
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,020
parties such as Unity

201
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,419
first we found that many apps namely 27

202
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,180
of them did not provide a privacy policy

203
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,180
when they do we perform automated policy

204
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,979
analysis to check the consistency

205
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,300
between the data flows and the

206
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,280
collection statements

207
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
here overseen makes another main

208
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,319
contribution in the policy analysis part

209
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,300
by integrating state-of-the-art tools

210
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,580
such as polycheck and policies and

211
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,759
adapting them for VR

212
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,620
to understand more how this policy

213
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,319
analysis Works let's take a look at this

214
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,300
example that we have seen before on the

215
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,580
beatsaber app so suppose that we have

216
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,199
collected the network traffic and we

217
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,720
could find a packet structure as shown

218
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,180
on top and a policy text as shown down

219
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,700
below and we wanted to extract the Tuple

220
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,099
elements using polycheck we can check

221
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,539
the consistency of the first three

222
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,839
elements that we can extract from the

223
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,260
packet metadata and payload and also

224
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,120
from the policy text using NLP

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,220
techniques in this example we can see

226
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,720
that the two tuples

227
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,220
they have

228
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,860
exact matches for the elements and so we

229
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,779
consider them as consistent

230
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,600
however overseeing deals with data types

231
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,660
and recipients that can be expressed in

232
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,620
more specific terms in network packets

233
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,940
they can also be expressed in more

234
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,620
generic terms in the privacy policy

235
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,720
texts and so to map these different

236
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,560
terms we rely on ontologies the data

237
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,380
ontology Maps the more generic terms as

238
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,660
found in the Privacy policies into more

239
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,760
specific terms such as the 21 data types

240
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
found in the network traffic

241
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,080
so for example in this Tuple that's

242
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,839
extracted from the privacy policy it

243
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,640
contains technical data as the data type

244
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,920
which is a more generic term

245
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
for device ID so we can map technical

246
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
data into device ID and this Temple

247
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,700
that's extracted from the network

248
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,260
traffic

249
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,560
we consider this as vaguely matching but

250
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,300
they're still consistent

251
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,519
we also rely on entityatology for

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,560
similar purposes for entities

253
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,140
and we created these ontologies based on

254
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,640
the original ontologies created for

255
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,899
Android

256
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,880
upon extracting the data flows and

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,380
collection statements

258
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,000
we can use power check to check the

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,620
consistency between the data flows and

260
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,180
the collection statements

261
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,160
we call this network to policy

262
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,320
consistency analysis

263
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,440
whereas where overseen

264
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,839
determines that the two tuples are

265
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,660
consistent if they exactly are vaguely

266
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,820
match and they're inconsistent other

267
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,140
ways

268
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,959
this figure shows our results

269
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,480
the the numbers represent the numbers of

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,160
data flows whether the data flows are

271
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,200
consistent or inconsistent

272
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,080
we found that 70 of data flows are

273
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,880
inconsistent with their collection

274
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,380
statements in the Privacy policies

275
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,720
mainly for fingerprint and VR sensory

276
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,600
data types upon investigating further we

277
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
found that many privacy policies from

278
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,820
apps did not reference platform and

279
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,279
third-party policies whereas a lot of

280
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
the data flows are being sent to

281
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,339
platform and third-party destinations

282
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,860
and so upon including these privacy

283
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,380
policies from platforms and app for and

284
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,720
third Parties by default we found that

285
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,700
74 percent of data flows became

286
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,839
consistent

287
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,200
so the key takeaways here are that many

288
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
of the developers privacy policies are

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,040
missing if they exist they're poorly

290
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,899
written and they neglect referencing

291
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,899
third-party policies

292
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,360
finally overseen also integrates

293
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,360
policies for purpose extraction by

294
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,820
mapping the sentences that are analyzed

295
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,040
by a polycheck into their corresponding

296
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,980
text segments that are labeled by

297
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,200
policies with purposes

298
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,060
by doing this we can extract the Tuple

299
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,880
elements including the purpose our

300
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,100
results show that close to 70 percent of

301
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,839
the data flows are for non-core

302
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,079
functionality whereas only around 30 of

303
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,360
them are four core functionality

304
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,420
and so I've presented to you overseen

305
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,040
to conclude

306
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,140
I presented to you overseeing a system

307
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,420
and a framework for auditing privacy in

308
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,060
VR from a combined Network traffic and

309
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,800
privacy policy perspective

310
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,959
whose technical contributions include

311
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,660
binary analysis for decryption and the

312
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,160
integration of state-of-the-art tools

313
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
for policy analysis

314
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,660
on an Ever traffic side we found that

315
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,279
the ecosystem

316
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,440
sends 21 data types to various

317
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,480
destinations including VR sensory data

318
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,760
types and Oculus is relatively a young

319
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,740
centralized and afro ecosystem

320
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,019
on the privacy policy side many apps did

321
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,200
not provide a policy 70 of data flows

322
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,300
are inconsistent because a lot of them

323
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,560
did not reference platform and

324
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,959
third-party policies and close to 70 of

325
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,160
data flows are for non-core

326
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,300
functionality

327
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,279
we also responsibly disclosed our

328
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,680
findings to developers in Oculus 24

329
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,380
developers responded mostly with

330
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,360
positive feedback saying that they're in

331
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
need of tools to help them be more

332
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,339
compliant with privacy laws in terms of

333
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,560
data collection practices unfortunately

334
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,000
we do not receive any response from

335
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
Oculus

336
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,420
thank you very much for listening the

337
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,760
code and datasets are available and I'm

338
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,320
happy to take your questions either here

339
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,060
or on slack or through emails
