1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,900
hi everyone my name is Brian katraki and

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,940
on behalf of my co-authors Johnny so and

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,320
Nick naked varakis today I'll be

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,000
presenting our work titled uninvited

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,619
guests analyzing the identity and

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,180
behavior of certificate transparency

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,400
Bots

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,920
so as I'm sure many of you are familiar

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,060
the 2010s were fraught with uh

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,560
certificate Authority compromise

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,859
with incidents such as the Komodo and

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,739
Digi notar hacks resulting in many users

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,540
falling victim to man the middle attacks

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,660
from attackers impersonating trademarks

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,519
such as Google and Microsoft

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,840
these incidents resulted in the creation

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,820
of the certificate transparency system

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,640
which is the so which was created as a

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,440
solution to the problem of TLS

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,079
certificate Miss issuance

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,480
it's simply an append Only log a public

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,660
append Only log of certificate creations

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,640
including the domains associated with

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,979
each certificate

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,600
this allows the public to audit the

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,240
actions of CAS

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,159
and allows trademark owners to identify

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,320
compromise of their own systems by

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,780
observing a certificate creation that

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,060
they did not uh

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,260
put in the request for

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,640
so while the certificate transparency

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,340
system has undoubtedly

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,799
added to the Public's trust in the TLs

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,900
ecosystem

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,520
there has also been unintended

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,140
consequences that we wanted to study in

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,020
this work and that being the fact that

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,979
the adoption of TLS on the web is

40
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,200
constantly growing and the amount of

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
certificate authorities that support

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,939
certificate transparency is also growing

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,920
this has led to certificate transparency

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
turning into a proxy log for all new

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,619
website Creations as they come online

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,720
so in this work we wanted to answer the

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,880
following questions first do web Bots

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,500
monitor CT logs for potential targets

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,300
also do they utilize the fact that

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,420
they're able to observe the domain or

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,340
multiple domains associated with

52
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,920
certificates to Target specific hosts

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,780
based on the content of their domains

54
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,099
and lastly what are their behavior and

55
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,879
are they malicious

56
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,020
so to answer these questions we created

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,760
a system a Honeypot system that we call

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,760
CT pot and it's simply starting from the

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,379
bottom right and moving counterclockwise

60
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,319
it's just a series of measurement nodes

61
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,200
of each hosting an HTTP reverse proxy

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
server that simply just forwards all

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
requests that it receives to a

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,099
centralized database node along with an

65
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,340
SSH telnet and FTP Honeypot

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,519
periodically each of these nodes

67
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,620
registers certificates for pseudo-random

68
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,620
domains

69
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,080
and using the let's encrypt API

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,700
and when let's encrypt receives these

71
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,840
requests

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,959
it will log these certificate Creations

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,599
to one or many certificate transparency

74
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,620
logs

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,260
which will then be ingested by malicious

76
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,239
and benign Bots who will then send

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,980
requests back to our measurement nodes

78
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,379
and this cycle just continues on and on

79
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,780
so as you're probably thinking an

80
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,360
important aspect of this is building

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,099
attractive domains

82
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,480
that allow us to answer the questions

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,519
that we uh

84
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,440
we're seeking to answer

85
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,940
so here's an example of one of the

86
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,440
domains that we used in our experiments

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
so starting from the top most subdomain

88
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,599
we start with a pseudo-random string

89
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,400
that encodes the timestamp of the

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,959
certificate creation so here this is

91
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,879
December 15 2021. so since we have a

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
random aspect to The Domain we know that

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
anyone who visits this domain is not

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,780
simply just guessing that the subdomain

95
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,180
and visiting us randomly they observe

96
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,920
this domain on certificate transparency

97
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,739
next the lowest level subdomain is a

98
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,840
categorical string which represents one

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,540
of three content type groups

100
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,640
so first impersonating strings so these

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,260
are the names of popular trademarks like

102
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,238
apple Facebook and Twitter

103
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,839
allowing us to observe potentially

104
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,220
anti-fishing Bots who are scouring

105
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,720
certificate transparency for

106
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,660
impersonating sites

107
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,060
we also have sensitive strings which are

108
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,340
include strings indicating that there's

109
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,380
a potentially sensitive or vulnerable

110
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,660
service listening at this endpoint like

111
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,780
WP admin let's see

112
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,360
and lastly Baseline strings which just

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,400
allow us to compare the results of the

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,160
first two categories to the Baseline of

115
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,840
of requests that any website will

116
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,580
receive when creating a certificate

117
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,979
and lastly we ensured that our primary

118
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,500
domains were benign and uninteresting

119
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,780
with all possible trademark conflicts

120
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,419
removed by appending the name of a tree

121
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,340
flower and a bird together

122
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,940
um

123
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,979
so that we can concentrate all visitor

124
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,139
attention or bot attention to the middle

125
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,060
subdomain one of the categorical strings

126
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,740
so over the course of a 10-week period

127
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,600
we deployed 12 of these CT pot

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,860
measurement nodes

129
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,100
in total we generated over 4 600 TLS

130
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,680
certificates which resulted in over one

131
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
and a half million HTTP requests from

132
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,440
almost 32 000 unique bot-ip addresses

133
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,840
so looking at the figure on the bottom

134
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,520
you could see that we were comparing the

135
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,740
distributions of visitors who who

136
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,380
visited each of the three uh domain

137
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,199
groups along with visitors who simply

138
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,180
just sent a request to the IP address of

139
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,919
our measurement nodes and what we found

140
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,259
is that there's very very little overlap

141
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,320
between the IP based bots in the yellow

142
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,900
circle and the CT bots in the other

143
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,120
three circles so this means that CT Bots

144
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,539
occupy their own subcategory of all web

145
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,440
Bots

146
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,120
as opposed to

147
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,100
being all in the same group

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
so observing the statistics on the

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,320
requests that we received alarmingly

150
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,479
found that new domains receive requests

151
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,860
from these bots in as little as 12

152
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,139
seconds after certificate creation this

153
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,180
means that any sort of a website

154
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,979
administrator that sets their website up

155
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,780
and creates a certificate should ensure

156
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,699
that all security mechanisms are in

157
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,539
place

158
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,660
before the certificate is created

159
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,580
we also observed diverging Behavior

160
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,319
among the Bots targeting these different

161
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,860
groups so for example Bots targeting

162
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,080
impersonating domains will send a single

163
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,600
request to that domain almost 80 percent

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,180
of the time whereas Bots targeting the

165
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,180
other two groups will send will exhibit

166
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,740
the same behavior in almost 30 percent

167
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,220
of the time

168
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,900
using TLS fingerprinting we were able to

169
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,880
observe that

170
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,800
unsurprisingly these Bots spoof their

171
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,139
user agents so we found that anywhere

172
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,039
from 75 to 85 percent of these Bots

173
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,720
claimed to be a real browser

174
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,660
such as Google Chrome or Firefox but the

175
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,180
underlying TLS fingerprint showed that

176
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,080
their TLS library is a typically a a

177
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,120
scraping Library like the python request

178
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,280
library with a real browser being used

179
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,020
only two to twelve percent of the time

180
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,840
we also observed malicious behavior

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,720
among these pots

182
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,639
alarmingly also with

183
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
the Bots targeting sensitive domains

184
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,599
exhibiting uh

185
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,139
requests to our Network honeypots almost

186
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,840
double uh compared to the other two

187
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,460
groups

188
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,319
and of all three of these groups we

189
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,539
found that over 90 percent attempted

190
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,039
authentication with these honey pots so

191
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,220
these weren't just TCP requests to the

192
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,680
you know Port say Port 22 to see if the

193
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
port was open the Bots actually went

194
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,940
ahead and tried to authenticate with the

195
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,360
Honeypot

196
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,259
so in conclusion we found that web Bots

197
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,539
use CT to discover newly created

198
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,419
websites and we found that they target

199
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,520
these domains based on subdomain content

200
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,780
and exhibit different behaviors

201
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,280
depending on what they're actually

202
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,479
intending to do

203
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,860
we also found that Bots immediately

204
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,839
arrive after certificate creation

205
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,419
meaning again that any website

206
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,640
administrator that is creating a website

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,500
and setting it up should ensure that

208
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,240
they create their certificate as the

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,339
last step of this setup process after

210
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,200
all security mechanisms are in place and

211
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,920
tested thoroughly

212
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,300
we also found that malicious Bots are

213
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
among the overall ctbot population with

214
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,459
many attempting to authenticate with

215
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,399
Services Beyond HTTP servers

216
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,019
we also have a data set available at

217
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,019
uninvited-guests.github.io

218
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,360
and I'd like to thank you for your time

219
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,920
and I'd be happy to take any questions
