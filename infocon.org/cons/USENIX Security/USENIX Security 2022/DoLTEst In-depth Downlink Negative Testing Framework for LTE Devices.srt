1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,740
and I'm PhD student at kaist today I'd

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,740
like to introduce dual tests or downlink

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,500
narrative testing framework for LTE

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,760
devices

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,439
this is the joint work with sangup

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,039
bombsu and yongdae

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,040
LTE is still important and will be

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,940
important for next ears at least and the

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,459
security of Lte is very important

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,020
let me give you a brief background of

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,860
Lte before explaining our problem

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,219
UE your smartphone has two processors on

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,739
application processor which runs mobile

15
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,820
OS such as Android or iOS and a basement

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,280
processor which handles LTE

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,739
communication

18
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,500
it communicates with inode B the base

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,040
station and EPC the core Network and

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
provides cellular services

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,799
there are two main protocols in the

22
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,920
control plane rrc which is for

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,159
communication with enote B and Nas which

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
is for communication with EPC

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,900
the cellular standard organization 3gpp

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,320
has a testing standard called

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,299
conformance specification

28
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,060
unfortunately it mostly deals with

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,720
positive test cases in other words it

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,479
checks if valid messages are correctly

31
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,979
handled

32
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,100
what about negative test cases in other

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,579
words checking if invalid or prohibited

34
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,000
messages or properly handled

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,700
the conformance spec contains only 14

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,200
negative testing cases out of 993 test

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
scenarios

38
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,979
what does it mean

39
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,140
exception handling may not be done

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,119
correctly

41
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,280
however there are multiple challenges

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,800
for doing negative testing

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,220
first how do we enumerate all prohibited

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,160
or invalid messages that are also

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
security critical

46
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,500
second uen networks and different

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,560
messages depending their states

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,080
previous Dynamic testing papers focused

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,739
on stateless cases only

50
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,099
third understanding specification is

51
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,760
difficult therefore making on Oracle in

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,980
other words knowing the correct behavior

53
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,940
is difficult

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,860
to overcome these challenges we design

55
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,180
dual tests

56
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,300
the first step we manually read the

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,360
specification many many times

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,180
through this one-time effort we Define

59
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,120
new security abstracted States and

60
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,400
construct guidelines

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,099
these are our rules for generating test

62
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,980
cases and becomes inputs for the next

63
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,080
step

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,319
in Step 2 using these guidelines we

65
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
generate test cases

66
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,519
we have

67
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
1848 test cases

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,019
then for each device and for each test

69
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,680
case we move the states of EPC in node p

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,920
and phone to particularly required

71
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,800
States and send the test message over

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,540
the air

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,540
we record every behaviors and responses

74
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,519
of the test you is

75
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,000
note that as an initial Oracle we assume

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,060
that a UE should silently draw all the

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,780
test messages

78
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,940
finally for each test results we

79
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,640
analyzed the correct Behavior

80
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,580
we looked up specs and even discussed

81
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,640
with 3gpp people to find a standard

82
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,400
compliant behaviors

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,280
based on them we find we refine our

84
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,159
Oracle and investigate the box and

85
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,239
security implications

86
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,220
uen networks behave differently

87
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,139
depending on message authentication

88
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,120
status of UE

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,060
and the security context is established

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,800
based on the status

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,160
while establishing or LT connection Yuri

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,259
needs to have security context in last

93
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,380
layer firsts and then rrc layer

94
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,660
therefore as you can see in the picture

95
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,960
there are four states

96
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,979
this definition has two advantages first

97
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,919
they can reflect two new attacker models

98
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,960
or men in the middle attacker and a

99
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,180
singular injection attacker

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,060
secondly States in one layer or

101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,880
equivalent in terms of security

102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,460
therefore we may be able to reduce test

103
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,860
cases

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,520
next we generated test messages that are

105
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,820
invalid or prohibited by specification

106
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,360
to do this we searched every statement

107
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,580
related to message authentication from

108
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,699
rrc and nus specifications

109
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,360
then we generated the guideline our rule

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,699
that specifies message types and

111
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,600
contents to generate test cases

112
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,259
these are full guideline regenerated

113
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,020
to address ambiguities in the spec we

114
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,560
over approximated our test messages

115
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,720
specification cannot describe every

116
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,680
details thus we also altered unspecified

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,919
builds in the messages

118
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,500
let me give you an example

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,320
Network can send identity request

120
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,020
message to the device to obtain users

121
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,180
various identities

122
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,419
and the specification says like this

123
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,000
except the messages below no not

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,220
signaling message shall be processed by

125
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,380
the UE unless the network has

126
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,840
established secure exchange of Nas

127
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,979
messages

128
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,539
do you understand what this means

129
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,460
this means multiple things in one

130
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,780
sentence

131
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,900
when No Case established user can only

132
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,620
reply permanent user identity IMG

133
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,440
for other identities you should reply

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,199
only when user has a shared key and

135
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,900
message is authenticated

136
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,380
so in the guideline below we fix message

137
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,259
type as identity requests and choose

138
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,340
every identity parameters except IMG

139
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,620
then we fills out the rest of the fields

140
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,080
as the wild cards

141
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,440
as a result from this guideline we can

142
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,740
get over approximated test cases number

143
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,160
of states times possible security header

144
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,699
types times identity parameter times two

145
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,340
kinds of invalid Max plain and random

146
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,880
Max

147
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,180
so we Implement dual test by modifying

148
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,560
SRS LTE which is open source LT stack

149
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,259
we added about nine thousands of lines

150
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,940
of code

151
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,560
let's figure

152
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,380
is the test setup of the Dual tests

153
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,020
when the test UE is connected it moves

154
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,660
the US state to the Target States and

155
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,240
sends the test messages

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,759
we fully open source the Dual test so

157
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,620
please refer to our Repository

158
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,440
using dual tests we tested 43 solar

159
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,020
devices from five major basebands

160
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,020
manufacturers Qualcomm exynos mediatek

161
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,240
High silicon and Intel

162
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,940
as a result we could find 26

163
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,080
implementation flaws and 22 were new

164
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,300
we just disclosed every implementation

165
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,819
flows to the manufacturers and most of

166
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,520
them are patched

167
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,259
this is the full results of our

168
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,599
experiments and these vulnerabilities

169
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,539
are State dependent as you can see in

170
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:13,740
the paper

171
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,860
for details please refer to our PayPal

172
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,220
paper

173
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,599
here's our findings

174
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,120
we found some interesting manufacturer

175
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,539
dependent flaws 5 nuts integrated bypass

176
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,720
at every Qualcomm basement and two RC

177
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
integrated bypass problem at every

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,159
external space Spence

179
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,640
also there were device specific flaws

180
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,679
such as accepting low Integrity

181
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,799
algorithm eia0 and sending measurement

182
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,860
reports before security activation at

183
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,980
Galaxy S10 with exynos basement

184
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,060
and archa bypass at iPhone 6s with

185
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,920
Qualcomm based paint

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,160
also every mediatek exynos and some

187
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,140
Qualcomm based bands did not check

188
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,080
Integrity for NOS identity request

189
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,399
message

190
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,740
note that these philosor security

191
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,399
critical

192
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
multiple attacks can be launched

193
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,580
exploiting this box

194
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,100
the attacker with no valid cryptographic

195
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,040
keys can change network name and time

196
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,100
inject arbitrary SMS messages with

197
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,540
arbitrary number

198
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,019
If drop or manipulate data traffic or

199
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,600
leak the location of victim

200
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,019
plus we found that deviant behaviors are

201
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,480
also enable the device being of

202
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,320
fingerprinting

203
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,459
at last there were some interesting

204
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,279
experiences during bug reports

205
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,279
we found an old bug reappearing in a new

206
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,120
device

207
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,100
also latest firmware included a new book

208
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,620
finally mediatek were not communicating

209
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,100
well

210
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,640
so we have shown that there are only a

211
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,160
few negative test cases in conformance

212
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,120
specification to test the UE

213
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
we implemented dual test or negative

214
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,980
testing framework and found 26

215
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,560
implementation flaws from 43 test

216
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,060
devices

217
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,880
also we found that new products or even

218
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,360
firmware patching can bring a new box

219
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,180
thus we believe that frequent negative

220
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,180
testing is required to check the logical

221
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,560
box

222
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,339
also we recommend 3gpp to include much

223
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,620
more negative test cases on the

224
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,820
conformance

225
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,160
specification

226
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,300
thank you for listening
