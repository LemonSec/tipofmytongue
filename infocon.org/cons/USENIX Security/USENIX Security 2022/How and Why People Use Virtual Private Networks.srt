[Music]

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,439
suggests our goal was to understand how

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,240
and why people use Virtual private

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
Networks

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,060
today I will give you a brief

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,619
introduction including the motivation

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,660
behind our work

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,520
the methodology we use to answer our

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,020
research questions

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,059
our findings

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,520
and what we have learned from them

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,559
and we will end up traditionally on

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,059
conclusions

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,760
so let's start with the introduction

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,500
so just to make sure we're on the same

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,020
page in theory virtual private networks

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,059
create a secure encrypted connection or

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,340
a tunnel as you can see to a server from

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,379
which user can access destinations on

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,539
the internet so basically it seems that

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,640
the user connects to the internet from

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,399
the VPN server rather than users

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,739
internet service provider

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,780
and there are different kinds of vpns

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,000
which generally can be divided into two

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
groups

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,360
institutional which was actually the

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
first intention for VPN usage these vpns

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,860
are used in certain institutions

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,840
organizations corporations or

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,180
universities they enable users to access

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,280
destinations on private networks like

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,159
private Enterprise or campus networks so

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,439
for example I use globalprotect when

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,180
working from home on traveling and I

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,220
cannot be at the office

39
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,560
on the other hand commercial vpns are

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,180
not used for any particular institution

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,960
those usually commercial vpns especially

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,360
paid ones have different servers in

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,159
different locations for users to choose

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,439
from so for example they can access the

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,259
content that they are interested in

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,540
and some of the most popular vpns among

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,880
our participants were Hotspot Shield and

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,100
nordvpn

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,020
and actually in many cases commercial

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,780
vpns adverse lines themselves as privacy

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,460
tools

52
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,159
however recent studies show that vpns

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,200
can leak trapping and be susceptible to

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
attacks so actually their ability to

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
provide anonymity might be limited

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,099
but two VPN users know about these risks

57
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,520
so this led us to create free research

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,900
questions

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,360
why do people use vpns

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,280
are people aware of the security and

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,860
privacy risks of vpns

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,800
and how do people choose which VPN to

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,540
use

64
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,280
so this takes us to the methodology that

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,780
we used

66
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,959
we conducted a two-part study of 729 U.S

67
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,640
users in total

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,099
in one part of the study we entered 32

69
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,160
student VPN users from one University in

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,720
the US

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,760
12 of them went from the US and 20

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,700
participants were International students

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,700
we also conducted SRV of 349 students

74
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,920
from the same University as the

75
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,739
interviewees and a survey of 348 VPN

76
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,260
users from a general population on

77
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,239
prolific

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,099
as you can see here most students were

79
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,599
from the US and somewhere from other

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
countries

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,900
and almost all of the general population

82
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,599
respondents were Americans

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,400
so let's start with a quick summary of

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,040
our semi-structured interviews

85
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,720
we first designed an interview guide

86
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,040
which included questions about

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
participants General privacy and

88
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,480
security awareness about vpns we asked

89
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,519
participants who they believed could

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,200
collect data about them online to

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,300
describe how adipin Works how they

92
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,099
learned about vpns and what their first

93
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,159
experience using npn was and we also

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,260
asked how they chose and used a

95
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,720
particular VPN and also about likes

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
dislikes and improvements concerning the

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
current vpns

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,980
we use tattoos for coding and this is a

99
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,659
summary of nine main codes that we

100
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,540
report on in our paper which also had 31

101
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,340
child codes reflecting the data's main

102
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,019
teams

103
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,540
and coming back to surveys

104
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,120
based on interview data and Analysis we

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
designed a larger scale study so we

106
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,019
wanted to determine which teams that I

107
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,299
showed you from the interviews held with

108
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,000
a larger sample of users with different

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,519
technological knowledge background and

110
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,459
also access to vpns and as I mentioned

111
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,440
before first we run our study with the

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,940
population of students from the same

113
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,160
University as the interview participant

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,220
and also then the general population on

115
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,979
prolific and to analyze our data we used

116
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,919
qualtrics and R and we also coded

117
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,259
open-ended questions similarly to

118
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,240
interviews

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,460
and now I will talk about our findings

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
um I will actually talk about how our

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,820
participants used vpns what they

122
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,520
believed vpns are and how they selected

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,259
vpns

124
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,740
so let's start with VPN usage category

125
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,000
so we learned that the general

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
population uses vpns more for security

127
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,259
and privacy and tends to use vpns

128
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,600
continually students also valued these

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,340
goals but they actually tended to use

130
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,580
vpns to circumvent access controls

131
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,160
so let's look at the numbers now if you

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,020
look at the table on the left we can see

133
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,820
that most students respondents use the

134
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,759
VPN offered by the university and nearly

135
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,759
have also used free commercial vpns

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,740
and they reported using vpns to access

137
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,900
institutional content and bypassing

138
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,759
censorship

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,520
most general population VPN respondents

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,580
used commercial vpns mostly free ones

141
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,639
paid commercial and institutional vpns

142
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
were less popular

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,020
and they used vpns for privacy and

144
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
security

145
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,699
interestingly as shown in the table here

146
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,440
both groups felt safest using

147
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,419
institutional vpns and not commercial

148
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,580
vpns

149
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,620
and there is a difference between these

150
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,780
two groups and how often they use vpns

151
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,180
so students use vpns sometimes or rarely

152
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,919
While most general population

153
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,020
respondents reported using vpns

154
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,440
sometimes and most of the time

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,360
and now I will talk about mental models

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,220
of vpns

157
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,500
most participants believe vpns collect

158
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,080
data about them as a default consequence

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
of using these tools and primarily for

160
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,539
targeted advertising and and also we

161
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,000
found that our participants had quite

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
pragmatic approach towards VPN so they

163
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,100
knew what they are for but not

164
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,100
necessarily what they do

165
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,259
we actually asked participants to tell

166
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,740
us what the VPN is in their own words so

167
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,479
here are coded responses from our

168
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,520
service suggested that when thinking

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,940
about vpns participants focused as I

170
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,220
mentioned before on the purpose of the

171
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,020
VPN such as location spoofing or

172
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,360
providing extra security and privacy

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,180
over the internet

174
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,919
and we've seen similar pragmatic

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,600
approach in our interview respondents so

176
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
for example participants 25 said it's

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,039
like um I need to see this YouTube video

178
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,600
but they don't let me see it in Brazil

179
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,280
so I'm just going to do it in Belgium I

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,699
think that that's what vpns are to me

181
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,319
so even though general population

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,600
thought about vpns as private secure

183
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,100
connection

184
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,860
they still believed that vpns collect

185
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,720
the data about them

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,060
and students shared that sentiment so

187
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,340
one of our interviewees participant 11

188
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,560
said if you're using vpns for a bit more

189
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
nefarious means I think some of them

190
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,340
dokie blogs and they're able to give

191
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,319
them over to police and the governments

192
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,240
and things like that and then other ones

193
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,800
are a bit more simple like tracking

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
users web habits to sell to advertisers

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,319
and when it comes to subjective feelings

196
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
of our participants to General the

197
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,400
general population as early respondents

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,860
believed that the VPN current team many

199
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,020
things not only access to content but

200
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,419
also privacy safety from tracking and

201
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,280
anonymity

202
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,380
while student respondents generally did

203
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,759
not feel that vpns provided total

204
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,800
anonymity but they definitely guaranteed

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,139
access to content

206
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,120
so let's look at how participants

207
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,099
selected vpns

208
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,919
all participants chose vpns based on

209
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,259
Coast Security and speed and they

210
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,000
learned about vpns around high school

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,979
and college

212
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,660
so here are the numbers

213
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,860
um this figure breaks down with

214
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,479
considerations were important when

215
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,580
choosing between vpns so the general

216
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,199
population respondents considered

217
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,960
security privacy and cost to be

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,879
um important and this is actually

219
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,740
consistent with our other findings that

220
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,599
the general population often describes

221
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,419
VPN functionality in terms of privacy

222
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,139
and security while student respondents

223
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,240
most important considerations were cost

224
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,899
and security as well but also ease of

225
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,719
use so slightly different but both

226
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,419
groups looked at the speed of vpns as

227
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,979
well

228
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,660
and lastly here we can see that our

229
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,580
participants started to use vpns around

230
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,620
high school and college

231
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,080
and so what are the implications of our

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,640
findings

233
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,920
the conflated nature of the term VPN is

234
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
misleading and confusing vpns refer to a

235
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
variety of use cases from improving

236
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,339
privacy to gaining access to restricted

237
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,440
content but they also serve different

238
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,480
functions as they can be institutional

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
and Commercial

240
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,019
and this means that users could benefit

241
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,180
from better resources that would help

242
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,300
them in better understanding of how vpns

243
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,399
work and implications of VPN data

244
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,500
collection so for example potential

245
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,740
tools like a browser extension could

246
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,899
help users understand what data vpns

247
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,000
might collect about them and also what

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
data leaks outside of the VPN

249
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,700
moreover many users selected vpns based

250
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,040
on cost and at the same time they were

251
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,420
concerned about what their vpns

252
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,180
collected and shared data about them

253
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,220
so this finding suggests that some users

254
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,800
might be constrained by cost ultimately

255
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,620
making privacy looks very good so we

256
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,060
strongly believe that strategies for

257
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,660
privacy Equity could be further explored

258
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,459
and another interesting route that could

259
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,500
be taken in the future studies is

260
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,300
actually taking these findings about

261
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,279
user attitudes and awareness about VPN

262
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,899
practices

263
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,660
looking at other privacy enhancing

264
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,940
Technologies including private browsing

265
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,820
mode on common browsers or Tor and see

266
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,560
whether user attitudes and awareness

267
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,820
match or plans translate into those

268
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,640
so to conclude

269
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,440
students mostly use vpns to access

270
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,720
content and when needed while general

271
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,660
population use it more continually and

272
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,180
for privacy and security and our

273
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,339
participants from both groups believe

274
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,120
that vpns can collect data and they had

275
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,019
quite pragmatic approach towards vpns

276
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,000
they chose vpns based on cost security

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,459
and speed and they started to use it

278
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,519
vpns around high school and college

279
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
so thank you so so much for listening

280
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,959
and I also would like to thank Our

281
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,820
Shepherd Katrina chromebold and

282
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,279
reviewers for their feedback

283
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,360
um there are more very interesting

284
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,880
tables figures and information in our

285
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,160
paper so I highly recommend taking a

286
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,560
look at it and if you have any questions

287
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,600
I will be happy to answer them you can

288
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,640
also email me and I will be absolutely

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,620
thrilled to hear from you thank you
