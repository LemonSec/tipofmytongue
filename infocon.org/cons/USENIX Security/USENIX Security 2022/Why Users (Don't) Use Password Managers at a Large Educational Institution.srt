1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,080
welcome to this talk in which I will

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,780
present the work of my colleagues and

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,839
myself about password manager use now

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,300
when we join a new University or any

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,060
other institution we need a lot of

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,300
accounts to get our work done and some

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,859
of these are internal like the

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,260
university account to access email VPN

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,720
and so on and some will be external like

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,719
collaboration services or

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,640
paper submission sites

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,880
usually users receive little support in

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,320
managing all these accounts but what

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,579
would it look like if University

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,280
actually would offer a password manager

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,860
to all its employees

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,780
to securely generate and store these

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,280
passwords

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,379
and that's exactly the situation we

20
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,300
found ourselves in as George Washington

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,520
University

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,660
considers purchasing such an

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,280
institution-wide license for all its

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,420
members

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,459
and we wanted to investigate what the

26
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,600
impact of such an deployment would be

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,119
specifically we formulated four research

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,060
questions for this firstly how aware are

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,820
members of educational institutions

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,619
of password managers and the different

31
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,320
types of password managers that exist

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,380
then how do the current password

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,540
handling strategies of the members of

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,100
these educational institutions look like

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,600
and what is the role of password

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,479
managers currently in these

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,759
then thirdly what are the strategies

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,040
specifically for the University account

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,979
passwords this is very interesting in

40
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,860
this case because the university account

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,460
password would be in the deployment case

42
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,259
promoted to be the Vault password of the

43
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,880
password manager that is the University

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,860
account password will protect all the

45
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,680
passwords in the password manager vault

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,259
and last but not least we wanted to

47
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,240
investigate the reasons for use and

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,979
non-use of password managers in this

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,259
setting

50
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,420
now due to time constraints I can only

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,619
go

52
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,220
um

53
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,500
into the resource of three of these

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,959
research questions but you of course can

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,480
find all the details in the paper

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,020
now to answer our research questions we

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,700
conducted the first large-scale

58
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,099
quantitative measurement study in an

59
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,940
Institutional setting

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,580
we invited 2000 members of the

61
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,200
university to fill out a questionnaire

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,220
by sending invites to a mailing list

63
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,640
and the sample of 2000 members was

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,319
selected by the university survey office

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,319
to be evenly balanced on demographic

66
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,300
lines and institutional roles

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,340
277 of these participants returned and

68
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,680
provided valid data sets

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,980
now for the design of our study we based

70
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,160
this on previous qualitative work by

71
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,680
Pearman and colleagues who did 30

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
interviews about password manager use

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,640
and habits

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,099
they included a definition about

75
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,959
password managers that we also adopted

76
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,519
for our questionnaires where they

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,200
introduced three types of password

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,239
managers that is browser built-in

79
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,459
password managers those in Firefox or

80
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,920
Chrome for example those that are built

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,959
into the operating system like Apple's

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,300
keychain and dedicated third-party

83
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,280
applications

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,099
and we also use the themes they

85
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,280
uncovered in their inductive coding to

86
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,720
design the questions in our

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,220
questionnaire

88
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,379
now the questionnaire itself was

89
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,420
implemented in qualtrics

90
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,920
and it of course started with an

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,840
informed consent and we asked for the

92
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
role of the participant at the

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,260
University

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,940
we then asked questions about the

95
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,260
participants General password management

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,940
strategies and their related behaviors

97
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,220
such as how they synchronize passwords

98
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,379
across devices for example

99
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,420
this also included questions regarding

100
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,000
the three password manager types but

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,319
it's important to note that at this

102
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,480
point the participants had not seen

103
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,379
these introductory texts yet

104
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,480
next we asked about the university

105
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,700
account password

106
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,159
and the strategies used to create

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,680
specifically these passwords and only

108
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,040
then the participants saw the

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,839
introductory text explaining the three

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,060
password manager types and this was

111
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,979
followed by some more questions and we

112
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,500
only included this here to be able to

113
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,940
compare the responses before the

114
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,400
introduction to after the response the

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,960
introduction

116
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,240
to measure the awareness of the

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,699
different password manager types

118
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,699
we then asked the password manager users

119
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,940
among our participants about their

120
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,919
reasons for use and their most as well

121
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,300
as their least liked features about

122
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,479
password managers and the participants

123
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,280
that did not use a password manager we

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,820
asked about their reasons for non-use

125
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,919
and then last but not least in the last

126
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,919
step we had the web skill scale and the

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
sa6 scale as well as the demographics

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,620
questions and participants could opt

129
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,080
into a raffle for one of several ten

130
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,219
dollar gift cards

131
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,660
all right so what did we find

132
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,400
um regarding the participants awareness

133
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,740
of passport managers we found that most

134
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,360
of the participants already knew about

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,660
password managers with only nine percent

136
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,940
um hearing about password managers in

137
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,580
our study for the first time

138
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,660
with 28 the most prevalent medium for by

139
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,639
which participants had heard about

140
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,580
password managers was word of mouth so

141
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,359
from other people

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,060
and a regression analysis we looked at

143
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,440
the factors that might affect

144
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,600
participants awareness and we found that

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,880
increased web skill also increased the

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,660
odds of being aware 1.9 Times by each

147
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,840
one point increase on the scale

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,320
and with 79 also the majority of

149
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,479
participants were aware of the three

150
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,860
different types of password managers

151
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,419
that is they answered consistently

152
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,160
between before and after

153
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,979
um the introductory texts

154
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,320
so in summary most participants actually

155
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,479
were aware of password managers and

156
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,919
participants most frequently learned

157
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,979
about password managers By Word of Mouth

158
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,919
and web skill seems to indicate a higher

159
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,280
awareness

160
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,139
all right so how did the strategies for

161
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,539
the University accounts look like

162
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,360
um first regarding the security we found

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,880
that 83 percent of our participants

164
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,500
believe that the university account

165
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,039
password was at least as secure as

166
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,340
passwords for other accounts they had

167
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,520
the most common reason for choosing the

168
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,139
university account password was

169
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,780
memorability

170
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,800
with 29 the most frequent strategy to

171
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,919
choose this password was actually reuse

172
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,880
now 29 is actually lower

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,460
um than the overall reuse rate we found

174
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,780
among the among our sample but it's

175
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,180
still unfortunate for a password that

176
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,699
would serve as potential wall passwords

177
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,460
so in summary the majority of the

178
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,720
participants rated their University

179
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,500
account password at least as secure as

180
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,360
those of other accounts and most

181
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,039
commonly passwords were chosen from them

182
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,259
for their memorability and the most

183
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,699
frequent strategy was reuse

184
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,860
all right so last but not least I want

185
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,840
to present some results regarding the

186
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,940
reasons for use and non-use

187
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,580
um in this educational setting

188
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,220
in a logistic regression we found that

189
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,620
overall ease of use played the biggest

190
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,080
role when participants agreed that

191
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
password managers are easy to use the

192
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,139
odds of them using one increased by

193
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,099
14.53 times

194
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,199
and less pronounced but still

195
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,180
significant was transparency

196
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,220
when participants agreed that they

197
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,979
understood how password managers work

198
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,560
the odds of them using one increased by

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,460
3.15 times

200
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,120
we also asked the 212th password manager

201
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,039
users among our participants among our

202
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,160
277 participants that their MO what

203
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,479
their most likely least like features

204
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,759
are and these results basically mirror

205
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,120
the regression results

206
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,520
the list of most like features is

207
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,159
exclusively filled with ease of use

208
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,000
features and on the other hand

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,059
security concerns lead the list of least

210
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,779
liked features

211
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,920
now due to the consideration of the

212
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,180
university to purchase this

213
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,760
institution-wide license we also asked

214
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,160
participants How likely they would be to

215
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,779
adopt a password manager if it was

216
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,480
actually offered by the institution

217
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,399
and our results show that the majority

218
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,680
even among the participants that

219
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,820
currently did not use the password

220
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,620
manager

221
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,560
would use one if it was offered by them

222
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,459
the institution

223
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,740
so in summary overall ease of use plays

224
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,240
a very important role in adoption of

225
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,220
password managers as ease of use

226
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,620
features such as autofill

227
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,440
are like the most by password manager

228
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,600
users and even

229
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,839
non-password manager users would adopt

230
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,760
um one if it was offered by the

231
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,180
institution

232
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,580
now as I already said this talk does not

233
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,260
contain all the things that are in the

234
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,120
paper so I would like to encourage

235
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,100
everyone to have a look at it or just

236
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,860
talk to me or my colleagues on slack or

237
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,839
in the brakes

238
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,019
and to conclude this talk I quickly want

239
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,140
to introduce the recommendations for

240
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,760
institutions and developers that we

241
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,100
could derive from our resource

242
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,140
for institutions the most important

243
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,240
message is probably that

244
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,820
if the decision is made to deploy a

245
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,620
password manager

246
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,380
it is likely to find wide adoption

247
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,680
and harnessing Word of Mouth for example

248
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,720
through campaigns involving security

249
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Advocates can be a good way to promote

250
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,320
these campaigns and

251
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,560
Foster trust in the password manager if

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,839
the security decisions of the

253
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,700
institution are already trusted by its

254
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,200
members

255
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
and also institutions should make sure

256
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,820
that the chosen password manager works

257
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,580
for the own websites of the institution

258
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,940
as we have seen autofill

259
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,060
is the most liked feature and so this

260
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,740
should be ensured to work

261
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,620
and for developers the most important

262
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,440
message is that the features should be

263
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,980
easily accessible that means in

264
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,420
particular autofill

265
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,880
by providing browser extension for

266
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,360
example and also password generation can

267
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,180
be promoted if the UI is directly

268
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,420
available

269
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,380
and that's it for the talk thank you for

270
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,480
your time I'd be happy to take your

271
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,660
questions
