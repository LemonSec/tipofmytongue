1
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,760
hi my name is Katarina and I present

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,799
joint work with Claudia Diaz on our

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,260
project warlock verifiable localization

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,380
and decentralized systems

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,460
and

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,740
I will begin the whole presentation with

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,480
a very simple story to give you a

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,180
motivation of what this is about

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,160
in our story we have

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,920
two people we have Ellis and we have a

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,980
good friend Eve and Alice has this super

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,100
special copy of the book 1984 and she

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,719
wants to send it to if

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,660
and he says okay great but please don't

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,399
send it directly to me send it over to

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
socks guy and then he'll hand it over

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,620
and the reason why they go through this

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,239
extra trouble is

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,160
there on the on the way on the

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,039
transmission path there is evil town and

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,860
evil Town doesn't really like books like

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,420
1984.

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,760
and they were just confiscate it so if

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,500
they hand it over to socks guy they have

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,260
this friendly proxy who takes care of

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,479
secure transmission

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,280
problem is

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,700
the attacker impersonated socks guy so

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,439
the attacker acted like it would be

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,360
outside of evil town and would be a nice

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,460
and friendly proxy

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,299
and when Elliston sends the book

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,799
um the attacker can just grab the book

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,720
confiscated and it's gone

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,759
so we don't have a happy ending in our

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,939
story once the guy wins again and we are

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,680
in trouble

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,979
and this is a rather simple and stupid

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,040
story but it actually is related to a

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,040
real world problem so let's look at the

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,079
same story again but now from a more

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,880
technical perspective we have this

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,820
network we have a lot of nodes they are

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,119
connected not everyone with everyone but

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,040
you can reach more or less every node

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,560
with a direct connection no way by

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,540
making one or two hops

48
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,420
and we have Alice and Eve again and they

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,880
are entrusted areas of the network

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,619
and we have this

51
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,440
bad area of the network evil town that

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,300
we don't trust

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,280
so when we make a transmission when

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,560
Ellis wants to reach Eve there are

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,140
different options to to pick a hop for

56
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,840
the transmission you surely would avoid

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,300
any any hop through evil town

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,800
but there are a lot of different

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,900
combinations that you could use that are

60
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,420
trusted so in this case we have our

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,599
proxy socks guy again and we would have

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
a safe transmission

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,840
the problem is

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,180
what about nodes that are not really

65
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,099
where they claim to be so what about

66
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,440
nodes that claim to be in a trusted area

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,840
of the network but actually are in the

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
untrusted one

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,739
that's a problem so we have servers that

70
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,200
lie about their locations and we have a

71
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,599
network that we can't really trust and

72
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,940
that is an actual problem in Real World

73
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,580
Systems

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,860
we want to solve that so we have a

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,780
strict to-do list what we want to

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,980
accomplish

77
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,900
so in the context of this problem

78
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,060
statement we first want to localize

79
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,540
nodes so get that geographical location

80
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,120
preferably with little to no overhead

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,200
for sure

82
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,019
second we want to verify the results so

83
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,659
we want to compare our estimate to what

84
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,580
they claimed so they claimed locations

85
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,900
we want to see

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,360
if something is uh wrong with that and

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,980
we have to prepare for travel here we

88
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,319
have adversaries that will mess with our

89
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,340
system

90
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,500
and third to make things a bit more

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,140
complicated everything should work in a

92
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,120
decentralized setup

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,720
so let's begin with the localization

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,299
that's a rather simple principle so we

95
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,819
have two nodes A and B

96
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,519
and what we can do and we measure the

97
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,099
round trip time between the nodes so we

98
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,519
send a ping from A to B and you wait for

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,440
the response to come back then it takes

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,060
10 milliseconds that's the round trip

101
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,200
time

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,299
and we have to assume a certain speed

103
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,920
for that transmission

104
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,080
and if nothing travels faster than the

105
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,299
speed of light on our internet

106
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,580
this is in a nice upper bound that we

107
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,159
can use it's a terrible overestimate

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,380
what this will do for now

109
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,720
so if you have a simple equation like

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,899
speed times time equals distance

111
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,479
you can just put in all the parameters

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,460
from our measurement you have 10 10

113
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,040
milliseconds of time the speed of light

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,520
this results in roughly 3000 kilometers

115
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,680
and then we can draw the circle around a

116
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,160
and everything inside that circle is the

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,440
area where B could actually be located

118
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,860
and then

119
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,740
this one we can use for localization so

120
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,560
we have a and b we measure the round

121
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,360
trip time we get the distance we draw

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,580
the circle but we don't just do this

123
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,220
once we do it multiple times we add

124
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
another node and another node and you

125
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,160
already see these measurements create a

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,400
lot of circles they all agree in their

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,840
intersection

128
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,139
so this intersection is the area

129
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,720
where B must be located because all the

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,419
measurements agree there

131
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,820
now if you look at our measurements

132
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,280
it's not optimal yet so we have a rather

133
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,400
big area we have b and e in that area so

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,979
what we can do to improve is we just add

135
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,340
more nodes so when we add node Q in our

136
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,160
measurement get a new intersecting

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,680
area and this is where B is supposed to

138
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,479
be located

139
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,340
so this is the approach that we can use

140
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,340
to estimate a Target area it's not exact

141
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,740
localization but we don't need that we

142
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,900
just want to know the country we want to

143
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,560
be sure that our node is not an evil

144
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,360
town but in a trusted area of the

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,740
network

146
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,180
so

147
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,840
step one check we can localize nodes and

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
we have little to no overhead because we

149
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,259
just use ping measurements it's an

150
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,880
existing protocol it doesn't have a lot

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
of overhead you don't need a lot of data

152
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,460
Second Step verify the results so we

153
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,900
have our estimates

154
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,060
now what happens if the attacker just

155
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,720
messes with us

156
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,699
and we look at the same setup of notes

157
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,139
again

158
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,819
but now we have a location of B

159
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,160
that's the the real location and we have

160
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,500
a claimed location the red one

161
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,639
so B claims to be in the red location

162
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,740
but the physical location is the dashed

163
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,039
one so now if we do measurements we

164
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,280
always measure the physical location

165
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,500
obviously we can't just send a ping to a

166
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,240
virtual location

167
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,780
which means the timings we get and the

168
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,600
intersections we get are for the

169
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,100
physical location

170
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,199
and now if you look at this picture you

171
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,900
see that this is nice for the actual

172
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,539
location but it has nothing to do with a

173
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,419
cleaned one so this is a problem right

174
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,220
if you would just look at this you would

175
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,680
say okay something is wrong maybe you

176
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,020
might be an attacker might be very bad

177
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,300
quality of measurements but something is

178
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,860
wrong

179
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,840
so the adverse be smart and says okay I

180
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,819
claim to be here and now I mess with the

181
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,680
measurements because I really want to

182
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,840
make this happen

183
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,240
and the two things that can happen first

184
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,259
thing is

185
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,479
you slow down the measurement this is

186
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,000
easy you can always do that you receive

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,099
a ping measurement you just hold it back

188
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,319
and then you send it back later and all

189
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,060
of a sudden 10 milliseconds became 20

190
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,020
and 20 is a far bigger distance than 10

191
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,580
which means

192
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,919
you can act like you would be further

193
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:47,819
away

194
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,340
than you actually are so this is easy

195
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,099
this is for something between A and B

196
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,039
where the claim location is further away

197
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,919
the problem is speeding up things so you

198
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,860
can't just respond in advance we take

199
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,319
care of that you can't just speed up the

200
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,000
measurement because the speed of light

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,979
is the maximum we already assumed that

202
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,340
so speeding up is a problem and this is

203
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,960
something that allows us to detect

204
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
errors this allows us to see if there

205
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,259
are discrepancies in the measurements if

206
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,940
something is wrong with the claimed

207
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,020
location

208
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,800
and then even if it's just very lousy

209
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,139
measurements we have a low confidence in

210
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,840
our decision and it's a good thing to

211
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,120
double check that

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,200
so

213
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,760
second to do

214
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,958
we can verify the no locations we can

215
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,360
find out if something went wrong either

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,480
measure remains or manipulations in any

217
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,940
case we know we have a low confidence in

218
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,459
the decision and it's something that we

219
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,260
shouldn't just trust

220
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,080
set to do is decentralization so all of

221
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,180
this should work in a setting where the

222
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,399
network is fully decentralized

223
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,279
and I'll spell you the details one

224
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,019
simple solution would be to use a

225
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,180
broadcast channel which means just

226
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,279
upload all the information all the

227
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,360
measurements

228
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,980
then each node can fetch the

229
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,660
measurements and do their own

230
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,540
computations which means every node can

231
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,240
get their own truth than if the majority

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,700
of the network is honest you get an

233
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,600
honest overall result for the evaluation

234
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,700
now

235
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,680
next thing is this this question or this

236
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,899
criticism so this is never going to work

237
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,180
because real networks are really noisy

238
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,779
which means timing measurements are very

239
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,820
inaccurate and you can't relocalize and

240
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,680
then your estimates are wrong and then

241
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,120
you can't really see if something is

242
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
just noisy or a techa or

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,800
whatever happened

244
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,040
so we build the Prototype we build this

245
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,480
whole system

246
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
and a real network with real nodes and

247
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,279
real Transmissions so we use the new

248
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,279
network we had a thousands of nodes we

249
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,440
send timing measurements we gathered all

250
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,080
the data we did our evaluation

251
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,019
turns out localization error in our

252
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,779
prototype on the real internet is 60

253
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,040
kilometers

254
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,680
and 60 kilometers doesn't sound nice if

255
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,839
you think about

256
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,160
navigation for example you shouldn't be

257
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,720
60 kilometers off

258
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,180
but in our case it's just fine

259
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,760
because we're just interested in in

260
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,040
countries for example if a note is in

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,140
the country it claims to be so if it's

262
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,839
in the the country that we trust or in

263
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,339
another country that we don't want to

264
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,899
send our data through

265
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,720
and then 60 kilometers is nice

266
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,360
even in for example Europe where you

267
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,399
have a lot of countries that are rather

268
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,640
small and an error could be a problem

269
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,060
but this is still nice for

270
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,940
finding out what the target area is and

271
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,899
if it's trusted or not

272
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,459
and this brings me to the conclusion of

273
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,300
the talk

274
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,620
we have

275
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,860
a couple of lessons learned from this

276
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,079
system and the problem statement and the

277
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,579
implementation

278
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,260
first of all

279
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,839
we work on a system that's fully

280
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,000
decentralized and where the locations of

281
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,399
nodes really matter where it makes a

282
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,260
difference if you are in country a or in

283
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,640
country B

284
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
we know that nodes can lie so you can

285
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,019
just claim a false location you can just

286
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,700
claim to be in a country that you're not

287
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,140
in

288
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,899
so what we want to do is verify these

289
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,660
claims and find out if someone messed

290
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,180
with the location or the measurements or

291
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,399
if something just went horribly wrong

292
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,680
with the measurements both are things

293
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,140
that we want to find out

294
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,540
so there are three major goals that we

295
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,880
have to achieve first one we have to

296
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,440
localize the notes and for that we use

297
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,779
round trap time measurements that has

298
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,480
very little overhead and we can estimate

299
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
where our node is second we want to

300
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,399
verify the locations

301
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,860
so we want to have robust estimation we

302
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,959
want to compare it and third everything

303
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,600
works in a decentralized setting

304
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
and to show that this actually works we

305
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,220
build a prototype in the Nim Network we

306
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,100
verified the actual locations we had a

307
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,380
location error of 60 kilometers which is

308
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,660
perfectly fine even when you have a very

309
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,180
crowded continent with a lot of smaller

310
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,200
countries

311
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,440
and with this I end my talk and I'm

312
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,240
thankful for your attention
