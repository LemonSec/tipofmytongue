1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,940
and today I will talk about foreign

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,099
intelligence surveillance specifically I

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,839
will describe an open policy problem

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,180
that's been open for many many years and

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,160
how finally we may have a solution

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,740
grounded in cryptography so let's Dive

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,660
In

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,420
so in 2008 the US government realized

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,640
that American companies store data on

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,579
many foreign customers inside the US

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,020
however the government requires a

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,360
warranty usually to access these data so

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,820
a compromise was sought and section 702

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,140
of the foreign intelligence surveillance

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,860
Act was passed section 70702 allows the

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,379
U.S intelligence Community or the IC to

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,239
collect Communications inside the U.S

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,700
when targeting foreigners abroad the

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,280
structure of section 702 has prompted

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,379
significant controversy especially due

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,120
to incidental collection

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,100
while the targets of section 702

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,719
surveillance have to be located outside

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,820
the U.S they often communicate with

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,580
people located inside the IC ends up

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,659
collecting these communications

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,420
incidentally let me explain that with an

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,340
example

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,900
so suppose an element of the

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,600
intelligence Community the NSA serves a

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,820
section 702 directive to email service

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,479
one targeting Mallory email1.com Mallory

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,220
is located outside the U.S and the

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,259
intelligence Community knows this but

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,240
Mallory is communicating with Alice who

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,759
is located inside the U.S Alice uses

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,220
Alice at email2.com

39
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,560
now the IC element knows that Mallory is

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,420
not in the U.S and that their incident

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,100
that they have incidentally collected on

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,740
Alice but they don't know where Alice is

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,600
only email service 2 knows anything

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,280
about Alice's location

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,259
the table illustrates uh what party

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,860
knows what

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
so members of both houses of Congress

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,939
and Civil Society groups have repeatedly

49
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,280
repeatedly asked the IC for an estimate

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,140
almost every year letters to that effect

51
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,060
are sent to the office of the Director

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,680
of National Intelligence the

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,939
intelligence Community maintains that

54
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,380
they cannot estimate incidental

55
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,180
collection without a massive manual

56
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,740
effort and without infringing on

57
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,080
people's privacy in this paper we

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,459
propose a possible way forward

59
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,080
so incidental collection can involve

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,239
either persons located inside the U.S or

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,580
U.S citizens outside the U.S we focus on

62
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,319
the former and only estimate the scale

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,700
of incidental collection affecting

64
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,379
people inside the U.S

65
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,120
as in the previous example service

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
providers may know the location of their

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,620
users many service providers can collect

68
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,599
country level location information for

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
business reasons so they can build a set

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,620
of identifiers like email addresses or

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,540
phone numbers that they believe are used

72
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,120
by persons located inside the U.S

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,519
the IC element similarly can build a set

74
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,080
of identifiers they incidentally

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,680
collected on

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,360
so suppose the IC element holds X naught

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,920
the set of identifiers whose

78
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,239
Communications were incidentally

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,819
collected each service provider holds a

80
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,040
set x i the set of identifiers

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,080
associated with users they believe are

82
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,900
in the U.S the IC element also holds V

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,060
which is a set of associated values

84
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,800
suppose the number of communications

85
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,560
collected per identifier our aim is to

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,080
privately compute the sum of values in V

87
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,379
associated with identifiers in I where I

88
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,120
is the intersection of the IC element

89
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,760
set with the Union of all sets held by

90
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,200
service providers

91
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,480
I is exactly the set of identifiers

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,580
controlled by persons believed to be in

93
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,260
the U.S who were incidentally collected

94
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,980
on

95
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,780
these sets are huge the service

96
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,760
providers may have billions of elements

97
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,040
in their sets and the IC element at

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,940
least will have millions

99
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,459
so here are the ideal functionalities we

100
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,200
term this problem multi-party private

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,239
set intersection with Union and some or

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,540
mpsiu sum in the paper we first extend

103
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,159
the Apple private set intersection

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,920
protocol the Apple PSI protocol to the

105
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,319
multi-party case and then we built an

106
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,180
mpsi protocol out of it and then extend

107
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,360
that result in mpsi protocol into mpsiu

108
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,599
sum in both protocols a delegated party

109
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,180
receives the result in in this case that

110
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,099
would be the IC element which could then

111
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,599
include the estimate in its annual

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,619
transparency reports

113
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,599
um I now describe the threat model so no

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,639
participant of this protocol learns any

115
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,260
new information about the location of a

116
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,560
user associated with an identifier

117
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,120
similarly no service provider learns any

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,919
information about identifiers whose

119
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,000
Communications were incidentally

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
collected

121
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,900
our constructions are secure again such

122
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,000
information is extraction even against a

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,699
malicious IC element or a coalition of

124
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,400
malicious service providers as is the

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,259
case with MPC generally we cannot

126
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,639
prevent participants from intentionally

127
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,620
inducing errors as they can cheat with

128
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,660
their input we also cannot prevent

129
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,220
participants from revealing known

130
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,340
information throughout-of-band channels

131
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,600
and the output of the protocol itself

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,820
May leak information about the service

133
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,100
provider's input sets to the IC element

134
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,259
so in the paper we discuss ways to

135
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,160
mitigate this risk

136
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,660
our method still suffers from

137
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,940
significant limitations we only generate

138
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,500
an estimate of the scale of incidental

139
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,020
collection not a definitive count we

140
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,520
also assume that such an estimate would

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,020
not reveal intelligent sources or

142
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,419
methods as mentioned previously these

143
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,100
estimates do not include U.S persons

144
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,960
located outside the U.S

145
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,000
and we can only count identifiers like

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,440
email addresses and phone numbers but

147
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,520
not people

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,220
the protocol also introduces a

149
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,320
quantifiable risk of false negatives so

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,240
these estimates are always going to be

151
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
lower bounds and with these caveats we

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,080
will now discuss the design of the

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,620
protocols

154
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,360
so we require hash Maps which place a

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,460
value at an index derived from a

156
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,680
cryptographic hash of the value we also

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,479
require hash to Elliptical functionality

158
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,520
so for that we use the current draft of

159
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
the ietf standard which can be modeled

160
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,240
as a random Oracle

161
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,759
as in the Apple PSI system we require

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,560
the diffie-hellman random cell

163
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,199
production so if l t and P are three

164
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,360
elliptic curve points we call them a

165
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,400
decisional diffie-hellman or ddh Tuple

166
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,100
if there is an alpha such that L is

167
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,020
Alpha times G the generator of the group

168
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,780
and P is Alpha times t

169
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,000
and then we Define an operation called

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,479
BH reduction which transforms these ddh

171
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,000
tuples into ddh tupules and non-ddh

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,240
tuples into independent random values

173
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
um also we know that the ddh2 poles in

174
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,600
general have a nice additive property

175
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,100
that we exploit

176
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,580
um in the paper

177
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,419
our construction also requires a

178
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,819
distributed version of the alga mall

179
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,100
crypto system so data encrypted under an

180
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,660
aggregate public key can only be

181
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,300
decrypted jointly by all parties as we

182
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,620
encrypt values in the exponent

183
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,479
description decryption amounts to

184
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,880
Computing discrete logs fortunately we

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,979
only need to decrypt one ciphertext and

186
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,680
we use a combination of CRT and the baby

187
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,660
step giant step algorithm to achieve

188
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,460
that

189
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,139
so the key Insight here is that without

190
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,780
knowledge of alpha ddh tuples cannot be

191
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,240
distinguished efficiently if the ddh

192
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
problem is hard in the group The

193
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,259
delegate the IC element P naught

194
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,720
constructs a hash map that reveals no

195
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,819
information about its input set and then

196
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,740
using that hash map service providers

197
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,960
jointly construct another hash map such

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,300
that Slots of this new hash map hash map

199
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,880
are correspond to the intersection

200
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,020
um corresponding to the intersection

201
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,900
yield ddh values and without knowledge

202
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,699
of alpha other service providers cannot

203
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,919
distinguish which slots correspond to

204
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
the intersection

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,759
um and using R the last service provider

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,039
p n minus 1 constructs an encrypted

207
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,599
array b

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,400
um such that the IC element can only

209
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,740
decrypt elements corresponding to ddh

210
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,259
tuples or in in general corresponding to

211
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,419
the intersection and finally the IC

212
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,919
element receives this array and can

213
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,940
compute the protocol result

214
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,460
so in delegate start the IC element

215
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,639
generates Alpha publishes L which is

216
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,220
Alpha times G this is in some sense a

217
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,139
commitment to Alpha and then for each

218
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,419
identifier in its set the ICL Min Maps

219
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,220
it onto the elliptic curve and

220
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,080
multiplies the elliptical Point by Alpha

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,180
the associated value is also encrypted

222
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,039
and then these two values are stored in

223
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,080
the hash map at an index associated with

224
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,580
the identifier that all service

225
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,319
providers can also compute and then

226
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,240
unfilled slots in this hash map I just

227
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,340
filled with random data

228
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,560
the last service provider encrypts every

229
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,479
slot of this hashmap using a different

230
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,000
key and then Aggregates all ciphertax

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
into an array and shuffles the array the

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
IC element can only decrypt elements

233
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,580
associated with the intersection and the

234
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,199
shuffling ensures that they cannot map

235
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,200
elements back onto the previous hash map

236
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,719
and then for each index in the array the

237
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,700
IC element attempts to decrypt it the

238
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,500
number of successful decryptions is the

239
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,539
size of the intersection and the

240
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,979
decrypted values are Elga miles

241
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,540
ciphertexts encrypted under an

242
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,880
aggregated key then all these algomall

243
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,220
ciphertexts are aggregated summed or

244
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,019
whatever operation you you want to do

245
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,940
and then after this step all parties run

246
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,100
a joint encryption protocol and the IC

247
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,760
element learns the plain text sum

248
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,040
um here is the full mpsiu sum protocol

249
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,640
and variants for mpsi mpsiu and mpsi

250
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,740
some are described in the paper the key

251
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,779
Insight here is that every party sets

252
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,240
slots in hashmap R to definitively be

253
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,700
ddh tuples these slots correspond to

254
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,380
identifiers that they have in their set

255
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,180
other slots which correspond to

256
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,160
identifiers not in their set are

257
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,899
randomized by applying the the

258
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,600
diffie-hellman random self-reduction so

259
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,000
ddh tuples remain ddh tuples and then

260
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,339
non-dds2 pools remain non-ddh tuples

261
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,720
ah computation in general is linear is

262
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,220
linear to the size of the hash map and

263
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,320
also linear in the number of CRT module

264
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,459
I used

265
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,740
uh we Implement and Benchmark our

266
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,640
construction

267
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,019
um even on large sets containing

268
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,000
millions of elements the protocols uh

269
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,680
conclude within a few minutes

270
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
um and our implementation is open source

271
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
and available on GitHub

272
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,860
and as you can see the the false

273
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,540
negative rates are also pretty minimal

274
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,980
in fact they're quantifiable and if you

275
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,899
use a larger hash map you can lower the

276
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,680
error rates

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
um PSI mbsi protocols have been

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,339
constructed from a variety of Primitives

279
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,680
of these only colosnikov provide

280
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
benchmarks for large input sets but

281
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,279
their Protocols are not secure against

282
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,580
collusion when sets are unbalanced in

283
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,440
that the delegate has a much smaller set

284
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,180
our Protocols are faster than password

285
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,300
but increase communication

286
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,720
PSI sum has not been studied extensively

287
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,060
in the multi-party case for large input

288
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,620
sets to the best of our knowledge

289
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,600
intersection with uni with Union in

290
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,980
general has not been formalized before

291
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,339
uh for the multi-party case

292
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,019
and we described many extensions in the

293
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,300
paper I will note a few here we can

294
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,800
prevent collusion between the IC element

295
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,360
and service providers using a simple

296
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,060
extension as mentioned previously adding

297
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,060
noise to the estimate might be valuable

298
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,380
and these protocols can be generalized

299
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,360
using fully homomorphic encryption to

300
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,100
compute arbitrary functions of the

301
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,320
intersection not just the sum and

302
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,640
finally the protocol result can be

303
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,440
computed by an external party with no

304
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
input which is useful for transparency

305
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,339
reporting purposes

306
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,100
but thank you so much and please send

307
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,200
questions to my email address

308
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,279
um and I'll take some questions now
