1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,800
thank you for the introduction uh hello

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,500
everyone good afternoon so uh today I

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,780
will talk about one of our work titled

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,720
off past Network traffic my manipulation

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,260
we are revitalized icmp redirect attacks

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,080
so this is a collaborative work between

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,939
qinghua University George Mason

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,539
University UC Riverside juventum lab and

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,520
Beijing University of post and

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,559
Telecommunications

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,180
so we discover a vulnerability in the

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,260
icmp redirect mechanism which can be

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,719
misused to bypass the legitimate check

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,160
over the SMP iron mechanism and based on

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,480
this uh vulnerability we we just uh

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,719
discover two type attacks one is the

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,360
cell C remote dos attack another one is

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,539
Network traffic hijacking attacks and we

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,939
do experiment to verify the the

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,220
effectiveness of those attacks on the

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,100
real Network and also on the 18 networks

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,799
and we also propose some kind of

23
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,560
measures to to mitigate or defeat those

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,540
attacks

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,640
so first let me give some background

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,360
about this scmp redirect mechanism which

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,740
is defined in the RFC 792

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,700
so in general icmp are redirect allowed

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,939
our Engineers to dynamically update its

30
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,299
routing uh so to in order to optimize

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,540
its forwarding path now suppose in this

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,900
example we have the originator and also

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,759
wants to send a package to the

34
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,020
destination

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,960
and the first

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,240
it will send a package to the default

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,180
gateway and the default gateway will

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,600
forward this packet to the next Gateway

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,500
and in this example the next Gateway

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,140
will keep forwarding this package to the

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,459
destination

42
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,099
so now suppose this are default gateway

43
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,739
find out the originator and the next

44
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,319
Gateway they are in the same network so

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,140
our engineer can directly send this

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,900
package to the next Gateway instead of

47
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,540
first signing to the default gateway so

48
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,599
in this case a default gateway will send

49
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,780
our SMP redirect package to the

50
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,620
originator tell him hey you you can use

51
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,800
an X Gateway as your next hub so when

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,560
this originator received this redirect

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
packet it will first do a legitimacy

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,700
check see okay if this is valid

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,640
package and if it is it will originator

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,519
will update its routing table

57
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,519
so for the future a subsequent package

58
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,280
it will directly use the next Gateway as

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,599
next hub

60
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,060
which continue I will assigning this

61
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,459
package to the destination

62
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,040
so now let's see what type of this

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,739
legitimate check will be performed on

64
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,760
this originator

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,819
so this table shows one uh this icmp

66
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,540
redirect or SMP error message so here

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,640
just SMP redirect is just one type of

68
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,519
SMP Arrow message so this table shows

69
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,120
one example of this SMP error message

70
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,060
and originator when one originator

71
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,640
received this package it will conduct

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,940
two checks first one it will check if

73
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,519
this message was sent by the default

74
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,940
gateway in this example

75
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,299
and we we know actually this could uh be

76
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,659
uh easily spoofed by attacker just by

77
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:55,980
just such

78
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,580
change this uh the source address to

79
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,040
affect the IP address

80
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,760
and a second check actually is related

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,879
to this uh the format of SMP Arrow

82
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,939
typically this SMP error message will

83
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,620
contain at least 28 octet or bats of

84
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,579
original packet which trigger this SMP

85
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,019
error message

86
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,100
so we see here this uh if this

87
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,300
for attacker to uh send this effect or

88
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,360
this effect as the NPR message I need to

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
be able to craft this 28 octet data

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
which can be a successfully verified by

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,380
the originator and accept it

92
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,240
so the basic idea of this our uh the

93
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,580
attack or this availability is actually

94
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,340
we can use this as a stateless protocol

95
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,120
for example UDP which are usually do not

96
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,300
remember data has been signed earlier so

97
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,900
attacker can craft this SNP redirect

98
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,500
package which containing those stateless

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,860
protocol data to invade those uh

100
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,300
legitimate tracks so in case if this is

101
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,360
some Modern OS operating system they may

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,000
perform some simple tracks on this

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,300
existence of the UDP connections

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,479
actually attacker can easily trick this

105
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,139
originator to set up or establish a

106
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,300
connection UDP connection with this

107
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,280
destination

108
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,660
and also

109
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,520
attacker can easily know those

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,680
information about those iotp socket

111
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,280
So based on this one ability uh we can

112
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,580
attacker can craft an invasive SMP

113
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,440
redirect message

114
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,320
and then they saw

115
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,199
a attacker then can conduct uh two types

116
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,139
of attacks one is a Dos denial of

117
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,780
service attack another one is a network

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,900
traffic uh in a hijacking attack

119
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,139
on this dos attack

120
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,259
so there's a off pass attacker which is

121
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,840
not uh in the past between this

122
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,240
originator and the destination actually

123
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,440
it can send out such a malicious SMP

124
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,620
redirect message to cut off this

125
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,780
existing connection between the

126
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,360
originator and the destination

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,600
are in the hijacking attacks attacker

128
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,780
can assign this uh malicious SMP

129
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,240
redirect message so it can become the

130
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,660
next hub to the victim originator so

131
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,060
then it can just manipulate the package

132
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,699
from the originator to the destination

133
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,400
now first look at some details about

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
this remote dos attacks

135
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,880
we will use some simple examples to show

136
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,259
the idea so now suppose we have this uh

137
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,380
a victim originator it could be a web

138
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,340
server audience of water or toward a

139
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,539
relay node

140
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,940
and the destination could be a web

141
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,060
client or this dni server or the next

142
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,139
hub or tour uh really not really node

143
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,620
and the first to to be able to launch

144
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,819
this attack uh attacker will

145
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:36,720
send out a number of this SMP uh Ico

146
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,199
package to the victim Originators

147
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,560
Network to detect some neighboring node

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,860
our neighbor host which resides in the

149
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,440
same network with this victim originator

150
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,560
and then this attacker will impersonate

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,880
the destination to send the ICM

152
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,340
UDP datagram to the victim or engineer

153
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,800
the goal of this doing this second step

154
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,979
is to establish a UDP socket between the

155
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,880
victim originator and the destination

156
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,319
after that these attackers can forge uh

157
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,220
send a forged redirect message

158
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,520
which because this attacker knows those

159
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,800
information about is a UDP socket

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,740
between this originator and destination

161
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,099
so it can control the material the data

162
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,159
in this uh redirect message so it can

163
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,279
pass this legitimacy check in on this

164
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,559
originator

165
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,959
so after that these are victim

166
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,019
originator will redirect

167
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,100
always packaged to the neighbor host

168
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,640
since this labor host is forwarding

169
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
disabled by default for all those

170
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,320
packages done to it it will simply job

171
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,380
it and then for all this package from

172
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,899
the originator to the destination will

173
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,180
be dropped by this neighbor host

174
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,660
so we perform this attack on this Alexa

175
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,360
top 1 million website until we set up a

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,120
six client web client in different

177
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,060
cities different six different locations

178
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,820
we achieve different number of those

179
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,420
available website so in total we

180
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,959
identify more than 43

181
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,500
000 of vulnerable webs website

182
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,380
and also this will be account for this

183
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,580
about 4.3 percent of the total uh web

184
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,120
servers so we figure out okay what are

185
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
reasons for the failures of of our

186
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,540
attack so forth we summarize four major

187
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,899
reasons for the unreachable website or

188
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,560
DNS error those are majorly due to the

189
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,700
censorship of those Gateway ISP are

190
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,940
those are filtering policies or rules

191
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,120
and also the silent Gateway is just for

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,820
the Gateway they don't just respond to

193
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,800
us with their IP address

194
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,279
and also this Gateway may have some

195
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,040
Ingress filtering mechanism or this is

196
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,500
some operating system they are not

197
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,360
vulnerable to because they have a

198
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,360
specific or customized configuration

199
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,959
they are not available to our attacks

200
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,800
so we also extend our attack to add to

201
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,380
other scenarios

202
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,779
including the dnis

203
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,880
resolver and the tour are really really

204
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,260
node so amount is a total number of this

205
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,279
uh

206
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,000
almost 2 million uh DNS resolvers we

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,240
find about 54

208
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,140
000 available uh dni resolvers and also

209
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,680
we found like 186 one of our tour relay

210
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,640
notes from a total like 60

211
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,620
6500 of the store layout

212
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,600
okay next I'll have a talk about is a

213
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,300
network traffic hijacking attacks so

214
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,519
these are a threat model is a little bit

215
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,760
different from this dos attack the OS

216
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,100
attack is will be a totally off off pass

217
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,160
attack this one actually we assume this

218
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,320
attacker will be within the same network

219
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
with the victim Originators

220
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,500
so turn this by sending this SMP

221
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,940
redirect package attacker can become the

222
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,880
next hub of this victim node to forward

223
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
the package to the destination

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,060
so now let's see one example so in a

225
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,720
normal case user will send a query to

226
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,260
the dnsr forwarder which will send this

227
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,380
requiring to the downstream dni server

228
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,579
with the response from this uh a dni

229
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,279
server this dnis forwarder will send it

230
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,100
back to the user so now for the attacker

231
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,100
they can fold a UDP datagram

232
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,920
which the goal is to establish a UDP

233
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,620
socket between the DNS folder and the

234
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,380
end server and next this attacker can

235
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,620
send this forged redirect messages

236
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,079
this can pass the legitimate check on

237
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,920
this DNS folder and then this will be

238
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,800
able to redirect all the traffic to the

239
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,220
attacker so now if a user signed a query

240
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,579
to this folder the folder will send all

241
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,980
the square root to the attacker an

242
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,620
attacker can send out this malicious uh

243
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,100
this response or replies which can

244
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,620
pollute the cnis cache on this DNS

245
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,860
folder and also this will this will be

246
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,260
provided back to the user

247
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,660
so we conduct this attack in our

248
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,060
controlled environment we control these

249
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,079
uh normal user on the DNS folder so our

250
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,880
experiment shows we can successfully

251
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,779
conduct this attacks

252
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,839
so for the content manager we propose a

253
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,480
Quantum measures from three angles first

254
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,860
from Network we can do a network change

255
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,880
this is to block crafted icmp redirects

256
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,240
so nowadays Anonymous about a quarter of

257
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,380
anonymous system allowed us of forged

258
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,680
package leaving their Network so if we

259
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,980
can just enforce this we can mitigate

260
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,380
this attack and the second one is for

261
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,380
protocol change so we can just improve

262
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,200
this legitimate check of this on this

263
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,760
icmp Iris

264
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,639
and also on host change we can just

265
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,519
disable this SMP redirect mechanism

266
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,360
mechanism for stateless protocols

267
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,420
now conclusion uh we uncover our

268
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,279
vulnerability in the legitimate track

269
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,360
mechanism of SMP Aero mechanism and we

270
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,639
show that this can be misused by

271
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,160
attacker to launch uh two type of

272
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,980
attacks and also we propose a content

273
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,040
manager to mitigate those attacks

274
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
uh that's it thank you I'm happy to take

275
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,639
questions thank you
