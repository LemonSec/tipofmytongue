1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,780
thank you for the introduction and good

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,580
afternoon everyone my name is Logan blue

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,440
and today I'm going to talk about some

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
myself and some of my colleagues have

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,039
done Downton University of Florida when

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,980
it comes to detecting dfic audio samples

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,960
so I'm sure a lot of you are aware of

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,840
what a dfic audio sample is in case you

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,800
aren't

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,660
a d fake is a piece of audio that's

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,820
specifically designed to sound like a

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,279
particular victim speaker so for

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,020
instance what you're bound to hear is

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,200
the actual an actual recording of the

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,280
former president Barack Obama

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,820
members of Congress my fellow matters

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,340
the next recording is definitively not

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,660
the former president it was in fact

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,180
generated by a machine but what I do now

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,219
are a very particular set of skills

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,539
so with these two pieces of audio

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,340
demonstrate is that defects have gotten

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,379
really good they've actually gotten so

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,520
good that we've begun to see them

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,500
actually deployed in the wild and use in

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,119
real world attacks

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,040
so this forces to ask the question of

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,360
how can we deal with this how can we

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,640
prevent deep fakes from being a problem

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,680
so many people would immediately go to

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,320
something like uh well let's use

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,939
speaker authentication but

34
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,939
authentication isn't quite right so

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,619
authentication is asking the question of

36
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,140
who is doing the talking that's not the

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,640
question that deep fakes are posing to

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,540
us

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,479
defects are fundamentally asking is this

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,060
speaker even human they're not asking

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,159
who they're asking what is doing the

42
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,200
talking

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,420
so to address that we propose the

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,500
following

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,180
so clearly we all heard those audio

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,520
samples and we know that that the ml

47
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,840
itself is capturing something of the

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,939
audio it's doing a really good job it's

49
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,500
getting the macro acoustic features

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,619
these are the main frequencies the

51
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,000
format frequencies the most important

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,040
frequencies in the voice that tell us

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,780
what's actually happening

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,119
but the question we want to ask is is it

55
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,680
getting all of the important frequencies

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,720
are there pieces that it's missing

57
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,880
you see fluid dynamically speaking our

58
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,580
voices can be generated in Endless ways

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,380
I can build you a system that can make

60
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,840
your exact voice in a million plus a

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,780
million ways right

62
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,760
but it won't be a way that you can do it

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,800
there's certain limitations we face as

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,720
humans that prevent us from doing all

65
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,099
those different ways of generate our

66
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,599
voices

67
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,900
so we make the following hypothesis

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,720
we can apply known techniques from the

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,700
space of fluid dynamics and use that to

70
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,800
extract biological structures from audio

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,220
samples once we do that we have these

72
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,319
biological structures we can compare

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,000
them about what human beings can

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
actually be no human is 20 feet tall

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,080
with a four and a half wide four and a

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
half foot wide throat so we can't make

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,959
certain sounds but fundamentally machine

78
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,120
learning models don't have to play by

79
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,400
those rules they're all math and so they

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,340
don't have a concept of our biology

81
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,680
so before we go too much further along I

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,900
want to give you some background on how

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,640
humans and how deep fakes actually

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,440
generate audio and build a little bit of

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,819
intuition

86
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,400
so human beings create our voices using

87
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,220
our vocal tracks these are a series of

88
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,900
your Anatomy which are things like your

89
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,720
tongues your lips cheeks nasal cavity or

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,220
cavity Etc

91
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,599
we take these

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,459
pieces of anatomy and we move them and

93
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,379
arrange them in such configurations that

94
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,420
we can make certain sounds

95
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,659
by taking those same those those

96
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,280
different arrangements and playing them

97
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,379
multiple times over and combining them

98
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,580
with other arrangements we can form

99
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,159
longer and bigger pieces of audio things

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,720
like Words sentences and eventually

101
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
entire languages

102
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,319
so I said we wanted to build a little

103
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,819
intuition and what the best way to build

104
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,980
intuition at 3 30 in the afternoon

105
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,040
audience participation

106
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,180
so in a moment I'm going to ask you to

107
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,159
say the word who but I want you to focus

108
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,440
on a few things the first of which I

109
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,580
want you to focus on what you're doing

110
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,799
with your mouth where's your jaw where's

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,260
your tongue how are your lips moving

112
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,180
the next thing I want you to do is I

113
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,620
want you to focus on all those things

114
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,599
but I want you to do it specifically on

115
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,819
the ending phoneme of the Lord who that

116
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,819
ooh sound all right so everybody ready

117
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,319
who

118
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,840
if you note we all do the exact same

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,180
thing we all parched our lips we all

120
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,738
lifted our Jaws we all retract our

121
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,839
tongues and that's because the euphonium

122
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,400
is a rounded back uh closed vowel

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,380
it's a it's a rounded vowel because

124
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,639
we're parsing our lips and pulling them

125
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,440
together to form more of an circular

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,020
shape it's a closed vowel because we all

127
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,060
lifted our Jaws to close down the amount

128
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,800
of actual volume within our oral

129
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,820
cavities

130
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,560
it's a back vowel because we're pulling

131
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,699
the tongue further back in the mouth

132
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,680
causing the Restriction closer to her

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,060
throat

134
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,300
so broadly we all ended up with a

135
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,860
cross-sectional area of your Vocal Track

136
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,440
that looks something like that

137
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,360
those are the macro features the fact

138
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,919
that we all rounded our lists the fact

139
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,600
that we all pulled our tongues back

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,300
those are the macro features but if you

141
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,919
happen to have a longer mandible than

142
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
mine or if my tongue doesn't go quite as

143
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
high in my mouth to cause that

144
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,900
constriction those are going to

145
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,940
implement micro features those small

146
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,620
things that the machine learning models

147
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,759
are going to struggle to pick up and

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,800
struggle to parse

149
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,479
so I promise this is the last time I'm

150
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,280
going to ask you to do something but now

151
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,660
for comparison I want you to say the

152
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,580
word has

153
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,919
so has

154
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,080
particularly I want you to focus on the

155
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,880
a right

156
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,580
so when we say has the a sound we're

157
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,320
going to do the exact opposite of what

158
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,240
we did when we made the U sound right

159
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,500
this is a non-rounded open front vowel

160
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,580
it's non-rounded because we're not

161
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,720
pulling our lips together for a more

162
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,220
circular shape we're letting them stay

163
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,400
in oval it's a open vowel because we're

164
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
going to drop our mandibles line for

165
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,759
larger amounts of airflow and a larger

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,460
volume within our oral cavity

167
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,979
additionally it's a front vowel because

168
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,240
our tongues are moving farther forward

169
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,300
in our mouths and any possible

170
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,320
constriction in the Airways happening

171
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,380
closer to the actual mouth itself

172
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,600
so just like before

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,340
we're going to get a cross-section area

174
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,380
that looks something like this now this

175
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,660
is fundamentally different than what we

176
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,120
had before that structural difference

177
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
that's going to tell us those macro

178
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
acoustic features but the fact that

179
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,240
maybe your volume your volumetric area

180
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,100
is a little bigger than mine or maybe

181
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,199
your constriction is a little tighter

182
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,460
than mine those are going to give us

183
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,440
those micro features that we can see in

184
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
the acoustics

185
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
Santa contrast humans let's talk about

186
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,460
deep fakes so defects effectively have

187
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,080
three components that are necessary in

188
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,880
order to recreate audio the first of

189
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,560
which is an encoder this is going to

190
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,180
take our victim speaker the person we

191
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,800
want to sound like it's going to take in

192
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,940
some of their audio and it's going to

193
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,620
extract out the meaningful features of

194
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,380
why they sound the way they do

195
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,300
we call these speaker embeddings and we

196
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,220
pass them to our second component

197
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,900
this component is called a synthesizer

198
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,520
and this model is responsible for taking

199
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
whatever written text we want in this

200
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,600
case the word cat embedding those

201
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,400
speaker embeddings and then outputting

202
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,680
some middle layer representation of the

203
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,060
audio in this case we're going to use a

204
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,500
spectrogram

205
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,780
now we can't listen to a spectrogram so

206
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,460
we need to take that we need to pass it

207
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,960
to a final component which is the

208
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,819
vocoder this vocoder is going to turn it

209
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,020
into a waveform that we can then play

210
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,520
and then listen to

211
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,979
this is how deep fakes are created but

212
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,240
there's something I teasing that before

213
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
that I want you all to recognize no part

214
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,360
of this assembly no Arrangement no

215
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,340
nothing special about these three

216
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,560
components ties back to the fluid

217
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
dynamics we're completely

218
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,500
uh really lost lost on the fact that

219
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,660
those exist and how they behave and how

220
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,180
they tie back to biology and instead

221
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,380
we're just relying on the machine

222
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,840
learning itself to learn all the fluid

223
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
dynamics perfectly every time and if you

224
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,940
think back I said there's Millions

225
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,860
there's endless ways to make your exact

226
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,080
same voice but not all of them are going

227
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,419
to line up with your biology

228
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,160
so okay

229
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
I want to fluid dynamically create your

230
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
voice I want to mimic it in that way so

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
how do we go about doing that well we

232
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,479
take the cross-sectional area of your

233
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,460
vocal tract during a given utterance and

234
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,539
we're going to take a page out of your

235
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,160
high school calculus textbooks and we're

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,180
going to make it something simpler to

237
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,860
use by discretizing it into effectively

238
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,960
a series of tubes instead of being a

239
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
curve it's nice and linear

240
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,220
to model this flow dynamically the part

241
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,560
we care about really care about is the

242
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,060
actual interface between two adjacent

243
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,740
twos this is where all the interesting

244
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,479
things actually happen

245
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,220
at this intersection we have some

246
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,720
positive flow that's moving down your

247
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,819
vocal tract from your throat towards

248
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,919
your mouse your mouth and you're going

249
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,940
to have a negative flow as well that's

250
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,440
moving back from your mouth towards your

251
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,299
throat this is a little counterintuitive

252
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,440
but this happens because there's

253
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,760
pressure gradients and differentials

254
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,679
inside your oral cavity while you're

255
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,779
speaking

256
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,940
conveniently for us though we can sum up

257
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,740
both the relationship between the size

258
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,260
of our two adjacent tubes and all these

259
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,720
positive and negative flows all within

260
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,880
one nicely packed coefficient it's

261
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,500
called reflection coefficient or as we

262
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,959
label here an R coefficient

263
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,060
by analyzing all of our tubes adjacent

264
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,339
to one another at the same time we end

265
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,500
up with a transfer function

266
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,540
now this isn't a piece of math that

267
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,000
we've just made up or derived this has

268
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,360
been around for 40 plus years this is

269
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,519
the same math that allows us to build

270
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,860
things like saxophones and trumpets this

271
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,180
is the same math that lets us get an

272
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,760
idea of how the dinosaurs sounded or

273
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,920
potentially you know return voices to

274
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,120
people who've lost some like famously

275
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,040
Stephen Hawking was actually offered his

276
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,480
voice at one point and didn't want it

277
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,040
but this is the mathematics that

278
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,899
underpins that

279
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,940
now I know some of you may go but wait

280
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,760
this is going from the anatomy to audio

281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,800
we need to go the other direction we

282
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,019
need to go from the audio

283
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,540
back to the anatomy so how do we do that

284
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,220
well simply put we're going to start

285
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,720
with our transfer function and we're

286
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,980
effectively going to use this as a loss

287
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,420
function within our gradient descent

288
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,420
technique so we take an unknown piece of

289
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,339
audio we then pass it through a Fourier

290
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,300
Transformer in order to get the

291
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,899
frequency response of the unknown audio

292
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,000
we then take our transfer function which

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
as we parameterize in our paper a lot

294
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,019
more details there on how all this works

295
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,839
it's a 15th order differential equation

296
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,700
and we use some domain-specific

297
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,779
knowledge in order to make sure that

298
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:10,980
we're right and we're in the right space

299
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,800
for being accurate to humans

300
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,320
we then pass in two distinct tube series

301
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,080
a red and blue R coefficient series now

302
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,640
remember these R coefficients both tell

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
us how it behaves acoustically and how

304
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,399
it also exists in terms of the relative

305
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,540
size of the tubes compared to one

306
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,980
another

307
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,300
we run that through a transfer function

308
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,040
which will give us two output frequency

309
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,740
responses for our red and blue series

310
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,080
reflection coefficient series and we'll

311
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,580
subtract those from the frequency

312
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,980
response we got from the raw audio

313
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,480
we can then use it to calculate two

314
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,459
error terms select the lower the two

315
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,800
error terms and then adjust our

316
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,019
coefficients as necessary we rinse this

317
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,399
we rinse and repeat and keep doing the

318
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,839
process until we eventually get a near

319
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,660
zero loss and at that point we now have

320
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,700
a estimation of what your vocal shark

321
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,700
looked like during this given utterance

322
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,380
so what does it look like it looks like

323
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,660
this equation or this graph here now

324
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,519
this graph here is those same two models

325
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,779
that we showed you earlier just instead

326
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,000
of aligning on Center we're aligning

327
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,620
with the zeros at the bottom so if you

328
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,180
look at the left side and you work to

329
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,680
the right you're moving from your throat

330
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,200
up to your oral cavity As you move along

331
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,140
there's three main uh well there's three

332
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,579
data sets here we have an orange data

333
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,100
set which is our organic training data

334
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,839
we have our blue data set which is our

335
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,180
organic Control Data and then finally we

336
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,040
have our defects in green if you're

337
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
having trouble seeing where the defects

338
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,800
are they're they're down here they're

339
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,839
down at the bottom they're different

340
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,040
if we're gonna take this and we're going

341
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,320
to move it into our concatenated tube

342
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,220
model

343
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,200
what we see here is that our organic

344
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,600
sets look very similar and we can start

345
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,300
to see some patterns here but our defect

346
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,220
sets look nothing like that

347
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,860
instead as we move to the anatomy we can

348
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,660
see with our organic sets that we can

349
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,800
actually pick out portions of the

350
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
anatomy where the tongue is

351
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,220
um where your neophyx is things like

352
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,940
that

353
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,920
but we can't see that with the defects

354
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
instead

355
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,820
down here this is a drinking straw we

356
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,079
have the same diameter and the same

357
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,640
length of what you would have with like

358
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,440
a normal everyday drinking straw

359
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
well people don't sound like that no one

360
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,839
actually talks like that because that is

361
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,760
an impossible vocal tract for us as

362
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,740
humans to create

363
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,720
bringing back to the beginning we've

364
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,820
said that we had macro acoustic features

365
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,899
that the defects were getting right

366
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,700
think back to the auto we played at the

367
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,920
beginning they sounded close because

368
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,140
this drinking straw that it's speaking

369
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,459
through is giving you something that's

370
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,040
close it's adjacent to what we have

371
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,779
but it's missing out on all those finer

372
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,279
details and that's why we don't have

373
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
something as accurately that's actually

374
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,779
accurate to human biology

375
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,720
so briefly to evaluate our overall

376
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,639
detector we ran full sentences so full

377
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,740
organic anti-fake sentences we ran just

378
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,839
under 5000 in total

379
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,139
those 5000 sentences were broken into 12

380
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,720
525 to strength bigram feature pieces

381
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
that means that we had a little more

382
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,360
than uh we had multiple per sentence

383
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,339
so we implemented a simple majority wins

384
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,839
voting scheme in order to determine

385
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,339
whether or not this one was was defect

386
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,260
or whether it was organic and just

387
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,000
briefly to point out that's our decision

388
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,920
threshold in the middle that red line

389
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,480
all of our decisions being pushed to the

390
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,040
edge so we're not just splitting hairs

391
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,079
but instead we're finding demonstrative

392
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,320
meaningful errors that the depicts are

393
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,579
making

394
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,019
overall we were able to achieve a

395
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,660
Precision rate of 99.9 with a recall of

396
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,339
99.5 percent

397
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,160
so briefly to recap remember we started

398
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,779
with fluid dynamics where we went from

399
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,180
the ability to go from the anatomy to

400
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,620
the vocal tract or sorry from the

401
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,200
anatomy to the Acoustics and we turned

402
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
on its head and went backwards and by

403
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
being able to do that we can speak to

404
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
the actual structures that created the

405
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,399
sound and this allows us to

406
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,139
differentiate between organically

407
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,660
generated human created audio in D fake

408
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,519
machine created audio

409
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,779
so this goes back to that question we

410
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,880
originally posed is it a human being

411
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
that's speaking can answer that question

412
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,200
and as it turns out we can measure that

413
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,079
and uh

414
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,079
yeah so just always remember that uh

415
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,519
humans don't talk through drinking

416
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,940
straws but machines do and on that my

417
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,260
name is Logan blue and thank you all for

418
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,579
your attention and I'd love to take any

419
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,839
questions if we have a Time
