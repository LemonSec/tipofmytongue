1
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,019
hello everybody

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,840
my name is Tony chicari and I'm

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,420
currently a senior research engineer in

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,619
Georgia Tech

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,840
today I'm going to present you our

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,320
latest paper which is entitled uh Matt

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,220
iot 2 modest modern High wattage iot

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,400
botnet attacks and defenses this is a

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,340
joint work between Georgia Tech and the

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,180
University of California in Santa Cruz

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,940
so without further Ado let's jump into

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,239
the presentation

13
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,100
foreign

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,020
the first thing that I would like to

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,660
start with my presentation is the term

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,379
manipulation of demand iot or mad iot so

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,100
what is exactly matte iot the term has

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,500
been introduced for the first time

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,800
in usineck security 2018.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,280
and the term refers to an attacker who

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,100
has access to a high wattage iot botnet

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,860
and is trying to take down or cause

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,439
blackout in a power grid

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,479
so high wattage iot devices such as

25
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,580
electric vehicle Chargers electric

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,060
heaters HVAC devices or air purifiers

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,460
can be compromised and controlled

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,680
remotely by attackers

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,100
and an attacker who has access to a

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,020
large number of such iot Bots they can

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,979
turn them on or off simultaneously from

32
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,799
random locations to cause technical

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,140
issues in the power grid which can

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,259
eventually lead to frequency stability

35
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,320
voltage and stability and line overload

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,140
to cause a widespread blackout in the

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,700
entire system

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,600
so here in this presentation I will talk

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,899
about the bulk power grid if we model

40
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,200
the power grid with different nodes and

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,739
edges like a graph

42
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,340
each node represents a very big city or

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,340
a power plant and each node represents

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,959
the transmission lines that are

45
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,459
connecting everything together

46
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,040
so uh we know that large iot botanists

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
can be employed by attackers to attack

48
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,480
the paragraph to take them down but one

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,379
year later another set of authors came

50
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,720
in and presented another paper in using

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,739
security 2019 the title of the paper was

52
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,340
not everything is dark and gloomy and

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,860
the second paper basically argued that

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,400
it is not as easy as it was claimed in

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,040
the first paper uh to take down the

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,220
paragraph with these uh iot botnets

57
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,560
because of the existing protection

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,080
schemes and the grid controllers that

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,300
the previous authors just overlooked in

60
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,940
their simulations so if we launch the

61
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,220
attack randomly from different locations

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,220
or from different nodes

63
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,319
it's not going to be as effective as it

64
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,019
was claimed and it will have very low

65
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,480
entry real success rates such as one

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,720
percent

67
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,220
so studying these two papers uh we

68
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,159
started to also take a look at the

69
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,019
recent natural blackouts that are

70
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,800
happening uh around the world according

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,159
to our analysis we noticed that uh the

72
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,540
current protection and controller

73
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,120
schemes are able to control most of

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,299
their faults in the grid if there's any

75
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,459
technical fault but these technical

76
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,819
Falls are happening in random locations

77
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,140
but by coincidence if this uh

78
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,700
natural events happen in the weak notes

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,200
or weak locations of the paragraph

80
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,360
it can cause to the blackout and disco

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,299
incidence is happening quite rarely

82
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,380
because let's say the operation of the

83
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,858
grid is changing 24 7 and then the

84
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,019
critical nodes of the system are

85
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,440
changing 24 7 as well but by any chance

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,720
if a random event happens in the

87
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,300
critical note it leads to the blackout

88
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,940
so looking at this phenomena we were

89
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,880
thinking can we make a similar situation

90
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,639
where we can cause blackout in the grid

91
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,860
by the help of this uh iot botnets and

92
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,080
the answer to this question is yes we

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,860
can so we can attack on random nodes uh

94
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,440
so instead of attacking the random notes

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,540
that was proposed by the previous

96
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,840
attacks we claim to attack the system

97
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,199
from the weakest notes of the grid and

98
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,139
changing the loads in specific nodes uh

99
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,419
is been proven to be more catastrophic

100
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,180
because we're attacking the weakest

101
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,199
notes as similar to their uh historical

102
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,380
blackheads so we can cause instability

103
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,240
such as frequency and voltage

104
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,180
stabilities but in order for this happen

105
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,120
we need more detailed information about

106
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,160
the grid operation because it is

107
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,400
changing 24 7. and also we need to have

108
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,699
access to a distributed High wattage iot

109
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,520
botnet it needs to be distributed among

110
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,979
all the nodes or all the geographical

111
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,280
locations in the grid right so that

112
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,740
whenever we say we want to

113
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,880
change the system demand in New York or

114
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,159
California we should be able to do that

115
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,500
So based on these explanations the

116
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,800
matter 82 version 2 is expected or is

117
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
executed in two stages

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,479
uh stage one where we act where we

119
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,600
acquire the required data for launching

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,699
this attack such as graph of the grid

121
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,979
which can be obtained offline the

122
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,900
transmission line parameters and the

123
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,720
real-time system operation data meaning

124
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,000
the power consumption and generation at

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,020
different nodes in the in real time and

126
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,759
in the stage two which is the system

127
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,479
analysis stage and this is being done

128
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,199
periodically every 5 to 15 minutes we

129
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,880
find the weakest notes of the system

130
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,100
from the stability perspective and we

131
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,139
launched attack from those weak notes

132
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,380
so how we can obtain the graph of the

133
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,100
grid and line data this can be done uh

134
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,460
by reconnaissance basically because

135
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,120
everything that is doomed to be uh basic

136
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,880
or consistent with uh

137
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,300
security bios security it cannot be

138
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
protected for a long time

139
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,740
in addition to this we could do offline

140
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,419
analysis by by using some semi-automated

141
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,639
ways such as using the satellite

142
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,000
pictures because uh the transmission

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,340
lines of the power grid and also the

144
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,979
power plants the cities everything from

145
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,259
the bulk power good perspective is so

146
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,900
big that you cannot hide there so if you

147
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,539
have access to a satellite picture you

148
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,479
can write your own image processing or

149
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,440
computer vision algorithm to extract the

150
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,500
graph of the grid and the right side

151
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,680
figure in this slide shows an example

152
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,860
open source tool that uh

153
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,979
that the researchers developed to obtain

154
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,560
the graph of the Peru or Chilean power

155
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,639
grid structure

156
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,580
for the real-time system operation uh

157
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,520
the power grid operation data uh we need

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,660
to

159
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,259
get access to those data and by the

160
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,780
system nodes again we mean the cities or

161
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,419
big power plants these kind of things so

162
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,520
this kind of information can be obtained

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,220
from the Independent system operators

164
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,460
website or from a tool called Bloomberg

165
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,580
terminal and we can write our own

166
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,160
crawlers to obtain such data which we

167
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,680
did in our research for example if we're

168
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
targeting the New York power grid we can

169
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,559
just you can just Google New York ISO

170
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,440
you can log into their system uh not

171
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,719
logging just uh navigate to their

172
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,140
website and then look at the real-time

173
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,300
power generation and consumption at

174
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,399
different regions of their system

175
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,580
so in the second stage we obtain the

176
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,920
necessary information and now we want to

177
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,080
determine the weakest notes of the

178
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,240
paragraph to launch the attack

179
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,399
so we can do the mathematical

180
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,800
calculations to rank the system notes

181
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,680
based on the first stability perspective

182
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,860
it is very hard to calculate it in real

183
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,500
time because it has very high

184
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,399
dimensional non-linear equations uh so

185
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,940
from the literature we use two indices

186
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,700
uh that have the approximation methods

187
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,740
index one and index 2 to find the

188
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,080
weakest notes for the numerical

189
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,080
evaluations we cannot do the real world

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,640
implementation because it has

191
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,320
devastating effects so we have only

192
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,080
simulations and we simulated two test

193
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,580
paragraphs I know that 39 nodes and we

194
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,279
comprehensively model the system its

195
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,860
controllers and its protective schemes

196
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,680
so that we have the complete model of

197
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,839
the system according to the first and

198
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,240
second paper that we analyzed at the

199
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,540
beginning of the presentation

200
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,220
so the overall performance of the

201
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,519
attacks uh here we compared the proposed

202
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,740
attack with index 2 the proposed attack

203
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,040
with index one the second paper and the

204
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,140
first paper that we analyzed and the top

205
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,100
figure shows the results for the IEEE 39

206
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,980
node system the below figure shows the

207
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,700
results for the IEEE 9 node system and

208
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,480
if we we have the Precision recall an F1

209
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,300
score and the success rate of the tag

210
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,779
can be presented in the best way but by

211
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,600
the F1 score as we can see in both

212
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,240
figures the F1 store of the proposed

213
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,060
attack specially index 2 is much higher

214
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,180
than the first and second attack that we

215
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,279
presented at the beginning of the

216
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,120
presentation

217
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,420
so we know that right now the new attack

218
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,019
mad iot2 is effective but what we can do

219
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,959
to defend against that so we have some

220
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
countermeasures

221
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,019
um we have data driven country

222
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,079
information so long term uh as you

223
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,339
remember

224
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,680
uh the main reason that we could cause

225
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,560
the blackout is that the data privacy

226
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,019
issue that that the data is available to

227
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,940
the attacker the real-time power grid

228
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,640
operation so if we limit access to this

229
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
data we might be able to protect against

230
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,620
that we can release the delayed version

231
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,140
of the grid operation data and we've

232
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,000
proved that one percent parameter

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,339
estimation error reduce the F1 score by

234
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,839
almost five percent

235
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,060
we could also register the high voltage

236
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,940
iot devices in an online database to

237
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,240
basically monitor the bulk behavior of

238
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,720
them to protect against any such attacks

239
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,060
there's also Hardware driven attacks so

240
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,579
with revisiting the existing protection

241
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,760
schemes we can significantly reduce the

242
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,439
success rate of the attack

243
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,839
so as far as I'm as far as of the

244
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,060
conclusions

245
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,620
we introduced an attack that the

246
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,899
targeted High wattage iot botnet can

247
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,920
cause uh paragut blackouts mad iot2

248
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,560
targets the weakest notes of the grid

249
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,500
we have presented short-term and

250
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,920
long-term counter measures and also the

251
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,720
attack Vector can be studied in other

252
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,660
domains such as the electricity markets

253
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,860
for future studies

254
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,820
thank you for listening to our

255
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,220
presentation and I will hear for your

256
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,240
questions thank you
