1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,080
thank you all for coming my name is Ben

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,599
Burgess today I'll be presenting work we

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,160
did on remote proctoring software called

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,780
watching the Watchers

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,600
so I I'm sure everyone has seen over the

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,220
last 10 years we're starting to see

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,100
rapid adoption of remote learning

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,199
environments and moving away from these

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,539
more traditional in-person environments

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,279
and through this institutions have been

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,260
looking for ways to ensure that they

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,440
have exam exam Integrity in these remote

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,840
environments so we've been seeing more

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,520
and more adoption of remote proctoring

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,980
software and through this we've seen

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,280
tons of articles that come out that

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,600
should say you know students of color

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,160
are getting flagged their teachers

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,920
because testing software can't see them

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,300
along with this General usability

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,520
problems for the student and this is

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,379
really underscored by high how high

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,739
stakes these exams out they're generally

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,680
um kind of the Capstone exam for example

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,120
like the Bio exam which things like that

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,860
that you need to take to actually be

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,159
enter the field

28
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,900
we build our work on examining the

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,360
examiners which looks at the student

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
experience concerns around remote

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,460
proctoring we do a little bit more of a

32
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,420
technical Deep dive into these Suites

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,520
so to start we wanted to see how

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,060
prevalent these exam Suites were so we

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,880
focused on law schools because

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,479
um

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,340
they're generally again high stakes

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,840
exams

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
um where you only have a few of them and

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,659
they account for most of your course

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,640
grade so we went through and we

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
collected usage statistics from the top

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,740
180 ABA accredited law schools and then

44
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,659
we also focused on Bio exam associations

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,759
because you need these to actually enter

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,320
the field as a lawyer so once you finish

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,939
your law school

48
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:51,979
um

49
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,320
law school you go and take the Bio exam

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
that you can become a lawyer we

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,259
collected these through emails calls

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,060
open records requests and scraping

53
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,460
public websites what we found is that

54
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,619
there was three main proctoring Suites

55
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,960
used by law schools exemplify exam for

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,959
Electro and electronic Blue Book there

57
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,400
was some other ones like canvas and my

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,599
law but those were a much smaller

59
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,340
percentage individually

60
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,120
for the Bible exam itself we see again

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,000
three main ones Stand Out exemplify ilg

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,239
exam 360 and exam four

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,739
so the main question that comes from

64
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,660
this is do these software Suites

65
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,220
actually prevent cheating or is it just

66
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,560
all you know security theater

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,160
um

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,020
and what we're going to focus on here is

69
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,239
not as much the motivated adversary and

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,739
the Very experience the adversary as

71
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:38,700
much as just kind of the evil law

72
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,680
student and what they would be able to

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,739
do to bypass the security features

74
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,780
we can break down the security features

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,239
these Suites offer into three main ones

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,700
exam content protection session

77
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,440
monitoring and restriction so this is to

78
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,340
serve as kind of like what a impulse and

79
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,800
proactive would do so monitoring what

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,080
content you can open and kind of

81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,700
restricting that and then providing an

82
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,500
audit log after the fact and then

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,700
finally we'll talk about identity

84
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,379
verification

85
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,180
so in order to do this what we did is we

86
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,940
obtained the binaries for exemplify exam

87
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,459
four electronic blue book and ilg exam

88
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,040
360. we votes engineered these and then

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,360
we took out findings in kind of a

90
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,560
general methodology and we try to

91
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,420
generalize these and we designed an

92
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,159
automated tool from that which will

93
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,140
allow us to hopefully support future

94
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,180
studies where they can build off of our

95
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,980
work

96
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,560
well so if we look at what an evil law

97
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,540
student might do they would want to

98
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,099
potentially get the exam ahead of time

99
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,300
right

100
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,220
um an encryption at West tries to

101
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,599
prevent this because normally what

102
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,860
happens is you'll download your exam

103
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,480
let's say three days or a week ahead of

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
time and it'll just sit on your computer

105
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,780
and then when you go to take the exam

106
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,239
you're given the password for it and

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,099
you're able to open it we see General

108
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,400
wise General pretty good encryption

109
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,959
algorithms being picked here so most of

110
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,480
them are using like AES 256 but the

111
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,220
question from there comes is the system

112
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
around that actually being used securely

113
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,180
and what we find is that that's really

114
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,220
not the case so several of these exam

115
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,400
Suites will use HTTP Connections in

116
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,299
their back end to the server and even if

117
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,319
they're using a secure algorithm it

118
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,280
doesn't really matter if your key

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
derivation process isn't secure and

120
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,779
exemplify in particular uses very few

121
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,940
password derivation iterations so what

122
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,199
this means is if you didn't have a very

123
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,820
long and secure password someone would

124
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
be able to easily Brute Force this

125
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,040
an electronic Blue Book actually uses a

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,520
fixed password salt called kosher and by

127
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,199
having that fixed and so simple you'd be

128
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,600
able to just pre-compute a lot of these

129
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,139
passwords

130
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,440
so now let's talk a little bit about

131
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,900
session monitoring and restriction this

132
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,220
can kind of break down into three main

133
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,600
categories so you have your process

134
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,880
restrictions clipboard restrictions and

135
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,020
then your virtual machine and device

136
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,300
prevention

137
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,440
the virtual machine device prevention

138
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,699
Works to support the process

139
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,199
restrictions and clipboard restrictions

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,060
because if the software suite can't see

141
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
a whole computer then you're not really

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,479
able to do enforce any of those

143
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,400
restrictions so they make an attempt to

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,199
prevent that

145
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,540
so let's see what we found here we see

146
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,699
that almost all of the proximate Suites

147
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,199
Implement some form of virtual machine

148
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,360
detection this normally takes the form

149
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,419
of a block list the same with a virtual

150
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,220
the virtual device detection

151
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,900
what this means is that anything the

152
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,520
developers didn't think of as permitted

153
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,280
which is just insane there so if you

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,259
have a suite they didn't think of you

155
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,419
could run that or if you were able to

156
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,740
change the name you'd also be able to

157
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,600
run that

158
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,340
and then if we look at the process

159
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,440
restrictions we see them change it up a

160
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,180
little bit here where we move to an

161
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,160
allow list for some of them and this is

162
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,780
just a pre-approved list of applications

163
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,300
that they allow you to run and that

164
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,440
seems like it would be a lot better than

165
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,720
a block list but that's again until you

166
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,600
look at how the system works once you do

167
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,860
that you figure out that they're not

168
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,840
checking the digital signatures for any

169
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,139
of the proctoring Suites so or so for

170
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,520
any of the

171
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
um any of the applications so you'd be

172
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,020
able to easily rename applications to

173
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,639
bypass the restrictions that they put in

174
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,820
place

175
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,039
and some people might from a CS backbone

176
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,180
kind of question why do we even care

177
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,500
about the clipboard right like what do

178
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,180
you copy and paste in

179
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,039
um it ends up with law exams a lot of

180
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,560
the answers you normally have based on

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
large Blobs of case law and other things

182
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
so a student can obtain a massive

183
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,100
advantage over everyone else if they're

184
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,979
able to quickly copy and paste this in

185
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,000
um

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,360
but it ends up that you can just get a

187
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,220
USB rubber ducky

188
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,319
um wrote in your essay or whatever case

189
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,020
law you want plug this in during your

190
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,300
exam and it can easily bypass all of the

191
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,520
clipboard management we saw implemented

192
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,259
so this by you don't even have to mess

193
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,419
with virtual machines right

194
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,560
um

195
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,759
and now finally let's talk about

196
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,860
identity verification this is

197
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,199
particularly important because

198
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,699
um okay these Suites are like completely

199
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,259
security theater that's fine but if they

200
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,460
don't have them to use it why do we care

201
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,440
let them use them right but identity

202
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,819
verification is where we can start to

203
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,800
see the main effects on the student and

204
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
the main negative impacts of the

205
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,039
adoption we're seeing around remote

206
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,020
clock doing Suites

207
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,940
we picked the exemplify for this

208
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,919
analysis because they do most of their

209
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,900
verification client side so they want

210
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,400
the facial recognition models in the

211
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
software they do two specific modes one

212
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,500
is initial verification so what this

213
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,199
does is it acts as a gatekeeper so when

214
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,360
you want to try to begin your exam you

215
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,759
have your ID and some trusted picture so

216
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,960
like your student ID or something like

217
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,880
that they can reference and it takes a

218
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,620
picture of you trying to begin the exam

219
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,419
does some comparison operation and

220
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,979
determines whether or not it thinks it's

221
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,479
you and whether or not you can start the

222
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,340
exam and then continuous verification

223
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,039
just works to make sure that if you pass

224
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,020
this initial verification step you're

225
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,639
the one who continues to take the exam

226
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,720
and you don't just have someone

227
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,120
immediately swap out for you

228
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,580
so you think given that this is working

229
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,560
kind of as a gatekeeper right and could

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,699
prevent people from even being able to

231
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,500
take an exam altogether that they would

232
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,759
have picked the best like state of the

233
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,440
out algorithm done extensive testing

234
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,180
make sure it's fair right

235
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,800
well what we found here is they're using

236
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,479
unmodified open source model they just

237
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,919
pulled from GitHub called faceapi.js

238
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,139
along with dweb and this is being used

239
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,520
for all of the verification operations

240
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,620
so in order to discuss how this performs

241
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,440
we need to First have some metrics we

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
can use to talk about what performance

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
means in this context so we're going to

244
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,660
talk about two here one is the false

245
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,240
non-match weight so what this means is

246
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,280
if you had a subsequent image of

247
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,840
yourself would the software think that

248
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,279
that is actually you I would say that's

249
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,740
not you you can't take the exam right go

250
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,479
contact somebody

251
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,339
um and this essentially means the

252
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,080
student is being accused of cheating and

253
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,940
this might not I mean this might may

254
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,320
seem fine okay let's go talk to somebody

255
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
but you have to remember the stakes here

256
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,620
right these people have this is either

257
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,180
at the end of a semester or at the end

258
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,800
of your law school like a law student

259
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,740
care this is like the gatekeeper to

260
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,839
either being able to graduate or being

261
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,640
able to be a lawyer right so they're

262
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,260
already very stressed out and this is

263
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,740
just another another bio

264
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,660
and then we also have false matches so

265
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,760
what this is is if you have a subsequent

266
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,160
image of a separate person would that be

267
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,380
identified as being you

268
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,240
um and this is this judges this acts as

269
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,820
a proxy for whether or not a student

270
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,200
would be able to potentially cheat and

271
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
get away with cheating by having someone

272
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,220
else take the exam for them

273
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,440
so what we find here is that we see

274
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,380
pretty high fnmowers across the board

275
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,500
um 0.66 may seem somewhat low at first

276
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,360
glance but if you think about a thousand

277
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,920
student class this means six people

278
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,860
would likely have difficulty taking the

279
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,100
exam and if you've ever been on a zoom

280
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,140
call like a meat call the images we have

281
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,820
here on the left have controlled

282
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,959
backgrounds that we're testing with

283
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
controlled lighting conditions this is

284
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,320
much better than you would probably see

285
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,700
in the field so that is a very

286
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,760
optimistic fnmo

287
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,959
and when we move out to the in the wild

288
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,180
data set BGG phase two which uses varied

289
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,800
backgrounds and things like that we see

290
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,899
this weighs up to 14 which would be

291
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,580
about 140 students in that thousand

292
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,440
person class

293
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
um additionally if we look at the false

294
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,260
match weight we see that that's around

295
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,600
21

296
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
for the Patrol images which suggests

297
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,380
that even in optimal conditions this is

298
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,880
merely security theater it's not really

299
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,820
providing much actual security to the

300
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,120
process

301
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,040
so now that we've established that this

302
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,980
doesn't really work well overall we can

303
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,740
look more at the fairness question and

304
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,360
see if we're actually seeing bias in

305
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,880
this is it being unfair between people

306
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,620
from different races and things like

307
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,940
that

308
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,899
so to do this we collected data we use

309
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,700
data sets that have racial

310
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,680
classifications in them we understand

311
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,959
that waste is more nuanced and our

312
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,940
labels cue whack Nuance but we were

313
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,440
using the ones from the original data

314
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,459
set

315
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,079
um so we went with that versus trying to

316
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,579
reclassify

317
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,820
what we see here is significant variance

318
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,640
between subjects of different races with

319
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
in some cases for example on BGG Phase 2

320
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,860
Face API had a seven percent difference

321
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,160
so over the Thousand posts in group that

322
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,240
would be 70 students

323
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,360
um and you would expect that given all

324
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,380
the stakes and that they know the

325
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,459
software's gonna be used as a gatekeeper

326
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:15,720
that they would pick

327
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,740
um a project they didn't have no one

328
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,360
arrows around this right but if we go

329
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,519
back to 2019 there was an open issue on

330
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,579
the repo that they used that states

331
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,360
um

332
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,980
the author directly stated that there

333
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,480
was a bias towards Western faces that

334
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,700
they're aware of in the classify that

335
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,740
exemplify then went and chose for their

336
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,339
software

337
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,060
so what we've established here is that

338
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,399
the software is nearly Universal we

339
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,220
found that it can't meaningfully prevent

340
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,079
cheating from a technical perspective

341
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,880
it's mainly security theater so it looks

342
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,980
looks really strong but it doesn't

343
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,079
actually do too much for you and there's

344
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,360
significant overall usability concerns

345
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,820
with it the facial recognition doesn't

346
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,339
work well overall and it has additional

347
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,620
fairness components so this really leads

348
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,940
us to the question of should this

349
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,300
software be implemented at all and based

350
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,040
on our research we don't think there's

351
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
any

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
there's any place for the software and

353
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,779
production environments

354
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,820
um thank you all

355
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,540
um I'll now take questions
