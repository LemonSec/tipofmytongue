1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,679
and I'm here to present our work on

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,320
lumos a system to identify and localize

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,359
hidden iot devices in an unfamiliar

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,520
environment this work is done in

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,439
collaboration with ilahi who is now a

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,600
professor at UIUC and my advisor is

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Professor Anthony Rowe and we are sick

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,859
let's say you work into an Airbnb

10
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,480
everything looks normal but

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,280
unfortunately we live in a sad dystopian

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,380
reality enabled by the commoditization

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,899
of these iot devices that means there

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,940
could be iot devices around you spying

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,140
on you and recording all of your

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,520
personal activities

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,260
these devices could be easily installed

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,059
by either the previous guest or the

19
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,500
owner himself

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,420
these iot devices are also frequently

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,160
used by attackers to commit domestic

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,398
abuse

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,600
this threat is not just hypothetical and

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,399
is actually very very real a quick

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,199
Google search shows around eight

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,180
articles later on this problem just last

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,339
month

28
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,860
so what we really need is a system to

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,780
identify and localize a hidden iot

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,880
device that means a system should be

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,220
able to tell us oh there is a hidden

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,100
camera at a XYZ location

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,260
we actually went ahead and built such a

34
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,920
system this is a demo of a system called

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,020
lumos it first detects a list of iot

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,299
devices around you and displays them via

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,259
our mobile application

38
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,560
we then ask a user to take a short walk

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
across the space to localize them

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,740
after the localization is done a user

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,780
can visualize this hidden iot devices

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,600
via an AR application in real time using

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,460
just their mobile phones so for example

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,740
they can see there is a plug behind the

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,000
sofa

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,220
a hidden camera behind the flower pot

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,399
Etc

48
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,200
buildings of the system requires three

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,840
key components first we need a module to

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,340
capture the data in this case the

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,919
wireless signals coming from iot devices

52
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,900
second we need a data classification

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,239
module that can take this capture data

54
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,920
as the input and predict the device type

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
and last but not least we need a

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,120
localization module that can localize

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,220
and say like oh there is a camera at XYZ

58
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
location

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,879
catching data is difficult because of

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,220
the limited network access to the user a

61
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,780
user does not know how many devices are

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,580
out there what access points they are

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,080
connected to or what Wireless channels

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,400
they are using

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,620
to communicate

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,120
moreover these devices could be

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,739
operating on the main home network

68
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,720
whereas a user is only given access to a

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,180
guest Wi-Fi network

70
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,819
classifying data is difficult because

71
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,519
all the Wi-Fi traffic is encrypted that

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,780
means we don't have access to features

73
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,720
such as IP DNS ntp Etc which are widely

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,459
used for device fingerprinting but are

75
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,680
only available at the router

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,420
the problem becomes even more difficult

77
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,920
because of diverse transmission behavior

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,080
of iot devices a camera might be

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,120
transmitting let's say every 15

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,280
millisecond whereas a smart plug might

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,519
only transmit once every minute

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,440
localization is also challenging because

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,060
of limited physical access to the user

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,040
that means a user cannot instrument the

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
environment or install beacons to

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,700
localized devices

87
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,680
moreover typical user is also not

88
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,840
carrying expensive RF sensing equipment

89
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,060
with them to localize the devices but

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,620
what they have access to is a personal

91
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,239
device such as a mobile phone or a

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,540
laptop

93
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,040
none of the prior works are applicable

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,540
for our scenario they either require

95
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,640
dedicated Hardware privileged network

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,680
access or they cannot detect all types

97
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,360
of iot devices

98
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,299
our system lumos is the only one that

99
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,640
can detect and localize iot devices

100
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,099
while working with limited access and

101
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,140
also by just using a mobile phone or a

102
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,239
laptop

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,459
to develop lumos we had three several

104
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,519
Innova three key Innovations first we

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,980
propose a new data capturing module that

106
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,959
uses a greedy multi-arm bandwidth

107
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:04,860
approach

108
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,080
to learn the transmission behavior of

109
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,239
each device it then uses this

110
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,239
information to decide at every time T

111
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,159
when what channel to sense and for how

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,239
long

113
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,978
we also propose a new feature extraction

114
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,139
and classification algorithm that can

115
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,180
predict a device type by just using

116
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,600
encrypted Wi-Fi into 2.11 packets

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,880
we propose a new localization algorithm

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,919
that can localize the devices by

119
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,840
correlating a user's motion through the

120
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,780
space by the RSSI or received signal

121
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,100
strength indicator of the wireless

122
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,540
packets

123
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,460
in the interest of time I will only

124
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,080
describe the key insights behind our

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,180
data classification module but please

126
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,040
refer a paper for more details

127
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,020
our first Insight is that even at the

128
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,419
encrypted Wi-Fi a to 2.11 layer we see

129
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,340
some popular headers such as packet

130
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,979
length or packet time these are well

131
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,419
known features in device fingerprinting

132
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,979
and we can also see how they are varying

133
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,840
from device to device

134
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,360
but what we also have access to are

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
features specific to 82.11 protocol like

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
packet subtype

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,020
for example a specific subtype message

138
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,080
is used by iot device such as a smart

139
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,940
doorbell to tell the router that it's

140
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,680
going to sleep and before all of its

141
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,840
incoming packet whereas it's never used

142
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,540
in some other devices such as a camera

143
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,580
now this is one of the many unknown

144
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,440
features in the Wi-Fi 82.11 protocol

145
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,539
there are many many more so instead of

146
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,039
handcrafting these features or these

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,080
attributes what we propose is to extract

148
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,600
every possible header from E to 0.11

149
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,020
protocol

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,820
now let's say we want to build a feature

151
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,259
now this is how a typical feature

152
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,820
engineering pipeline looks like we

153
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,740
extract certain attributes like in this

154
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,600
case packet subtype observe its

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,820
variation over time now to compute a

156
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,919
feature at a time T we first Define an

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,500
aggregation window called Delta

158
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,240
now inside this aggregation window we

159
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,979
Define some aggregate functions such as

160
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,380
main histogram entropy

161
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,720
now to compute feature at a time T we

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,580
apply this aggregate functions for all

163
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,840
the packets inside that aggregation

164
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,740
window

165
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,720
now the problem lies in how do you

166
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,180
decide this aggregation window

167
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,039
if you choose a very small aggregation

168
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,560
window you will be extremely prone to

169
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,940
noise whereas picking a large

170
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,560
aggregation window will dilute the minor

171
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
variation this is also referred to as

172
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
bias variance trade of Indian machine

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
learning literature what we ideally want

174
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,360
is a small Delta for a high transmission

175
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,400
device such as a camera and a large

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,960
Delta for a low transmission device such

177
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,639
as a smart plug

178
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,259
so again instead of handcrafting this

179
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,660
Delta what we propose is a bunch of

180
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,940
these aggregate Windows now at a feature

181
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,000
at a time T is this combination of

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
aggregate functions applied to each of

183
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,340
these aggregate windows

184
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,919
this is how our pipeline Works a user's

185
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,720
walk around the room sniffing encrypted

186
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
Wi-Fi to 2011 packets

187
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,919
we first build the features using a

188
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,360
multi-time resolution algorithm that we

189
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,259
propose

190
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,180
now since these features could have very

191
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,699
wide variance we normalize them

192
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,259
we didn't do the initial pruning to

193
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,699
remove the features that are correlated

194
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,380
or some of the values that don't change

195
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,340
at all

196
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,500
we didn't train a one versus machine

197
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,199
learning classifier that also helps in

198
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,660
our case because we have a very class

199
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,220
imbalance data set we have many more

200
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,479
training samples coming from a camera

201
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,180
compared to let's say a smart bulb this

202
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,060
also helps because now each classifier

203
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,919
can pick its own set of relevant

204
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,300
features

205
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,400
now we make a prediction at every time T

206
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,138
and do a majority of footing in the end

207
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,639
our evaluation setup consists of 44

208
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,220
different iot devices spanning multiple

209
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,460
vendors across nine different categories

210
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,460
this is a picture of our setup which we

211
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,780
use for training and testing our system

212
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,220
first what I am showing the result is

213
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,080
from a prior work that assumes full

214
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,240
network access at the router which is

215
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,639
Impractical for our scenario and as you

216
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,440
can see it works quite well across the

217
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,680
board can detect all types of devices

218
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,780
now for each device on the x-axis we

219
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,460
plot the accuracy of our system called

220
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,780
lumos

221
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,479
and as you can see the lumos achieves

222
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,919
just slightly lower accuracy than the

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,960
prior work and that is to be expected

224
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,759
because the Privacy is assuming root

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,620
access to the router and extracting all

226
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,960
the privileged header Fields such as ipd

227
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,000
and SMTP etcetera where we are working

228
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,979
with only encrypted Wi-Fi to 2.11

229
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,319
headers

230
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,419
that said our system still has a few

231
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,800
limitations

232
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,319
the first one is sniffing 80.11 packets

233
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,460
is currently disabled by the device

234
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,440
manufacturers although there is no

235
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,299
fundamental Hardware or software

236
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,799
limitation to do so and this could be

237
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,320
easy easily enabled provided enough

238
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,779
justification but for now to bypass this

239
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,599
limitation we use Raspberry Pi paired

240
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,760
with the mobile phone to do the Wi-Fi

241
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,000
sniffing Wi-Fi packet capturing

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,220
an expert attacker could also modify the

243
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,500
device Behavior to evade detection so

244
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,000
for example let's say they can hack the

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
firmware to change the transmission

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,740
Behavior or just store the data locally

247
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,779
now that said majority of the everyday

248
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,459
attackers are out there don't have the

249
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,320
sufficient expertise to hack the

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,360
firmware

251
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,040
and the future work in this space can

252
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,320
also include building similar system for

253
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
other Wireless Technologies such as

254
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,720
zigbee Bluetooth or even 5G

255
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,519
so to conclude

256
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,779
you don't have to worry about iot

257
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,459
devices spying on you next time you go

258
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,320
to an Airbnb or a hotel because we

259
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,880
present a practical system called lumos

260
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,100
in 30 minutes it can identify devices

261
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,740
with 95 accuracy and can also localize

262
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,680
them with a median error of 1.5 meters

263
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,420
this is made possible by our

264
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,339
contributions in data capturing with

265
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,260
limited aprily knowledge device

266
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,899
classification with limited features and

267
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,700
localization with no infrastructure

268
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,500
support

269
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,660
we have released a very early prototype

270
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,480
of our system at the provided link so

271
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,920
feel free to check it out

272
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,300
and I will be happy to take any

273
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,500
questions thank you
