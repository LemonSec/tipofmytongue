00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,500
hello everyone I'm saurabh Sinha and

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,540
I'll be presenting our paper

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,700
physical air attacks against pulse with

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,220
modulation control actuators

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,680
in this paper we develop iemi based

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,840
false accusation injection attacks for

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,539
pwn control actuators such as Servo and

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,660
DC motor and the attack takes place at

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,000
Point 1 in the figure and is done by the

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,859
blocking or altering the actuation data

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,860
in the encoded in the pwm signals now

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,320
there are Fai attack waveforms for servo

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,360
motor reported in the literature but

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,219
they are limited in terms of attack

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,739
distance and rotation direction these

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,719
approach also assume that the attacker

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,039
is synchronized to the victim pwm signal

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,960
um in our work we overcome these

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,600
limitations our attack attacks work at

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
larger distance can rotate the server in

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,379
any direction and don't need to be

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,160
synchronized uh to the victim pwm

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,860
also compared to the IEM IP sensor

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,580
attacks either attacks at 0.2 uh the

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,280
effect um the Fai attacks are more

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
effective as they cannot be easily

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,860
mitigated uh by using for example robust

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,320
data estimators however these attacks

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,380
require higher induced voltages that are

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,939
comparable to the

31
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,180
aptitude of the victim pwm

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,759
the pwm is a widely used actuation

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,799
signal to transmit actually actuation

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,799
data it is a rectangular waveform uh

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,700
with the period ppwm of 20 milliseconds

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,299
and the duration T High varies between

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,280
one and two milliseconds and carries the

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,659
actuation information

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,600
for a Servo for example uh the high of

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,759
one millisecond would mean rotation to

41
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,520
one extreme 1.5 will mean neutral and

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,560
then 2 millisecond would mean rotation

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,659
to The Other Extreme similarly for a DC

44
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,079
motor one millisecond is zero RPM and 2

45
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,659
milliseconds is maximum rpm

46
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,200
and actuator computes the T High by uh

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,419
Computing the duration between the

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,819
rising and the falling edges of the of

49
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,459
the pwm

50
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,160
the goal of the attacker is to launch uh

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,040
low power Fai attacks to block or take

52
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,379
control of the pwm

53
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,420
um pay statutes through electromagnetic

54
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,640
coupling to do so the attacker must

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
prevent the transmission of P high or

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
modify T High the victims are cyber

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,440
physical systems with pwm actuators it

58
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,420
is assumed that the attacker has the

59
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,040
dimensional information of the victim

60
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,700
circuitry for example the pwm cable lens

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,580
and the attacker can either design or

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,580
acquire a resonant Loop antennas power

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,280
amplifiers and RF components

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,900
the major challenge for the attacker is

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,819
to induce high voltages at different

66
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,760
distances for successful attacks

67
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,459
are the two most successful attack uh

68
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,260
waveform that are reported are the block

69
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,300
and full control waveform a block

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,540
waveform is a continuous uh wave signal

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,280
at certain frequency

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
that prevents the detection of the

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,580
rising and the falling ages of the

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,680
original pwm thereby blocking the

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,500
control of the actuators

76
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,900
the full control

77
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,140
waveform consists of frequent

78
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,180
frequent sinusoid pulses with smaller

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,180
period these pulses mask the original

80
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,760
pwm signal

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,900
um

82
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,120
these signals are basically High duty

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
cycle signals and the duty cycle is

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
increased by uh decreasing the period

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,739
from 20 millisecond to 2.1 millisecond

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,280
and the attacker controls the actuator

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,739
by changing T rotate between one and two

88
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,900
milliseconds

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,959
foreign

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,019
the attacker utilizes magnetic

91
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,040
electromagnetic coupling to induce mode

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,720
voltage in the near field region of the

93
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,200
antenna the coupling ratio is calculated

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,239
experimentally and

95
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,860
it is observed that there is a weak

96
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,340
coupling because K is much much less

97
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,540
than one

98
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,180
now to that's why we utilize magnetic

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,340
resonant coupling to transfer power

100
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,220
because they are efficient they are an

101
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,600
efficient way of transferring power

102
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,540
remote wirelessly even in weekly coupled

103
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,940
scenarios and thus the optimum condition

104
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,860
is that the attack waveform frequency

105
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,660
should be equal to the resonant

106
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,820
frequency of the antenna and that should

107
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,259
be equal to the victim resonant

108
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,240
frequency

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,900
now the to detect the victim resonant

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,699
frequency the attacker can use either an

111
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,620
analytical or an experimental approach

112
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,100
the United analytical uh approach gets a

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,300
good estimation of the resonant

114
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,160
frequency with limited information which

115
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,960
is the only thing that information that

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,580
is required is the length of the pwm

117
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,660
cable

118
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,979
now

119
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,740
uh the the calculated analytical

120
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,800
frequencies are 70 Hertz and 175 Hertz

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,620
for the aileron flap okay

122
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
we also compute the resonant frequency

123
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,699
experimentally where a transmission

124
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,759
measurement is conducted with a trans

125
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,340
excitation and measurement chloride and

126
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,080
the maximum and the resonance frequency

127
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,360
is detected when there is a maximum

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,320
transmission

129
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,780
and which occurs at 61 megahertz for

130
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,679
aileron and uh 152 megahertz for flap

131
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,900
um we then demonstrate the attack in an

132
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,240
indoor environment on the ailerons of an

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
unmanned Eagle system the attacker

134
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,160
system consists of a waveform generator

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,120
a 20 watt RF amplifier a0 phase shift

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,100
line and 10 are resonating attack

137
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,740
frequency of 61 megahertz

138
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,180
be elron rotation is measured using a

139
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,520
quadrature encoder

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,500
block attack is carried out at a

141
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,220
distance of 50 centimeter the blue curve

142
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,680
shows the shows the commanded rotation

143
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,020
angle that is

144
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,940
um commanded by the

145
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,759
victims controller can be actually when

146
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,860
and since the actuator is under a block

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,979
attack the actuator does not respond and

148
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,100
stays at its initial position of the

149
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,320
zero of zero degree as shown in the uh

150
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,759
shown by the red

151
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,979
uh line

152
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,100
the full control attack is demonstrated

153
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,259
at a distance of 25 centimeter in this

154
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,800
case the commanded electron elron angle

155
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,919
shown by the blue line is zero the

156
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,440
attacker changes the T rotate at every

157
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,560
three seconds to control the aileron and

158
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,960
the actuator is shown to respond to

159
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,180
these commands by rotating in the

160
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,900
desired Direction by the desired amount

161
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,240
now we also study how the attack power

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,940
varies with the distance the indoor

163
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,740
demonstration with 20 watt amplifier

164
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,660
show that the maximum attack distance is

165
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,759
50 centimeter for block and 25

166
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,699
centimeter Photon for full control to

167
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,100
study the variation we simulate the

168
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
field distribution of two zspl antennas

169
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,960
one is 35 Plus 35 that is used in the

170
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,539
indoor attack and other is a larger one

171
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,960
70 cross 70. from the figure we see that

172
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,180
the block attack require less power than

173
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,400
full control attack and

174
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,360
um and as the attack increases the power

175
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,400
required increases

176
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,199
um so if you increase the block distance

177
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,740
from 50 to uh

178
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,139
52 centimeter to 2 meters the power

179
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,139
required is 532 watt with a larger

180
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,599
antenna and 1.38 kilowatt with a smaller

181
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,120
antenna and also for full control if we

182
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,099
increase it from 25 centimeter to one

183
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,280
meter the power required are 611 Watt

184
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,318
and 3.3 kilowatt respectively

185
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,039
um we also do wired attacks on DC motors

186
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,960
the rotational speed up which is

187
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,319
controlled by the pwm signal we test

188
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,759
multiple electronic speed controllers

189
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,699
escs with a DC motor and then the

190
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,160
project wired at a given frequency

191
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,319
varies with the uh

192
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,800
varies with the ESC now the block attack

193
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,319
stops the operation of the motor

194
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,680
uh for all EOC models and unfortunately

195
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,720
the full control attacks show this same

196
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,639
behavior as the block attack that is

197
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,379
instead of controlling the speed it just

198
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,280
stops the uh motor now as seen in the

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
figure even after the attack stops at T

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,779
Square to 20 the DC motor does not

201
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,440
retain its RPM and that is because the

202
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,719
motor goes into the disarmed state after

203
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,380
being left idle for 10 seconds

204
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,020
finally we demonstrated demonstrate the

205
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,720
block and a full controller attacks on

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,480
ailerons of uas during flight uh the

207
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,279
elderon's effect electrons affect the

208
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,800
rolling motion of the uas above the

209
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,459
x-axis we fly the uas in stabilized mode

210
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,620
where the ground controller sends or the

211
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,540
human pilot sends the role set points

212
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,940
and Pixar computes the desired rotation

213
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,360
angle and sends it to the aileron the

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,300
attacker system is mounted on top of the

215
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,240
uas and consists of a Optical

216
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,540
transmitter and receiver a 20 meter 20

217
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,700
watt RF module

218
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,680
NRF

219
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,620
sorry a 20 watt RF amplifier RF model

220
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,779
you put that repo battery and the

221
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,260
antenna the victim controller is

222
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,000
programmed to initiate the attacks and

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,920
the the attack signals are sent as

224
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,600
Optical signals so that they are not

225
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,420
affected by the Emi the RF switch

226
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,880
modulates the attack waveform which is

227
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,920
then fed to the RF amplifier

228
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,500
with an output of 20 volt and finally

229
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,959
the attack waveforms are radiated by the

230
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,680
antenna

231
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,320
foreign

232
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,899
angle of the elron we use a quadrature

233
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,360
encoder with the isolated circuitry so

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,880
that they are not affected by the Emi

235
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,360
now

236
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,459
um in the block attack demonstration

237
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,700
before the attack starts the pilot sends

238
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,459
continuously varying role set points and

239
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,220
the uh the controller victim controller

240
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,959
computes the error electron angle and

241
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,140
the alaron is shown to rotate by those

242
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,540
angles but as shown as the attacks start

243
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,880
at P Square t is equal to zero the

244
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,519
aileron freezes at its current position

245
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,399
thus the roll angle keeps increasing and

246
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,320
the altitude keeps decreasing now when

247
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,980
the attack stops at around 2.2 seconds

248
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,820
the altitude the uh aircraft loses a lot

249
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,420
of altitude and then eventually crashes

250
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,220
and then you can see the that happening

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,839
here in the video

252
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,600
that there is no attack and then the

253
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,940
pilot will send continuous several set

254
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,160
points and aircraft will follow that and

255
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,019
then it will freeze and the attack

256
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,800
starts Dash

257
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,699
foreign

258
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,800
for that and after that when the attack

259
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,680
starts at T is equal to zero the

260
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,320
attacker sensitive rotate of minus 1.8

261
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,779
meter per second which rotates the L

262
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,640
wrong in the negative direction making

263
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,220
the aircraft roll

264
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,600
and after the attack stops the elron

265
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,880
complete Rolls by around 180 degrees but

266
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,760
the victim controller

267
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,320
successfully regains the control and

268
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,959
then holds it back again

269
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,560
foreign

270
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,700
that there is no attack

271
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,200
now the attack starts rolling the

272
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,440
aircraft the attack stops and the victim

273
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,420
controller against the control of the

274
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,719
aircraft

275
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,680
so to conclude uh IEM we have shown that

276
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,860
our Emi is a significant threat for pwm

277
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,640
based activation control and uh study of

278
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,339
counter measures are needed thank you
