foreign

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,679
malicious plugins in WordPress

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,580
marketplaces now this book was done

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,660
with all of my colleagues in Georgia

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,580
Tech at the Sci-Fi lab advised by

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,640
Professor Brendan Salter for Maggio

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,019
all right

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,599
everyone has a website nowadays

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,119
even my grandmother in India has a

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,040
website

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,520
now how does my grandma have a website

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,620
this is because she relies on content

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,460
Management systems or cms's cms's are an

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,260
amalgam of layout software and

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,960
interpreters that abstract away the low

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,620
level systems from the website developer

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,260
the CMS itself can be thought of as CMS

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,600
core and CMS plugins that contains the

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,460
code templates that allow someone such

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,100
as my grandma to drag and drop and build

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,739
a full-fledged website

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,680
but where does my grandma get all of her

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,260
plugins from she gets it from the

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,299
marketplaces there are unpaid

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,740
marketplaces as well as paid

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,439
marketplaces some of the popular unpaid

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,939
marketplaces of Wordpress plugins

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,040
WordPress themes and also surprisingly

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,040
GitHub the paid Marketplace is the

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,840
popular ones for WordPress are theme

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,500
forest code Canyon wpmu Dev and Easy

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,600
Digital downloads

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,640
now these paid marketplaces for

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,400
WordPress alone form a multi-million

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,100
dollar economy the plugins that are sold

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,020
to your cost anywhere between two to a

37
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,700
little over a thousand dollars with an

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,119
average of 63 dollars per plug-in

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,220
um these plugins are downloaded anywhere

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,799
between five times to 260 million times

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,500
with an average of 939

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,259
000 or download count

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,380
now the code on sold on all of these

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,240
marketplaces the plugin code is mostly

45
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,040
unvetted

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
also the plugins on my grandma's website

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,680
they have Limitless access to all of the

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,140
layers of these websites what could

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,979
possibly go wrong

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,379
um so the as part of the current

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,080
industry standard the website owners

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,720
rely on weak assumptions such as the

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,459
plug-in popularity or reviews and

54
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,140
ratings before installing plugins on

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,760
their website

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,739
some of the cautious website owners

57
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,140
could rely on security plugins or

58
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,360
vulnerability databases

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
um before getting any plugin on their

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,959
website

61
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,080
however our research found that these

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,780
weak indicators are insufficient and

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,000
that the attackers are literally selling

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
malicious plugins to unsuspecting

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,739
victims

66
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,379
in fact we had the unique opportunity to

67
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,540
collaborate with codeguard who is one of

68
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,040
the largest website backup service

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,620
providers on the market this gave us

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,720
access to the nightly backup snapshots

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,140
of over 400 000 websites

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,780
spanning eight years between July 2012

73
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,000
and July 2020

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,459
and we found over a million dollars

75
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,800
worth website plugins that were either

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,379
infected pyrated or outright malicious

77
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,580
to study the source and impact of

78
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,980
malicious plugins at scale we developed

79
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,060
Yoda

80
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,580
Yoda takes the web server file system as

81
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,340
input it first identifies the plugins

82
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,140
and then identifies how many of these

83
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,060
plugins are malicious followed by

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,560
identifying the origin of these

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,879
malicious plugins

86
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,400
to finally revealed the impact metrics

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,620
or the damage done because of these

88
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,400
malicious plugins

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,860
Yoda scans the web server file system to

90
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,599
First identify the plugins on the web

91
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,459
server

92
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,299
to do this uh Yoda uses the plugin

93
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,920
header now the plugin header contains

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,680
the plugin name or the plugin URL the

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,680
author details description Etc it also

96
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,860
looks for the referenced files as well

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,959
as the apis used by a group of files

98
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,900
before grouping them as a plugin

99
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,840
now it's important to note that cms's

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
loads the plugin via the plugin header

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
so attacker plugins must also have

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,780
headers

103
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,180
as part of Yoda's malicious now Yoda

104
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,400
Yoda then proceeds to identify malicious

105
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,220
plugins now this can be challenging

106
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,780
um this is because we found that

107
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,580
attackers distribute malicious code

108
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,280
across different files so interfile

109
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,840
interaction is a challenge

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,940
also each of these behaviors have

111
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,979
multiple code implementations so

112
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,780
rule-based detection directly cannot

113
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,460
work

114
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,520
so how does Yoda detect these malicious

115
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,860
behaviors

116
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,380
for each of the plugin files Yoda first

117
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,600
generates the AST or the abstract syntax

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,919
tree

119
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,620
it then merges the individual asts by

120
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,479
resolving the dependencies and generates

121
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,240
a dependency resolved AST so this

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,740
addresses the interfile interaction

123
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,160
challenge

124
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,419
Yoda then identifies the suspicious

125
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,580
sinks on all of these dependency

126
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,979
resolved asts and performs backward

127
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,360
slicing

128
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,259
um

129
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,380
starting from the suspicious things

130
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,380
so these are some of the data flow

131
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,479
models for the militia the data flow

132
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,520
models for the malicious behaviors that

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,620
you would identify so column one shows

134
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,620
all of the malicious behaviors now for

135
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,840
example let me just explain one of the

136
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,600
behaviors so let's consider SSO backdoor

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,120
which is a single sign-on backdoor

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,900
um

139
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,360
here Yoda looks for this particular data

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,699
flow where an attacker creates a new

141
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,919
user changes the permissions to provide

142
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,259
admin privileges for this user then

143
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,600
registers the user with the CMS and

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,300
redirects all of the requests to this

145
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,900
new user's admin URL so whenever Yoda

146
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,520
finds this data flow then it Flags the

147
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,800
plugin as malicious with an SSO backdoor

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,740
Behavior so the additional details for

149
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,699
all of the other models are in the paper

150
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,620
and this is how Yoda finds malicious

151
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,539
plugins

152
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,600
now we the next question that we want to

153
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,120
look at is what are the sources of

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,340
malicious plugins these malicious

155
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,720
plugins could either come from

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,419
legitimate plug-in marketplaces this is

157
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,400
where attackers can upload malicious

158
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,380
plugins on legitimate marketplaces

159
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,080
either by buying the codeblaze of

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,840
popular plugins or by directly uploading

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,600
malicious plugins for sale

162
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,120
malicious plugins could also be injected

163
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,460
this is where attackers inject fake

164
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,020
plugins that are not sold on any

165
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,139
Marketplace by exploiting web server or

166
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,840
plug-in vulnerabilities

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
malicious plugins could also be infected

168
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,900
plugins

169
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,120
attackers use pre-existing malicious

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,460
plugins to then laterally infect other

171
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,500
plugins on the web server

172
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,220
or another key is of malicious plugins

173
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,900
is that they can come from nulled

174
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,060
marketplaces these are pirated

175
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,039
marketplaces that distribute paid

176
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,319
plugins for free with the only caveat

177
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,660
that these are secretly packed with

178
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,319
malicious code

179
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,000
now our collaboration with codeguard

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,759
gave us access to our data set codeguard

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,500
maintains the nightly backup snapshots

182
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,960
of their clients websites

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,419
when we developed Yoda you code guard

184
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,580
gave us access to these nightly backups

185
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,620
of their websites

186
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,860
um which was about 400 000 websites

187
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,840
spanning etios we ran Yoda on these

188
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,880
websites and here are the results of

189
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,599
Yoda's malicious behavior distribution

190
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,940
so Yoda was deployed on over 400 000

191
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,500
websites and if found over 47 000

192
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,160
malicious plug-in instances across about

193
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,400
25 000 websites

194
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
we know that code obfuscation and web

195
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,520
shell malicious behavior has been used

196
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,639
in plugins since 2012.

197
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,400
now as these cms's introduce newer

198
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,099
features such as the single sign-on uh

199
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,560
these also started getting used in

200
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,199
malicious behaviors so new features such

201
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,120
as single sign-on backdoor was

202
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,919
introduced in malicious plugins since

203
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,259
May 2019 and it was introduced as a

204
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,099
feature only in late 2018.

205
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,680
now let's look at the economic drivers

206
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,020
of malicious plugins

207
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,599
about 70 of the plugins that came from

208
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,820
legitimate Marketplace I mean about 70

209
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,679
of the malicious plugins that came from

210
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,200
legitimate marketplaces

211
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,659
um these were found in five of the seven

212
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,360
most popular marketplaces so GitHub and

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,459
Easy Digital downloads did not have any

214
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,920
malicious plugins directly distributed

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,380
on their Marketplace

216
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,839
the website owners in our data set spent

217
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,420
a little over forty one thousand dollars

218
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,580
to buy malicious plugins from legitimate

219
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,260
marketplaces

220
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,839
recall that null plugins impersonate

221
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,120
plugins from legitimate marketplaces

222
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,100
so the website owners from our data set

223
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,399
alone contributed to 228

224
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,100
000 in explicit losses to plug-in

225
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,459
authors

226
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,140
we expected null plugins to impersonate

227
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,000
and distribute only the paid plugins

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,860
surprisingly we found that they

229
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,560
impersonated unpaid plugins from unpaid

230
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,260
marketplaces as well

231
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,260
the website owners in our data set spent

232
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,240
a total of eight hundred thirty four

233
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,459
thousand dollars on plugins only to

234
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,200
later find them compromised after being

235
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,399
installed on their websites

236
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,380
um now we dive deeper into some of the

237
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,600
malicious behaviors found in the plugins

238
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,519
that were distributed directly via

239
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,700
legitimate marketplaces

240
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,399
so we know that none of the plugins that

241
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,560
were sold on legitimate marketplaces had

242
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,320
any obfuscation techniques

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,120
despite being sold on legitimate

244
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,279
marketplaces these attackers are hiding

245
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,959
in plain sight

246
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,279
in fact we found instances of

247
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
well-commented malicious code in over

248
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
2000 plugins that had spam injection

249
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,200
Behavior

250
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,720
so we can say that the attackers rightly

251
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,760
assume that an average website owner

252
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,980
will not inspect the plug-in code before

253
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,660
installing it on their web server

254
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,000
here are some of the findings from the

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
null marketplaces so column one shows uh

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,100
the popular null marketplaces that the

257
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,260
website owners in our data set use to

258
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,320
download pirated plugins

259
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,339
vestathemes.com was the most popular

260
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,579
null marketplace with uh website owners

261
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,920
from over 2000 websites installed over

262
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,220
3000 plugins in our data set

263
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,320
now we found that not all of the plugins

264
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
that were distributed on null

265
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
marketplaces were malicious but majority

266
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,399
of them were about 97 of all plugins

267
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,320
that came from null marketplaces in our

268
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,620
data set were found to be malicious

269
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,480
these null plugins have been around

270
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,380
since 2013 but the malicious activity on

271
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,120
these null plugins began only since late

272
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,740
2015.

273
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,740
we also found that the average cost that

274
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,860
a website owner is saving by installing

275
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,500
these plugins is about 59 because the

276
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,839
legitimate counterparts of these pirated

277
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,440
plugins is the average cost is about 59

278
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,120
so they're not pirating the thousand

279
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
dollar plugins but they're just getting

280
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,920
the regular 59 plugins

281
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,100
the black hat SEO campaign on these uh

282
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,660
plug-in sold on null marketplaces

283
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,660
accelerated in 2019.

284
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,820
this is where attackers introduce

285
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,680
malicious plugins on these nulled or

286
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,779
pirated marketplaces the victim

287
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,760
downloads these plugins and the

288
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,560
blackhead SEO campaign is activated

289
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,620
which then redirects more victims into

290
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,480
their Marketplace

291
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,360
so the Google search if you if you look

292
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,800
for the Google search for any popular

293
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,180
WordPress plugin or theme free download

294
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,540
almost always ends up with some night

295
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,880
Marketplace in the top five results

296
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,459
in fact here's a screenshot of a plugin

297
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,279
named do play for WordPress which was

298
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,820
priced at 80 and the highlighted four of

299
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,120
the five search results lead to a nulled

300
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,399
or a pirated Marketplace

301
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,279
so despite public alerts about the Rogue

302
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,260
black hat SEO malware campaign in

303
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,660
February 2019 the attackers have

304
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,880
successfully maintained their ranks on

305
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,839
the search engine results

306
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,860
finally we wanted to answer the question

307
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,680
if these malicious plugins that are

308
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,660
installed on

309
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,880
the websites and our data set are they

310
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,620
really cleaned up

311
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,980
Yoda found about 25 000 websites that

312
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,360
were infected with malicious plugins

313
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,760
10.8 percent of these websites attempted

314
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,980
to clean up these malicious plugins

315
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,620
however 12.5 percent of these websites

316
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,500
found that these plugins were reinfected

317
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,899
despite the cleanup

318
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,060
shockingly at the end of our study in

319
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,480
July 2021

320
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,760
94.6 of the websites with these

321
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,480
malicious plugins were still infected

322
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,779
in conclusion we presented Yoda and

323
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,220
automated framework to identify

324
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,920
malicious plugins and their origin Yoda

325
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,380
identified over 47 000 malicious plug-in

326
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,380
instances across 25 000 websites

327
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,540
and Yoda found over a million dollars

328
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,420
worth plugins that were infected pyrated

329
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,240
or outright malicious

330
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,740
thank you open for questions
