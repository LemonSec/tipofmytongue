1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,160
from system security lab in case

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,359
so today I will be talking about video

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,400
identification attack and more precisely

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,640
how an unauthorized adversary can

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,180
identif find a user who watches a

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,279
particular video over the cellular

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,980
network so this is Joint work with my

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,200
colleague Minter tongwan churchon

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,660
geother and young day

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,020
so nowadays we all use smartphones to

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,879
watch the videos from YouTube Netflix

13
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,260
and so on

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,620
and also we are connected to the seller

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,039
Network and use it for watching videos

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,899
so why am I talking about the watching

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,899
videos because once watching history

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,960
tells one's political financial interest

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,739
and Personality and Social Status

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,559
so therefore video privacy protection

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,979
act prevents the disclosure of one's

22
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,240
watching history

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,000
so this shows that it is indeed

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,580
important to be protected

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,640
so imagine that one can identify what

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,920
someone is watching so especially unlike

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
these pictures can adversely identify

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,799
the video played on the victims one

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,979
without taking a sneak peek at one's

30
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,340
device peacefully so today I'm mainly

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,080
focused on two points

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,220
so first can add adversary to this

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,000
identification without Perico's help or

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,579
installing malware on the device

35
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,579
and second point is a bit different so

36
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,579
can we physically expose a victim who is

37
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,979
watching a particular video in other

38
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,820
words

39
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,640
the first question is identifying a

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,700
movie while the second question is

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,460
identifying a victim watching the

42
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,780
particular video

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,939
so there are two main ideas to answer

44
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,140
this question

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,419
so first video traffic is

46
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,940
fingerprintable so several studies

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,400
introduced video identification attack

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,620
in the wired Network

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,900
and as the recent video system called

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,140
Haas delivered the video into segmented

51
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,080
way and each segment has different size

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,260
due to the variable encoding rate

53
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,459
and

54
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,879
This research the honor pattern showing

55
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,920
a distinctive traffic

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,959
over each video

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,599
so and note that the previous Works

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,780
required direct access to the big team's

59
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,700
Network infrastructures

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,000
and their devices and we show these are

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,940
not required in the cellular network

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,620
so the second is in iot as the Martin

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,239
explained in the previous talk the

64
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,860
Downing schedule information is

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,800
broadcast without any protection in

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,260
other words the victim's ionic resource

67
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,220
information are continuously exposed

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,940
so therefore the adversary can sniff the

69
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,000
Downing traffic of all users in the base

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,180
station without tacos permission so

71
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,540
based on these two ideas so we come up

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,879
with the video identification attack

73
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,840
so our Tech consists of three phase so

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,480
in the first phase the attackers select

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,819
the target videos and compute their

76
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,040
fingerprints based on the recorded

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,640
traffic and then prepares the attack by

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,260
building a class wire

79
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,080
that identifies the target videos

80
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,260
and next the attacker reside on the

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,360
target cell and monitor the atomic

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,099
traffic of all users

83
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,459
with the previous classifiers the

84
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,280
attacker identifies the UE

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,000
or user who is watching the one of the

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,060
video in the set and finally in the

87
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,940
tracking phase the attacker exposes the

88
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,140
victim by forcing it to make a loud tone

89
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,659
enabling the attacker to possibly locate

90
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,459
the victim

91
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,100
and it looks simple but there are

92
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,320
several challenges at each phase

93
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,060
the first

94
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,000
due to looking at the lower layer we

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,180
have limited monitoring capability and I

96
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,320
will talk about

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,960
C2 and 2 C4 over there where C2 and C3

98
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,240
are difficulties caused by the video

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
streaming over the commercial cellular

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,820
network and I will also talk about C4

101
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,360
and how about how can we conduct an

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,840
attack to rebuild the victim's location

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,060
so one of the interesting challenges in

104
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,040
monitoring the video traffic in the

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,020
cellular network is that the identifier

106
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,139
user is frequently changing

107
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,660
so the commercial streaming system has

108
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,419
on off pattern so there is no data

109
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,820
transmission period and when it comes to

110
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,320
the cellular network

111
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,440
the commercial Network especially the

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,380
network release releases the radio

113
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,259
connection when there is no traffic for

114
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,900
a certain period so as the figure shows

115
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,600
this research that the temporary

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,180
identifier victim is changing whenever

117
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,440
it receives a video segment and note

118
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,900
that these temporary identifier is

119
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,479
anonymized one so therefore

120
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,840
the the adversary should Trace

121
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,539
victims changing identifiers

122
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,360
to monitor the complete traffic

123
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,699
and another challenge is that when the

124
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,100
video is delivered to the user the

125
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,440
cellular network in these days use

126
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
multiple Channels with the help of

127
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,880
another base stations and it is called

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,160
carrier aggregation so by doing this the

129
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,860
network can boost its Downing speed

130
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,180
however when it comes to the attacker

131
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,340
the attacker only can calculate the

132
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,560
traffic volume for the one base station

133
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,160
and fail to monitor the complete traffic

134
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,039
so to solve these challenges we fully

135
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,139
utilize the exposed information to the

136
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,039
air

137
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,100
but in this 12-minute presentation it is

138
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,020
difficult to explain in detail but I

139
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,600
would try but you may want to read the

140
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,759
paper for the details

141
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,400
so for for the first regarding the

142
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,160
identifier changing issues we constantly

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,259
monitor that radio connection procedure

144
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,080
as the cellular network uses multiple

145
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,080
identifiers and some of the identifiers

146
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,740
do not change as frequently as the radio

147
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,419
ID called rnti which is changing during

148
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,000
the video streaming that I explained so

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,819
using these different identifiers I mean

150
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,639
not frequently changing identifiers you

151
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,440
can link rntis

152
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,280
and next multi-channel issue can also be

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,620
easily solved using a sequence number

154
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,900
maintained in the cellular network

155
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,240
as you see in the picture by looking at

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,699
the sequence number you can identify the

157
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,880
misting packets and therefore you can

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,120
compute the complete traffic volume and

159
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,800
by doing this we can monitor the

160
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,759
complete traffic with only one C3 device

161
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,099
and lastly how can we expose the

162
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,220
victim's location I mean the key idea

163
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,620
here is that only the target device

164
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,099
receives the presidential alert messages

165
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,220
and to do this the attacker forces only

166
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,979
the victim to attach a fake base station

167
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:44,580
so the usual a fake base station attack

168
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,060
tries to attack the oil users but on the

169
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,199
other end in our attack only the Target

170
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,240
only the target victim attached to a

171
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,400
fake base station and this is the most

172
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,919
different part than the fake base

173
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,680
station sends pretty intentional lots to

174
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,720
the Target victim

175
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,780
and finally the victim makes a loud

176
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,500
alarm and expose its physical presence

177
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,919
the hard part is the first step how can

178
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,360
you force it

179
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,880
so for this we extend the signal over

180
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,639
sharing attack which we published in

181
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,900
three years ago

182
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,620
so we extend this attack to support

183
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,720
injecting the unicast message that makes

184
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,599
the victim move to a fake base station

185
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,599
that running in the unused frequency

186
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,279
so I want to show to them first

187
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,020
so as you see we set three mobile

188
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,600
devices and one in the left we're

189
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,980
watching the video

190
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,100
which is not our Target list and one in

191
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,620
the middle I will watch the video we

192
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,640
target

193
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,700
and the last one in the right is in the

194
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,279
either State meaning that where there is

195
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,600
no communication between the base

196
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,560
station

197
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,580
and all devices are actually connected

198
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,040
to the commercial Network

199
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,100
so once the victims start to watch

200
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,220
it takes some time for same thing

201
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,279
and as you see the fake base station

202
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,200
is running in the unused frequency so so

203
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,779
that the device are still connected to

204
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,459
the commercial Network without any alarm

205
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,820
and

206
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,779
[Music]

207
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,620
yep so once it identified the adversary

208
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,500
selectively force a victim to move to

209
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,300
their fake base station without

210
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,260
disrupting other victims so as you see

211
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,240
only the targeted one would raise the

212
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,800
alarm

213
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,860
we also verify our attacks feasibility

214
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,060
in various environment and please check

215
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,640
the details research and the analysis in

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,060
our paper

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,640
so in this talk I presented video

218
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,860
identification attack on the commercial

219
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,160
external network and previous and this

220
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,680
presentation showed that cellular

221
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,279
network has serious privacy problem

222
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,980
and these are the attacks will not never

223
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,140
be patched in the it

224
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,279
and for 5G maybe I like I'd like to see

225
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,420
what happened

226
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,180
so that's what I have to stay in this

227
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,180
talk so please check our paper and

228
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,959
GitHub for the details and thanks and

229
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,518
I'll be happy to take questions
