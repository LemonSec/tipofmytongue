1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,740
hello everyone I'm reubenhood from

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
Georgia University today I'd like to

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,260
talk about our work on OK Siri or hey

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,539
Google evaluating voice brings

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,539
distinctiveness via contents based Pro

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,920
score

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,859
this is our agenda first I'm going to

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,199
motivate our work and then talk about

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,019
its challenging methodology

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,020
then I will introduce how to define a

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,300
pro score and wrap up my talk with

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,880
findings and conclusions as the end of

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,420
talk what I'd like you to take away is

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,180
to understand what content can improve

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,300
the security of voice print

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,899
so what is voice print it's basically a

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,660
marable characteristic of a human voice

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,559
it is widely used in many scenarios so

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,980
the security of voice print is important

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,280
so a very nature question is that what

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,159
is the security of voice print in this

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,220
paper we focus on one aspect which is

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,340
distinctiveness that is given any two

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,220
user one will not be classified as the

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,159
other for instance in a family a normal

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,220
case is Alice as a mom can control the

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,500
smart speaker with Scranton's voice

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,400
print

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
and if the distinctiveness is low her

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,000
some part can impersonate Alice and use

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,100
the smart speaker to place block music

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,340
that's what we don't want to say

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,320
so what's determining the

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,560
distinctiveness of voice print

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,380
record the example in the previous what

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,140
Alice and her son says determines the

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,860
voice print so if she see another phrase

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,520
hey Siri does her son impersonate her

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,220
voice print this paper wants to answer

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,500
the question what types of speech

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,200
content can provide secure voice print

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,039
in terms of distinctiveness

43
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,520
we contrast a voice print security

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,819
scouting magic for example when you

45
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,819
input the speech content okay Siri the

46
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,040
scoring function will calculate the

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,140
security score give you a security level

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,379
and some suggestions and if you put hey

49
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,599
Google it will give you another score

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,540
and the referring to the suggestions we

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,760
can generate more secure words for voice

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,200
print

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,319
actually our security score is

54
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,060
statistically related to the

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,819
distinctiveness that means high security

56
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,519
score words like Okay Siri is voice

57
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,099
print will be low Force recognition rate

58
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,519
where first recognition contains false

59
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,940
acceptance and false rejection

60
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,120
a very typical scenario to use our Pro

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,879
score is Breakup Rewards

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,720
smart speaker vendors spent much efforts

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,440
finding good recap words and now most of

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
commercial wake-up words consist of one

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,120
or two words and with a prefix words

66
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,060
like OK Google but are they actually

67
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,580
able to provide enough distinctiveness

68
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,940
in voice print our metric can help them

69
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,000
to answer three important questions

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,700
whether their pickup was Secure why is

71
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,738
it secure and how to improve them

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,519
so how to contrast the scoring metric

73
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,340
we first investigate the automatic

74
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,400
speaker verification system referring to

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
the workflow we can find the security of

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,860
voice print is affected by all modules

77
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,319
including speakers which content

78
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,980
environments and ASP model so how to get

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,560
a pro score while the user provides

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,580
content but not the rest

81
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,560
the question actually to construct a

82
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,720
universal score it contains two

83
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,480
Challengers when is the score should

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,000
adapt to most of Mario speakers and

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,760
environment that means the score will

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,819
not tell you whether Alice and pop have

87
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,738
the same voice print in a certain model

88
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,100
it gives you statistical results

89
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,220
the other is the capability of handling

90
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,100
the most of speech content that means we

91
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,840
can't measure it from The Limited

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,220
corporate

93
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,620
so the basic idea to generate the

94
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,419
universal score is to use the

95
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,580
statistical results of a large scale

96
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,960
measurement

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,720
in the measurements for a given speech

98
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,940
content we can get the statistical

99
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,940
results of first recognition rate we

100
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,360
conduct our experiment with over 2 000

101
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,380
speakers and over 1 000 hour samples we

102
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,960
select three typical models including

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,720
classical and advanced models ivector X

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,180
vector and U level and I believe they

105
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,540
are represents most of cases

106
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,479
and two adapt to most of speech content

107
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,199
we use the basic unit forms to compose

108
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,500
of test audios with arbitrary content we

109
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,840
segments the whole order to phone clips

110
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,259
and the resembles them to test audios so

111
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,960
that over 40 minute orders contain all

112
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,699
kinds of forms

113
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,160
our methodology can be divided into

114
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,360
three key steps we first analyze what

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,759
phonetic factors we can derive from

116
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,120
speech content then to test the

117
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,280
relationship between the content and

118
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,280
distinctiveness we construct a data set

119
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
that have General enough content

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
and to conduct a model fitting on the

121
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,740
measurement results in this set to get

122
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,660
the true score

123
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,600
next we'll introduce the component of

124
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,360
the scoring metric Pro score

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
to study the effect of speech content we

126
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,820
look into it and represents speech

127
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,919
content with some features

128
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,380
since the phone is the basic unit of

129
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
language a sentence can be viewed as a

130
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,139
sequence of phones we Define four

131
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,660
phonetic factors which needs lens

132
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,139
elements and order we take OK Google as

133
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,600
an example gaming is from sequence and

134
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
phonetic factors

135
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,220
then with maps of magic factors to

136
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,440
security score

137
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,720
the scoring function have seven

138
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,020
variables including four fanatic factors

139
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,620
and three implicit variables they are

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,620
models bigger and environment

141
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,360
because output of function proof score

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,020
so far we get the input of pro score and

143
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,120
then we are going to parameterize the

144
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,400
function based on the statistical

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,580
results of first recognition rate

146
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,120
it consists of two parts one is the fact

147
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,060
of single Factor the other is which

148
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,880
factor is important

149
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,160
for richness we give the statistical

150
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
result of far and frr or audios with

151
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,220
different richness we can find as the

152
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,080
richness increases the security

153
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,539
increases as well and when the richness

154
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,000
is larger than 5 its impact is

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,699
negligible we can fit the impact as

156
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,520
Financial function we take hey Google

157
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,860
and Google as examples to show the

158
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,380
difference in bridgeness we can find hey

159
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,139
increases the richness by three that has

160
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,539
an improvement on security

161
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,180
so we get the finding the richness of

162
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,440
content should be at least five

163
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
for length the statistical result is

164
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,240
similar to that of richness the

165
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,580
difference is that when the lens is

166
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,419
larger than 30 its impact is negligible

167
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,000
we take cell 2 and cell 2 cell 2 as

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,580
examples it repeating the word events

169
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,460
increases the length by seven so we get

170
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,280
the finding the contents should be at

171
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,099
least the contain certain forms

172
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,520
for elements we give the sum of far and

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,060
frr on diverse forms we're having low

174
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,120
bar means high security we find some

175
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,460
magic phones they have low phosphate

176
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,020
condition rates and better for

177
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,060
generating voice print

178
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,360
for example it is better than all in

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,660
three typical models we take two prefix

180
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,799
words okay and hello as examples and

181
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,799
find o as a magic form so we had better

182
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,039
choose more secure forms

183
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,219
for the last Factor order we randomly

184
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,860
change the order of form a and Form B

185
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,459
order has almost no effect on security

186
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,620
we can't consider order in selecting

187
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,560
speech content we also analyze the

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,380
combination effect of two factors to

189
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,760
ranking them

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,339
we find elements is more important than

191
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,959
lens and the less important than

192
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,580
richness

193
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,220
according to this finding we're obtain

194
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,920
the true score function by data fitting

195
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,740
foreign

196
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,140
magic what can we do with it when

197
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,899
scenario is to help select the secure

198
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,640
recap Awards

199
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,399
first we answer the question whether the

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,160
current recap of words are secure we

201
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,680
assess 30 recup words from commercial

202
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,320
products and calculates the approved

203
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,560
score on ivector X vector and u11 models

204
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,600
respectively

205
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,660
we can guess the following finding the

206
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,820
first one we don't worry the richness

207
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
because almost all week upwards have

208
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,620
enough richness

209
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,019
even if the richness is enough the

210
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,180
length of most wake up words is

211
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,240
inadequate so we suggest repeating ones

212
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,100
to improve the security

213
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,640
for example repeating Alexa once as

214
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,100
Alexa Elixir it's security score

215
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,220
increases by about 1.

216
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,500
in addition we find an interesting

217
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,620
phenomena Chinese wake-up words prefer

218
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,320
repeating like so too so do it may

219
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,959
derive from linguist habits

220
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,540
but by coincidence that actually

221
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,760
improves the security

222
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,399
we find another interesting phenomena

223
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,940
most of wake up words in English use a

224
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,120
prefix word like hey or hello do they

225
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
have an impact on voice print security

226
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
We compare the average true score of 7

227
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,600
week upwards with or without prefix

228
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,120
words and calculates the Improvement in

229
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,880
score we find prefix words can increase

230
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,220
the pro score by around the 24 percent

231
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,579
because of its increase the length which

232
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,220
needs and Magic forms and the better

233
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,800
prefix Awards is okay

234
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
with the scrolling magic we developed a

235
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,899
voice print security scrolling tool and

236
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,600
make it public on the website here we

237
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,120
have a demo to demonstrate how to assess

238
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,300
and select pickup words possible users

239
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,399
of voice assistants such as

240
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
manufacturers and customers can select a

241
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
model and input words to generate the

242
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,579
score as an example we compare okay Siri

243
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,040
and hey Google mentioned in the title

244
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,399
and find okay Siri is better than hey

245
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,180
Google in generating secure voice print

246
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,540
to conclude in this work we proposed a

247
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,880
scoring metric called prus score to

248
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,220
quantify the security level of speech

249
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,220
content especially for wake up Awards we

250
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,860
assess 30 commercial wake-up words and

251
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,200
the reviews behind the reason whether it

252
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,779
is cure or not we developed an easy to

253
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,360
use scoring tool to help manufacturers

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,120
and users select the secure recap words

255
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,700
in the future we will study the effect

256
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,459
of essence and improve the transfability

257
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,040
of magic across murders

258
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,560
this is my presentation thanks for your

259
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,920
attention
