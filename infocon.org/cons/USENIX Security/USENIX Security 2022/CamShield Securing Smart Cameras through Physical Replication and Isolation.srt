1
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,740
this is Richardson Young from China

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,679
university in this talk I'm going to

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,900
introduce a new accessory device to

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,940
secure cameras

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,039
there are more and more visual sensors

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,680
around us we found them on smartphones

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,220
televisions vehicles and everywhere this

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,900
is probably because zero information

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,900
placed in central role to enable Smart

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,480
devices and smart home they bring

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,180
convenience to our daily life

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,120
but such convenience is that the cost of

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,700
risking the Privacy video information

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,579
can be very private many people like me

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,280
are very concerned about the cameras

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,800
from the ceiling what are they actually

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,100
doing well then upload the recordings to

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,160
somewhere or someone that I'm not aware

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,180
of

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,000
unfortunately these concerns are not

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
fictions

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,920
xiaomi a major smart device and probably

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,979
due to protocol box there are cameras by

24
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,920
leak images to other users

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,220
another similar case is nest camera it

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,040
is reported that some secondhand Nest

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,740
cameras can be viewed by their former

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,180
owner

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,000
of course the above issues were fixed

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
but the risks remain there are much more

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,820
undisclosed issues that can cause

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,119
privacy Bridge so when such a problem

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,579
haven't been addressed

34
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,520
let's consider typical use case the

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,159
camera of the device is recording for

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,680
some functional reasons the recordings

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,360
has to be uploaded to the internet

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,640
encryption is a common way to secure the

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
data outside of the camera

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
but it will fail if the camera operates

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,119
incorrectly or has been compromised

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,119
having a root of trust is a foundation

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
for encryption to take effect

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,119
if the camera has been completely taken

45
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
over it is hard to enforce its software

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
and Hardware to operate as expected

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,959
trusted Computing Hardware is a

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,599
potential solution to this problem but

49
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,819
it cannot be applied to camera already

50
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,800
in use

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,860
if there is no rule to trust then we can

52
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,440
choose to trust nothing it seems The

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,500
Meta CEO does not trust his laptop and

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,200
care about his privacy seriously

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,500
the camera of his laptop is taped and

56
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,239
disabled physically

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,700
however the approach is probably not

58
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,040
suitable for people who still need to

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
use their camera

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,560
we believe there shouldn't be such a

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,900
strange and trade-off between privacy

62
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,580
and functionality

63
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,040
and we want to find the solution that

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,379
can protect the zero privacy against

65
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,280
most threat and also retain the camera

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,800
functionalities as well

67
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,400
also similar to installing an external

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,580
lens it would be better if the solution

69
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,580
can be used to protect cameras already

70
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,080
in use

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,659
to achieve the goals we propose the

72
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,799
camshare system

73
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,140
to explain camshaft we focus on

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,599
discussion widely used smart security

75
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,319
cameras or smart cameras the smart

76
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,959
camera streams videos to a remote app

77
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,900
many smart camera vendors also provide

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,780
cloud services to improve the user

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,599
experience for example Cloud video

80
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,480
analysis helps the user to identify

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,900
strangers and tag activities in video

82
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,099
stream

83
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,739
the chemistry device is a physical

84
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,739
Shield that can be installed in front of

85
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,599
the smart camera

86
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,360
this small camera can only capture the

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,659
inside part of the camshaft this

88
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,239
prevented from capturing the actual

89
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,360
things to preserve the functionality of

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,120
this smart camera the cam Shield uses

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,000
its own visual sensor to record real

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,320
things

93
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,740
it encrypts the videos and transfers to

94
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,479
the user

95
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,780
simply put all approaches to physically

96
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,620
block the original camera and replicate

97
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,840
its functionalities

98
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,300
a following question is why the cam

99
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,360
Shield is more trustworthy than the

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,740
original camera

101
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,680
this is because we completely isolate

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,160
the cam shield from the smart camera and

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,020
the internet

104
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,020
it is a standalone device this can

105
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,300
effectively prevent it from many

106
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,840
practical attacks the second question is

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,780
how we are the protection affects the

108
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,240
functionality of the camera the cam

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,180
Shield uses its own camera to emulate

110
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,220
the original camera

111
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,040
to support Advanced features such as

112
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,120
Cloud analysis it offers an option to

113
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,520
the user to allow them to determine

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,620
which part of the information can be

115
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,940
disclosed to the card

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,160
cam Shield is a hardware soft workout

117
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,620
design system here is the hardware

118
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,680
architecture of the cam Shield twice the

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
rightmost camera is the Smart camera to

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,979
be secured we use the lens to focus the

121
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,919
smart camera to the screen the screen is

122
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,680
used as an output interface to convey

123
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
information from the commercial device

124
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,060
to the smart camera

125
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,120
the processing unit manages the screen

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
and the zero sensor

127
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,139
we prototype the camshaft Hardware with

128
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,020
commercial components and the 3D printed

129
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,160
case

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,460
it can be flexibly adjusted to fit

131
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,699
different cameras of course the form

132
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,520
factor can be further reduced and

133
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,580
Polished with uh with the engineering

134
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,800
efforts

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,320
inside the hardware runs the camera

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,639
software

137
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,860
the software wall can be divided into

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,259
two parts

139
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,560
it first encrypts the captured video

140
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,180
stream

141
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,539
then it uses special date pass to convey

142
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,539
the video stream to the smart camera and

143
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,639
then to the user over the internet

144
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,940
next we describe the two part in detail

145
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,940
cam Shield use encryption to secure

146
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,000
video stream one direct way is to

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
encrypt the entire frame but this would

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,180
completely destroy the video content and

149
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,699
disable Cloud analysis

150
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,780
another choice is partial encryption the

151
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,380
advantage is that it can leave partial

152
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,080
information for functional usage

153
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,319
for example the cloud can still infer

154
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,319
the Motions or gestures from the video

155
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,580
with the phase area encrypted

156
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,460
we adopt partial encryption in camshaft

157
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,060
it allows the user to specify the area

158
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,460
they would like to protect

159
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,160
these areas are called region of

160
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,740
Interest or Roi

161
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,620
we use the latest computer vision

162
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,440
algorithms to automatically detect the

163
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,000
rois in video frames then the errors are

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,560
encrypted accordingly

165
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,960
the user specifies the ROI areas by

166
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,660
configuring the policies of the camshaft

167
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,780
for example the time column and the

168
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,900
enable column determine when and whether

169
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,599
the corresponding Ry entry should be

170
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,460
protected

171
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,940
to configure the policies the user shows

172
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,099
a QR code that contains the

173
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,800
configuration message to the camshoot

174
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,979
camera

175
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,280
next we show how the encrypted video is

176
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,199
transmitted

177
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,620
for security reasons the capture device

178
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,440
is designed to be isolated from the

179
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,400
network

180
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,059
but there must be a way to stream the

181
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,399
video to the user

182
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,679
any two-way connections such as

183
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,219
Bluetooth USB cable might bring Bridges

184
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,480
to the isolation further as we also want

185
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,000
to secure smart cameras already in use

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,760
the installation shouldn't involve

187
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,000
Hardware or firmware modifications

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,300
to meet all these needs come here take

189
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,459
advantage of the zero sensing capability

190
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,220
of this smart camera to establish a

191
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,380
one-way date pass

192
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,220
that is the camshaft uses screen as the

193
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,680
transmitter and use visible light

194
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,740
signals to convey information to the

195
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,200
smart camera

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,600
at a high level the visible light

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,420
communication works like scanning or QR

198
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,560
code stream

199
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,399
the VLC streams looks like a QR code but

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,880
with colored blocks we use eight colors

201
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,519
rather than black and white to increase

202
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,260
the capacity

203
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,440
the VLC streams are displayed on cam

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,380
shared screen and captured by the smart

205
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,519
camera

206
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,860
through decoding the captured VLC

207
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,920
streams the loaded video stream can be

208
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,200
extracted

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,620
to decode VLC streams the first step is

210
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,600
to determine the location of color

211
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,540
blocks in practice two types of

212
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,779
distortions complicate the task

213
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,800
the first one is lens distortion pixel

214
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
spends out from the center of the image

215
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,500
the other one is chromatic Distortion

216
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,680
different colors Bend differently in the

217
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
captured image

218
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,120
to calibrate these distortions we

219
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,880
introduce Preamble frames before the

220
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,680
data frames

221
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,620
the grid Preamble is like a black and

222
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,800
white chessboard to help us to localize

223
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,700
actual Block locations and the color

224
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,940
palette Preamble allows to calibrate the

225
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,300
color channels then the color blocks can

226
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,600
be precisely localized and the bit can

227
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,240
be extracted

228
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,519
here is the Showcase of the entire

229
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,399
system the video stream is first

230
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,459
captured by the camera device and then

231
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,459
it is encoded into reality stream and

232
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,940
displays on each screen the Vanoss

233
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,760
stream will be captured by the smart

234
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,640
camera so the smart camera the VLC

235
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,700
stream is transmitted to the Cloud

236
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,779
Server and the camshod app after the LC

237
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,839
decoding the Cloud Server can obtain the

238
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,140
encrypted video and analyze the partial

239
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,459
information

240
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,180
at the same time the camshield app can

241
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,300
decode and decrypt to obtain the

242
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,079
original video

243
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,260
in this talk we propose the camshaft

244
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,019
system to secure visual sensing devices

245
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,800
its advantages are twofold first it is a

246
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,260
bulletin solution that tends the general

247
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,839
camera into a trusted one without

248
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,079
modifying Hardware in software

249
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,959
second the trustworthiness of the cam

250
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,440
Shield is based on physical isolation it

251
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,260
is a standalone device it's Computing

252
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,980
component not only logically but also

253
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,040
physically isolated from the network

254
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,339
such translation protected against most

255
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,279
practical attacks

256
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,440
thank you and I'm happy to take

257
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,740
questions
