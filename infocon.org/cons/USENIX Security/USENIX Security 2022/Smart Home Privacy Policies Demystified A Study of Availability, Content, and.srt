1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,200
research this work was completed when I

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,299
was working at William and Mary and in

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,980
this presentation I'll be talking about

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,199
our work on the study of smart home

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,699
privacy policies

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,500
so let me start with a brief background

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,480
of Smart Homes Smart Homes include

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,460
devices and services that mainly allows

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,980
remote control for example you can use

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,720
removable phones to interact with video

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,700
doorbells and door locks

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,860
so since there is some form of remote

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,300
interaction the data needs to be

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,160
transferred to the server and since the

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,079
data is being collected from from all of

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,000
these smart home devices it means that

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,620
it might collect information such as

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,899
when the user comes home from work or

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,660
when the user goes to sleep

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,460
so vendors often collect this

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,219
information to provide basic smart home

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,280
features or to just help with the basic

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,559
operations of devices but in this

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,120
process vendors might be processing

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,039
highly sensitive information of user

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,960
activities in the personal environment

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,540
of the users and this introduces the

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,580
risk of profiling for example an

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,560
insurance company might use the device

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
data from water sensor to infer

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,820
maintenance issue and then deny

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,119
insurance claims and even simple device

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,159
data collected from these devices can be

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,920
used in for sensitive information I'll

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,840
give you an example of a policy that we

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,780
analyzed and it is about the the vendor

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,759
uh basically provides uh energy

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,740
monitoring services and the excerpt

40
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,659
basically points out that the religious

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,240
affiliation and sexual orientation of

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
users can be inferred just based on

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,040
electricity uses at home

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,400
so at the minimum we want consumers to

45
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,320
be informed about what is happening with

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,659
their data and we want these policies to

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,799
be transparent

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,200
and the current mechanism of doing this

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
is through privacy policies so privacy

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,399
policy is a legally binding document

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,259
that conveys data handling practices of

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,200
the company and uh consumers can use it

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,259
to uh have informed decision about uh

54
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,240
with privacy in mind before purchasing

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,639
devices or before signing up for any

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,840
services

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,420
so swifting gears there's been a lot of

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,160
work in understanding privacy policies

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,020
for example people have looked at how

60
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,239
easy it is to understand or how

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,700
available the Privacy policies are or

62
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,260
they have also done the manual and

63
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,580
automated analysis to understand

64
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,680
different factors of privacy policies

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
such as contradictions within policies

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,660
vague statements users choices and so on

67
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,760
and recently there has been work in iot

68
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,099
privacy researchers have designed

69
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,959
privacy labels to make security

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,580
information as well as Privacy

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,680
Information more consumable and there

72
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,239
has also been work in understanding

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,420
privacy laws due to network Behavior

74
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,760
so in contrast to all of these Works our

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,580
work focuses on disclosive practices in

76
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,980
iot or smart and privacy policies and

77
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,900
agenda its insights for automated

78
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,120
analysis of iot privacy

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,819
and with this goal in mind we study we

80
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,519
study three aspects of smart home

81
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,620
privacy first we want to understand how

82
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,420
difficult it is for consumers to obtain

83
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,040
privacy policies that apply to Smart

84
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,379
Home devices we want to study how

85
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,000
precisely they convey the data handling

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,519
practices and we also want to study how

87
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,200
comprehensive they are in terms of

88
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,720
defining smart home product smart home

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,099
device data

90
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,560
so I'll briefly discuss our study

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,019
overview so we start with the

92
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,239
availability analysis where we try to

93
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,580
identify the smart home related privacy

94
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,819
policies then we just study the content

95
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,080
of the Privacy policies to understand

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,300
how precisely they discuss all the

97
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,220
device data that they collect and we

98
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,560
study the coverage to understand whether

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,140
they discuss device data related to all

100
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,340
of the devices that they actually

101
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,140
advertise in their website

102
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,840
so diving into availability analysis we

103
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,120
start by identifying a set of vendors

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
that provide Integrations with the top

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
seven popular smart home vendors we

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
identify 3678 into unique Integrations

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,940
and filtered it to get 1 365 websites

108
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,739
that means the vendors that have

109
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:05,940
websites

110
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,519
and from that we get a list of 596

111
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,860
vendors the confirmed smart home vendors

112
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,580
with that represent 2442 device types

113
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,279
and then from that list we were able to

114
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,399
identify 292 device privacy policies and

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,320
the way we did this is by scouring

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,639
through different sources the

117
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,500
methodology is to First Look at the

118
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,660
vendor website and look for privacy

119
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,639
policy to see if they're discussing uh

120
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,160
smart home devices if that fails then we

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,139
look at the Google search just perform a

122
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,180
Google search to see if we're missing

123
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,740
anything or if we're missing some of the

124
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,139
links and if that fails then we go to

125
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,479
Google Play store and see the privacy

126
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
policy link and if everything fails we

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
install the app and try to register an

128
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
account

129
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,460
So based on this we find that uh getting

130
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,560
to privacy policies is difficult first

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,540
of all we find more than 10 of the cases

132
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,100
they do not even provide any privacy

133
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,360
policies

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
um for the cases where they do provide

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,139
privacy policies almost half of them do

136
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,880
not talk about smart home device data

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
which is really surprising and even when

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,860
we could find Smart Home related privacy

139
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,660
policies it was not easy because we have

140
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,220
to jump through multiple Hoops just to

141
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,380
get to those privacy policies it's not

142
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,120
in the same location

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,460
and although it seems that we have come

144
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,860
far we also found cases where vendors do

145
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,240
not even make their website privacy

146
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,400
policies easily available

147
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,979
so let me give you an example of one of

148
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,780
the vendors that represents most of the

149
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,940
analysis that we did this is the vendor

150
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,020
which is one of the Fortune 100

151
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,720
companies so we follow the same process

152
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,699
we started with a vendor website it only

153
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,039
contained website policy then we

154
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,740
performed the Google search

155
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,539
and uh instead of getting another

156
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,039
privacy policy we actually find another

157
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,680
website related to the vendor then we

158
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,660
look at the Google Play Store we found

159
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,759
multiple apps and surprisingly we found

160
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,039
some of the apps a link to 404 error for

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,320
the Privacy policies and finally we

162
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,259
executed uh the app and in one of those

163
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,600
apps we were able to actually find the

164
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,180
device privacy policy so when we looked

165
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,639
at it further we also found that for the

166
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,620
website policy 2 there was a supplement

167
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,500
CCPA supplement link and it required us

168
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,080
to download Word document and that did

169
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
indeed discuss some of the device data

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,160
and considering the fact that users

171
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,840
don't even read the privacy policy that

172
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,060
is given to them uh expecting them to

173
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,160
download a document and reading it is

174
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,199
inconceivable

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,300
so let's move on to the content analysis

176
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,280
the goal here is to understand how

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,800
precisely they discuss device data so we

178
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,720
start by defining labels Consulting with

179
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,280
the prior work in this domain as well as

180
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,020
privacy regulations such as CCPA and

181
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,500
gdpr and we identified two kinds of

182
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,240
labels document labels and content

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,919
labels document labels to get the

184
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,039
general metadata of the general metadata

185
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,600
of the Privacy policies and content

186
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,340
labels where we annotated set of

187
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,960
statements to identify collection

188
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,539
sharing statements and so on

189
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,819
So based on the content analysis finding

190
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,979
we find a reasonable number of cases

191
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,020
where they just discuss broad terms to

192
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,300
Define device data for example users

193
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,919
information would be considered broad

194
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,979
whereas uh temperature information

195
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,000
collected from thermostat would be

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,819
considered precise

197
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,319
we also found that existing

198
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,759
state-of-the-art policy analysis

199
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,800
technique uh incorrectly reason about

200
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,199
most of the Privacy policies and this is

201
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,060
because of the structural and semantic

202
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,060
intricacies and that is why we opted for

203
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,759
the semi-automated approach

204
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,620
uh we found cases where vendors were

205
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,060
just mentioning that they do not collect

206
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,680
any information but since these are

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,780
smart home devices uh it comes the

208
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,520
question of what collection actually

209
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,960
means

210
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,759
um and in terms of sharing practices

211
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,800
vendors were often not clear they were

212
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
just mentioning uh they were sharing the

213
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,720
device data to certain third parties but

214
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,580
they were not specific about what

215
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,160
categories they're talking about and the

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,319
same with with whom they are sharing the

217
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,860
device data they were not uh very clear

218
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,020
and some did not even discuss sharing at

219
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,340
all

220
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,979
so finally uh we also performed the

221
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,680
coverage analysis the goal again here is

222
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,840
to understand uh

223
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,180
whether the vendors discuss device data

224
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,099
related to all of the devices that they

225
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,380
advertise in the website so we started

226
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,419
by building vendor device map basically

227
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,000
mapping all of the vendors with all of

228
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
the devices that they advertise in the

229
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,720
website and we use that to understand

230
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,819
the coverage basically comparing it with

231
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,680
the privacy policy to see if they're

232
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,180
talking about all the devices that they

233
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,220
advertise

234
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,860
So based on the coverage analysis we

235
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,899
found that 25 of the Privacy policies

236
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,179
which we said that they are precise they

237
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,219
did they only discuss subset of their

238
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,380
available devices

239
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,360
another interesting thing that we noted

240
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,339
was that vendors do not differentiate

241
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,899
their privacy disclosures for devices

242
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,180
that produce similar data but have

243
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,580
vastly different privacy implications so

244
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,980
an example can be like video information

245
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,140
collected from baby monitor versus video

246
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,880
information collected from outdoor

247
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,980
cameras so vendors would just mention

248
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,019
that video information is collected but

249
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,820
definitely we do not want the same video

250
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,440
information to go to certain third

251
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,180
parties it has different privacy

252
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,580
implications

253
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,980
and we found cases where vendors just

254
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,600
discuss irrelevant data this might just

255
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,580
be because they're using remnants from

256
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,560
policy templates or they're updating the

257
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,060
processes

258
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,040
and another interesting thing that we

259
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
noted and was only possible because we

260
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,540
were doing semi-automated analysis is

261
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,640
that uh they were the vendors that

262
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,440
previously we thought were using broad

263
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,779
terms were actually precise because they

264
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,360
were only selling one uh one type of

265
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,700
device and this speaks further to the

266
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,920
contextual analysis needed for this kind

267
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,959
of analysis

268
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,700
so furthermore we also wanted to

269
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,339
evaluate the impact basically to see how

270
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,860
popular these uh devices are that we

271
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,320
analyze so we looked at Google Play

272
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Google Play Store as well as Amazon to

273
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,899
get some idea of popularity and we see

274
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,519
that vendors have at least 200k

275
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,080
downloads on Google Play and at least

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,779
354 Amazon ratings for most of our

277
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,200
findings on availability analysis

278
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
furthermore we also looked at the Amazon

279
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
badges so Amazon stores award and

280
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,140
Amazon's bestseller award and we see

281
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,839
that there is at least one bestseller uh

282
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,300
product and at least nine Amazon's

283
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,920
Choice Awards so this is for

284
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,779
availability findings and we repeated

285
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,180
this experiment for both content and

286
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,100
coverage findings and as you can see

287
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,880
they have very similar results

288
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,880
and finally we also uh informed all of

289
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,220
our vendors about our findings uh we see

290
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,959
that most we saw that most of the

291
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,700
vendors were in the process of updating

292
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,100
their privacy policies uh or they were

293
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,839
just uh they provided clarifications

294
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
actually most of the times we really we

295
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,240
just received uh automated replies and

296
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,180
never got anything back from them and

297
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,860
some just pointed us to wrong privacy

298
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,279
policies

299
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,140
so talking about the takeaways

300
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,120
um there needs to be some uh standard

301
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
distribution of policies so you cannot

302
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,500
just keep blaming vendors because we saw

303
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,180
that based on our interacts and vendors

304
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,399
are actually trying to trying to make

305
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,320
things easier for consumers so they're

306
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,300
not always trying to deceive but they

307
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,740
just don't know since smart home is a

308
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,680
new domain it's uh not clear where they

309
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,720
should be putting those privacy policies

310
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,000
second they need to be Improvement in

311
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
precision and completeness smart home is

312
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,720
a new domain so a device specific

313
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,579
privacy policies It's A New Concept so

314
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,279
they're getting uh acquainted to it but

315
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,779
they need there needs to be this

316
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,620
Improvement to properly inform consumers

317
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,600
and finally there needs to be tool

318
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
enabled effective standards and

319
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,560
practices so we all know we don't really

320
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,019
read privacy policies and because of

321
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,640
introduction of new regulations the

322
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,140
Privacy policies are getting longer and

323
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,480
longer and we believe that it makes more

324
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,940
sense for

325
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,860
vendors to Consumers to have some tools

326
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,660
that they can use to extract specific

327
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,060
information from privacy policies to get

328
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,220
properly informed about all of the

329
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,959
Privacy practices

330
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,060
so with that I conclude my presentation

331
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,620
thank you

332
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,680
[Applause]

333
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
so much for the very interesting

334
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,820
presentation yeah I guess we already

335
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,519
have questions yeah so thanks for the

336
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,339
interesting presentation so uh looks

337
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,140
like it's quite a disaster there with

338
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,480
these privacy policies but from a gdpr

339
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,940
perspective having your policies only

340
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,100
one thing but it would have to have an

341
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,620
informed and voluntary concept of the

342
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,100
user and even if I deny the content the

343
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,140
there's a legal debate whether than the

344
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,079
device

345
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,420
must still be operational to some extent

346
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,800
right so even if I deny my content uh

347
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
the device should not become worthless

348
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
so have you also looked into the

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,860
constant mechanisms and what would be

350
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,459
the consequences of denying the consent

351
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:56,399
so in terms of privacy policy so this is

352
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
our starting work I haven't specifically

353
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,620
look at consent but privacy policies are

354
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,160
in itself uh like constant mechanism so

355
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,620
if you are purchasing a device you are

356
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,480
being informed about what is happening

357
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,579
what is going to happen with you so that

358
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,320
that's where informed consent comes in

359
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,899
so we are considering these privacy

360
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,000
policies as a mechanism to provide

361
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,579
provide informed consent but in terms of

362
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,820
like after I buy a device and to like

363
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,860
follow up with consent I haven't really

364
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,139
performed that analysis but we are

365
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,880
looking at all these regulations as well
