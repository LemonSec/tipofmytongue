1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,380
good morning everybody today I'll be

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,019
talking about the impact of router-based

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,000
load balancing on DNS censorship

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,900
measurement

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,160
so let's talk about censorship

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,260
measurement so censorship affects

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,760
hundreds of countries and billions of

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,039
people in response censorship

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,380
measurement Studies have been produced

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,359
that try to answer various questions

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
about censorship like what is being

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,019
censored how is it being censored how

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,520
does censorship change with time things

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,420
like this

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,780
now many of the censorship Works use

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,219
this technique called remote measurement

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,379
in which they send sensitive packets

19
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,480
from outside the country being measured

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,879
into the country that is experiencing

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,100
censorship and they use the results to

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,780
infer the presence or absence of

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,879
censorship now this is really convenient

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,379
because it requires no user

25
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,420
participation inside the country

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,940
now many of this prior work has largely

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,219
focused on the scale of censorship but

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,100
then they have also noticed some forms

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,159
of non-determinism in the results this

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,780
can be in the form of absence of

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,760
censorship when you really are expecting

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,040
censorship to be there but this has not

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,020
been explored in great detail

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,340
so let's look at some of the

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,860
non-determinism seen so here is a graph

36
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
from our prior work that on DNS

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,780
sensitive measurement that shows the

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,759
inconsistencies in measured censorship

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
so here we observe this kind of smearing

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,580
effect happening which indicates some

41
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,740
kind of heterogeneity in The observed

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,840
censorship now this was originally

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,780
speculated to be because of some form of

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,119
geolocation errors or a feature of the

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,860
great firewall things like this but what

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,360
is really happening here

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
so additionally other works have also

48
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,619
noticed non-determinism in the form of

49
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,020
varying levels of censorship just based

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,540
on changing the probes

51
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,820
and also sometimes the reset packets

52
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,700
could not uh successfully tear down a

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,340
sensitive connection for certain uh

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,560
series of clients and servers

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,020
in fact some prior work have also

56
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,540
speculated that these non-determinisms

57
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,300
can be caused by changes in the route

58
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,940
between experiments but from prior work

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,360
we know that given a fixed source of

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,099
parameters the route taken by a packet

61
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,140
is very stable with time so what is

62
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,640
going on here

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,340
so let us look at a potential cost for

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,739
this non-determinism so something well

65
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,660
understood in the networking community

66
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,180
and completely unrelated to any form of

67
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,239
censorship measurement is this technique

68
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,040
is this phenomenon called equal cost

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,819
multipath routing now this Augustine at

70
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,680
all was one of the first Works to

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,959
explore this in great detail and they

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,120
found that in in their work from 2010

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,160
they found that up to 72 percent of the

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,680
packs in their experiment went through

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,260
at least one road balancing router now

76
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,420
this is from 2010 and the numbers have

77
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,700
only increased with time and prior like

78
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,500
recent work shows that

79
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,160
now they also found the fields that are

80
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,099
responsible for uh router load balancing

81
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,560
decisions let's take a second to look at

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,540
a particularly focus on these two Fields

83
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,879
The Source IP and the source part so

84
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,340
essentially randomized selection of the

85
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,280
source Port can significantly

86
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,720
potentially change the path taken by a

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
packet

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,920
now given this knowledge how does this

89
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,220
intersect with a censorship measurement

90
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,739
so this is where we come in so our work

91
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,680
really explores the impact of equal cost

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,860
multipath load balancing or routing on

93
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,239
the results of DNS censorship

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,140
measurement

95
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,540
so here is an example of the kind of

96
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,000
behavior we are looking for here are two

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,120
DNS DNS queries to the same destination

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,659
with the same sensitive domain but the

99
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,340
only difference is in the source IPA

100
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,200
these are two Source IPS in the same

101
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,379
subnet now the first question is can

102
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,659
these two different queries produce

103
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,120
different network paths now prior work

104
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,459
has shown that they do but then does it

105
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,379
apply for DNS censorship measurement the

106
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,519
answer is yes

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,099
and do these changes in path correspond

108
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,379
to changes in censorship results the

109
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,599
answer to this shockingly is also yes

110
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,879
and finally we want to understand why

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,279
this phenomenon is taking place

112
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,339
to this end we build and deploy breadcom

113
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,500
ah which is a methodology and Associated

114
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,780
tool that is able to find changes in

115
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,000
censorship as a consequence of changing

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,979
Source parameters especially the source

117
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,199
IP and the source port

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,759
so let's briefly look at the

119
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,460
architecture of breadcrumb so given a

120
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,620
set of input parameters these could be

121
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,500
destinations domains and Source IP and

122
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,660
Source board breadcrumb produces a

123
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,000
sensitive DNS query packets for all of

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,580
these combinations and then sends them

125
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,699
out to the internet and then it uses the

126
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,620
replies obtained to infer the presence

127
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,080
or absence of censorship now given the

128
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,759
prevalence of packet loss in the

129
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,340
internet

130
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,320
obtaining the absence of censorship is a

131
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,180
challenging problem to this end

132
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,520
breadcrumb uses an iterative approach

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
between the analysis and the measurement

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,960
to obtain stable results now this is

135
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,259
explained in more detail in the paper

136
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:15,380
but I will move on in The Intercept time

137
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,300
in addition we also Implement a DNS

138
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,400
trace route tool that is able to build

139
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
the network graph taken by a DNS

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
measurement packet

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,539
so let's now look at the research

142
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,180
questions that motivate our work so we

143
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,060
first want to answer whether changing a

144
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,460
source board or Source IP causes change

145
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,740
in the path taken by a DNS measurement

146
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,960
packet priorberg has shown this for

147
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,080
General uh cases but then does it apply

148
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,840
for DNS measurement packets and then do

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,180
these changing paths actually produce

150
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,340
different censorship results

151
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,820
and then do any of the particular Source

152
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,100
IP or Source Port cause more changes in

153
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,440
censorship finally we want to see if

154
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,840
these sensitive changes are prevalent

155
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,660
across a wider set of sensitive domains

156
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,940
now let's focus in the interest of time

157
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,740
we will focus on question research

158
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,840
questions two and three in this talk but

159
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,880
the results from the other research

160
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,800
questions are presented in the paper

161
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,320
okay so does varying The Source IP and

162
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,600
the source Port cost changes in

163
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,919
sensitive results the answer is

164
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,500
absolutely yes in fact we observe that

165
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,979
37 of the destinations across 56 of the

166
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,440
ass observed change in uh measured

167
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,960
censorship as a consequence of changing

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,060
Source parameters now here on the right

169
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,319
we have a CDF of the amount of change

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,520
for all the destinations that we

171
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,340
measured uh something to observe is this

172
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,919
effect is cumulative across multiple

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,259
parameters The Source IP The Source port

174
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,300
and the destination IP so the problem

175
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,460
just gets worse with scale as you

176
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,400
increase the scale of the experiment and

177
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,620
also uh something to note is a vast

178
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,960
majority of these changes are All or

179
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,660
Nothing what I mean by that is for a

180
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,639
single destination a certain set of

181
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,259
source parameters always produce

182
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,240
censorship across all the domains that

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,940
we test but then for some set of source

184
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,800
parameters this they produce no

185
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,720
censorship for any sensitive domain that

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,419
we measure so this indicates some form

187
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,699
of routing around censorship behavior

188
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,740
that is happening

189
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,220
so now let's look at ah now that we know

190
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,080
that Source IPS and Source Port cause

191
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,840
change like do any particular Source IP

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,940
or Source produce more or less changes

193
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,919
so here on the right we have a

194
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,220
distribution of source IPS in our

195
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,900
experiment that cost changes in

196
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,660
censorship across all destinations and

197
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,780
the color the bands are colored by the

198
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,120
last three bits of the last octet of the

199
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,419
source IP so right off the bat we notice

200
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,520
that changes are not uniformly

201
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,500
distributed across all the source IPS

202
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,560
that we tested in fact additionally they

203
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,500
correlate to some form of bit pattern of

204
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,800
the source IP so and also we know from

205
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,199
router documentations that routers are

206
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,780
known to use the last n Bits of the

207
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,660
source and destination IP to perform

208
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,120
sense to perform routing decisions now

209
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,500
this is a this is one thing where we can

210
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,539
show that known routing Behavior has

211
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,819
cost changes in censorship

212
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,699
now let us look at a more concrete uh

213
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,400
case study example so here we have a

214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,500
network graph produced using our DNS

215
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,259
tracero Tool uh for Source all the

216
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,880
source parameters that produced

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,779
sensitive results for one destination

218
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,599
here colored in red is the node that is

219
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,099
performing the censorship

220
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,440
now let's look at the same network graph

221
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,779
for the same destination but for Source

222
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,880
IPS that produced Source IP and Source

223
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,160
ports that produced no censorship so

224
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,959
again right off the bat we noticed

225
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,640
something interesting these two graphs

226
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,740
are significantly different the network

227
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,540
paths so on the right we observe that

228
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,760
the path taken by the packet does not

229
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,380
pass through the node performing the

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,019
censorship so this further indicates

231
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,660
that this is some form of routing around

232
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,640
censorship that is happening and

233
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,760
additionally it shows that just changing

234
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
simply changing the source parameter of

235
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,380
the measurement packet can cause changes

236
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,300
in the network path which causes changes

237
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,700
in the censorship results

238
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,100
so let's summarize all the results from

239
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,500
our talk here today so we have shown

240
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,839
that changing uh the source parameter

241
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,660
Source IP and Source Port can change uh

242
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,880
the packet path taken by a DNS

243
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,519
measurement packet and in turn these

244
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,440
changes in the path can result in

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,320
changes in censorship results uh with up

246
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,680
to 37 of the destinations across 56

247
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,560
percent of the ass affected and we also

248
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,779
found interesting correlations between

249
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,380
the changes in censorship and the bit

250
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,000
patterns in the source and destination

251
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,140
IP

252
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,500
and finally we saw a concrete example of

253
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,720
network with network graphs which show

254
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,060
that changes in Source parameters can

255
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,700
cause changes in path which can cause

256
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,680
changes in censorship

257
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,440
okay so finally let me summarize uh we

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,420
learned a lot during this study so we

259
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,920
want to give some recommendations and

260
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,660
takeaways for future censorship

261
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,940
measurement tools so let's start with

262
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,500
selecting Source parameters so we

263
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,540
clearly saw that there was a correlation

264
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,060
between Source IP and changes in

265
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,459
censorship so these studies must

266
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,920
carefully select Source IP based on the

267
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,399
bit diversity of the last n Bits in

268
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,320
addition in our study the changes in

269
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,300
censorship were randomly distributed

270
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,820
across Source ports but this may not be

271
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,360
true for all study so ah these

272
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,579
researchers must also carefully select

273
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,220
Source Port randomly from the ephemeral

274
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,459
Port range ah in addition to Source IP

275
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,459
destination IPS must also be selected uh

276
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,740
based on the bit diversity of the last n

277
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,899
Bits of the destination IP

278
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,600
and packet loss is something we

279
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,160
discovered is very prevalent on the

280
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,700
internet and this can manifest in the

281
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,040
form of absence of censorship so these

282
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
studies must be careful to perform like

283
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,680
repetition to establish stability

284
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,560
finally any study that performs a path

285
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,200
reconstruction must be careful to

286
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,600
account for router load balancing when

287
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,300
they perform these studies and our DNA

288
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,100
stressed out tool is something that they

289
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,380
can use to perform this

290
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,720
thank you and I'll open for any

291
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,959
questions
