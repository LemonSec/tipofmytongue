1
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,219
my research mainly focuses on cyber

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,160
security AI ml Data Mining and health

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,740
intelligence especially building the

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,900
Innovative links between Ai and security

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,600
to Advanced Techniques for intelligent

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,580
manual production and adversary machine

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,820
learning in addition by harnessing data

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,460
Revolution we also aim to investigate

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,980
the underground ecosystem focusing on

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,500
crimeware and crimeware as a service

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,739
so uh during the prolonged pandemic or

12
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,079
even post-pandemic as the global

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,840
population has transformed to work from

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,440
home or Highway malls accordingly Cyber

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,620
attack have have also pivoted including

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,800
data breach Network infiltration

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,960
identity shift and malware attack for

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,739
example it was estimated that about 386

19
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,920
million euro records from 18 different

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,099
companies were stolen in 2020 and among

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,200
them some of the most recognized Twitter

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,780
account were also compromised to

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,720
fraudulentary trees about Bitcoin and

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,760
another example is that ransomware

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,540
attack has increased dramatically the

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,880
asthmaticals of ransomware attack nearly

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,119
doubled in 2020 reaching 20 billion

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,840
dollars so to protect legitimate users

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,320
against the evolving Cyber attack many

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,080
of like a existing Studies have focused

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,960
on AI or machine learning models to

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,360
provide automatic detection of the

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,180
attacks however in addition to the

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,880
detection results we will expect Canon

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,140
how to tell us why it predicted as an

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,600
attack can it further provide the

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,299
contextual information

38
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,280
causality analysis on system auditing

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,159
data has emerged as a promising research

40
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,100
direction for attack investigation and

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,399
in this work particularly given an POI

42
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,580
event such as an alert file on a

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,580
malicious fire creation we aim to build

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,640
a dependency graph to conduct chorality

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,340
analysis to reveal the attack sequence

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,280
so in today's like a presentation that

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,980
is brought together all the technical

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,440
challenges are and how we propose our

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,099
methodology to achieve this goal then I

50
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,379
would like to share together with all of

51
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,900
us you guys are

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,260
by the attack in the cyber's world in

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,560
2011 one occurred affected the thousands

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,099
of computers in more than 115 countries

55
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,519
in the spring of the

56
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,099
2018 several criminals compromised

57
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,440
several computer networks with Atlanta

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,680
City Hall to the ransomware attack this

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
attack affected up to 60 million people

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,900
in this may Colonial pipelines was

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,360
attacked by the by the attacker group

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,840
Dark Side the company decided to pay to

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,900
pay 4.4 million dollars to recover the

64
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,540
system within several hours after the

65
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,500
attack

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,379
under these serious situations we have

67
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,959
to ask why these attacks are so hard to

68
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,700
prevent and investigate

69
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,340
here's the reasons the Cyber attack

70
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,379
usually contains multiple steps first

71
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,080
the attackers will try to compromise our

72
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,260
our system second the attacker may try

73
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,239
to effect more computers in the same

74
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,120
network later the attacker will try to

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,819
escalate his system privileged to obtain

76
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,340
users credentials I want to point out

77
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,680
two things about attackers the tax

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,620
behaviors for this behaviors some of

79
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,780
them looks quite normal just like legal

80
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,959
users daily behaviors in other words not

81
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,200
all attack steps looks suspicious second

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
the attack may keep stealthy for a

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,700
certain time to finish the whole attack

84
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,900
to detect and investigate these double

85
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,978
attacks researchers first create a Ube

86
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,720
created system monitoring system to

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,358
collect system traces then we can build

88
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,880
a huge temporary graph to visualize the

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,419
system traces in this graph the nodes

90
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,699
are processed fair and the network

91
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,460
connections The Edge represents

92
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,500
different system in one like file read

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,680
or write in this graph we can do forward

94
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,639
and backward analysis about POI in once

95
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,320
POI in what meets the point of interest

96
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,380
in what this in what is usually detected

97
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,419
by a normally detection tools or

98
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,639
observed by the user

99
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,300
the left bottom figures

100
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,759
is a backward Clarity analysis examples

101
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,360
by the backward and Analysis we can know

102
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,300
how does this event happens the left

103
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,160
bottom figures of forward Clarity

104
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,139
analysis example but the forward

105
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,660
analysis we can know with what other

106
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,720
system entity may be affected by the

107
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,620
input in want

108
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,860
but existing Solutions about security

109
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,900
analysis have verbal waste

110
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,240
implementations many irrelevance

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,240
dependencies are included into the graph

112
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,580
this cause the dependency graph could be

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,759
gigantic typically containing more than

114
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,060
tons turns out on 100 000 edges

115
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,259
this is an example of real Attack the

116
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,560
attack related Edge is 11. which are

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
buried in about three millions

118
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,600
non-critical edges this example shows

119
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,220
how hard to get the contextual

120
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,919
information of the POI in once it's just

121
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,960
like finding a needle in a half deck

122
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
according to our observations we

123
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,500
summarize three technical challenges of

124
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,620
the attack investigations first due to

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,080
the complexity of modern system the

126
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,900
dependency group is huge second the

127
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,960
growth reductions based on single

128
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,240
features is hard to address diverse

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,539
attack scenarios third the method based

130
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,819
on heuristic rules and execution profile

131
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,819
are not accurate and hard to apply on

132
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,840
the large scale

133
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,580
to solve the mesh in the challenges we

134
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,780
have

135
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,199
we have we have 2K in size although

136
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,060
critical edges are buried in many

137
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,720
non-critical edges this critical exhibit

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,699
a different set of properties and more

139
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,039
related to the POI in white

140
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,340
second a POI in one is often caused by a

141
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,740
few sources we Define this attack

142
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,380
related source as the attack entries

143
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,080
this attack entries are buried in other

144
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,460
irrelevant entry nodes

145
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,819
based on our key insights we propose

146
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,819
Deep Impact a normal framework that

147
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,240
facilities attack investigations by

148
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,860
identifying critical edges and attack

149
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,740
entries in large dependency growth

150
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,960
Deep Impact make following contributions

151
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,539
will propose a new dependency with

152
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,360
computations to address their worth

153
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,819
attack scenarios which solve the Second

154
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,840
Challenge

155
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,819
according to our

156
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,120
second insights the Deep Impact does a

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,819
dependency impact back propagations and

158
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,620
entering of the ranking to find the

159
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,539
attack entries in the large dependency

160
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,419
graph turn deep impacters of forward

161
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,039
Clarity analysis for the critical

162
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,620
component identifications

163
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,020
the size of critical components is much

164
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,699
smaller than the original dependency

165
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,580
group and the contestable most critical

166
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,120
edges

167
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,880
now we have know what is Deep Impact I

168
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,580
will follow further explain how it works

169
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,680
the workflow of people impact can be

170
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,620
divided into three different phases the

171
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,539
goal of physics one is to generate a

172
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,599
dependency graph in the second phases if

173
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,360
impact finished with computations in

174
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,180
Phase 3 big impact identifies the

175
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,259
critical components

176
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,958
in Phase One Deep Impact takes pure

177
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,179
Island and the system of audit data as

178
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,440
inputs

179
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,140
the relative impact as a backward cavity

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,480
analysis to generate a dependency growth

181
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,380
in phase two Deep Impact will merge The

182
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Perennial edges between two nodes then

183
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,420
according to the system auditing data

184
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,760
calculate weights for each edges based

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,860
on these three features which are

186
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,200
designed to mirror the data flow

187
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,660
relevance temporary relevance and the

188
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,220
Constitutional ratio

189
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,459
foreign

190
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,980
dependency

191
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,200
impact back Publications back propagates

192
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,660
the dependency score from the POI inward

193
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,660
after this step every note in this

194
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,760
dependency graph will have a dependency

195
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,040
score which is decided by The Edge

196
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,560
weight then it does an antonym of

197
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,140
ranking based on the score at last

198
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,360
people impact the support cavity

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,000
analysis to identify critical components

200
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,600
thank you

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,060
in r21 we aim to evaluate the Deep

202
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,000
impacts in revealing attack sequences

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
with comparative impact with four first

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
stage of our approaches these approaches

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,740
depend on the heuristic rules and the

206
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,540
executing profile to reduce the

207
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,640
dependency growth size and the fin fun

208
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,000
attack related edges and nodes from the

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,380
numbers marked in the Square

210
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,820
we can see the growth size process by

211
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,920
Deep Impact is much smaller than the

212
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,800
other approaches more specifically the

213
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
growth process by Deep Impact is 72

214
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
times smaller than the second best

215
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
results

216
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,899
foreign

217
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,140
we already know Deep Impact will do

218
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,060
forward charity analysis

219
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,300
from top ranked entry notes in iq2 we

220
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,399
want to answer how many entry nodes

221
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,200
should we choose to do this forward

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,140
currency analysis from these two figures

223
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,380
we can clearly see it we can clearly see

224
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,680
two Tendencies the small entry nodes can

225
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,899
avoid incorrectly filtered out critical

226
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,779
edges which decrease the post connective

227
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,200
rate but the final output

228
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,700
will also keep more in related age edges

229
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,579
which increase the false positive rate

230
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,279
based on these observations we suggest

231
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,800
that the user of Deep Impact stop adding

232
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,339
top ranked entry nodes when including

233
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,660
one more entry notes for forward

234
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,420
analysis will result in a significant

235
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,240
size increase of the critical components

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,680
in accurate 3 we evaluate the Deep

237
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,740
Impact in revealing attack entries

238
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,440
the ranking result of EP impact is much

239
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,380
better than four other Baseline methods

240
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,300
these numbers mean still impact

241
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
averagely will rank the attack related

242
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,160
entries to the very high position

243
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,420
in summary Deep Impact understands the

244
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,820
screen discriminative dependency rates

245
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,100
to edges for revealing critical areas

246
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,160
and computes and propagates

247
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,500
dependency impact to entry nodes for

248
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,260
revealing attack entries compare with

249
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,959
other approaches Deep Impact utilize

250
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,640
three features to handle different

251
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,320
attack scenarios

252
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,079
at the same times the graph reduction

253
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,380
down by it impacts or voice the usage of

254
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,740
heuristic rules and execution profile by

255
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,839
further performing forward Clarity

256
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,420
analysis from the top ranked entry nodes

257
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,480
Deep Impact only preserve attack related

258
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,620
entries

259
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,899
evaluation results demonstrate the

260
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,760
effectiveness of steep impact in

261
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,220
filtering out irrelevant entries which

262
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,320
effectively address the first challenge

263
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,620
