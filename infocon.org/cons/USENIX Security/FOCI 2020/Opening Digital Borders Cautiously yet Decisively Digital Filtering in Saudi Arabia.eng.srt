00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,000
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
it's my pleasure to present our paper

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,719
where we show a longitudinal study

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,720
about what we define digital filtering

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,480
in saudi arabia

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
we use the term digital filtering to

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
include both mobile applications and

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,640
website access

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
in this paper i had the pleasure to work

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,439
with two of the best minds in the field

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,159
from uc riverside professors mihalis

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,960
faluxos

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,399
and na el abu ghazali

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
saudi arabia is often considered to be

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
one of the most conservative countries

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
in the world

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
this for sure influences digital

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,879
filtering in the country

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,360
the filtering decisions are motivated by

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,039
the government's desire

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,800
to protect the values of the saudi

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,520
society which center around islam

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,559
the official religion of the country

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
this is in addition to implementing

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,239
national security and public safety

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,718
policies

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240
however in the last years saudi arabia

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,439
has undergone significant

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,280
socio-political challenges

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
such as allowing women to drive and

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
allowing the operation of movie theaters

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
for the first time in decades

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
these changes also combined with

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
significant political events in the

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,799
region

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,119
which seem to have brought forward a

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,200
more progressive approach in regards to

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,240
accessing the internet

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,799
specifically these changes concise with

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,960
the start of the execution of the saudi

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,600
arabia's

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,799
national vision 2030 that was announced

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,200
back

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
in april 2016 by the crown brands

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,960
mohammed nisalman

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
this vision was nationally adopted as a

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,240
road map for

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,880
economic and developmental projects

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,399
across all fields

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,079
with the stated objectives of

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,839
modernization and openness

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
given both the significant social

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,600
changes

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,399
and the geopolitical events a natural

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,399
question is whether such events

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,399
translate into changes in the digital

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,679
filtering policies

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,440
in saudi arabia there are few studies

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
that are older and less comprehensive

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
than our work

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
focusing on saudi arabia while there are

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
several studies of internet filtering in

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,599
other countries

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,760
to the best of our knowledge this paper

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
represents the first systematic

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
longitudinal study of digital filtering

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
in saudi arabia

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,480
here i provide the outline of this talk

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,239
so first i will go briefly on the

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,920
background of the internet in saudi

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
arabia

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,920
then i will highlight our contributions

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,720
after that

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,120
i will present the methodology we used

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
in our measurements

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,680
followed by the results

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
since here in this study we are curious

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,519
about digital filtering

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,440
in our measurements we consider both

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,640
mobile applications

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,400
and websites and before i conclude this

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,120
talk

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
i will show based on measurements how

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
digital filtering reflects the wider

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,959
geopolitical events

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,680
so as i have mentioned before we can say

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,000
that

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,159
it is universally known that saudi

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
arabia is often considered to be a

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
conservative country

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,720
and for that the saudi government is

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
committed to predict the values and the

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,280
islamic beliefs of the saudi society

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
in addition to providing national

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
security and public safety

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
with that being said it makes the

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,879
internet service available

98
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,040
but manages this access with a filtering

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
system to restrict

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
access to contents that are deemed to be

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,640
unacceptable or inappropriate

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
so basically the blocking is applied to

103
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
any web content

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
that violates the islamic values shares

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
contents that saudi arabia considers

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,480
immoral

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,360
such as pedophilia drugs pornography and

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,239
gambling

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
or harms national security

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
unlike other countries who ambiguously

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
block whip pages

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,400
saudi arabia makes blocking explicit so

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,239
as we can see here from the figures the

114
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
blue warning page is displayed

115
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
when a user tries to access a web

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
content that violates the regulations of

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
the ministry of culture and information

118
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,919
while the green one is for any other

119
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,120
category

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,080
that is classified to be inappropriate

121
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
such as drugs pornography

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
and gambling

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
in the last years saudi arabia has

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,120
undergone

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
significant sociopolitical changes

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
and as i have said these changes are

127
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,680
combined with significant political

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
events in the region

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
which seem to have brought forward a

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,639
more progressive approach

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,560
regarding access to the information and

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
to the internet in general

133
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
with taking all of these things into

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
consideration in our study we focus on

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,039
answering

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,800
three main questions what content

137
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,440
is filtered how is filtering implemented

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
and how does filtering evolve over time

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
in response to geopolitical

140
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,159
conditions

141
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
so to answer these questions we have

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,880
conducted a comprehensive

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,160
longitudinal study from march 2018

144
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
to april this year by performing

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,639
three measurements taken one year apart

146
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,120
and to be more specific in our study we

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
pursue three strategies

148
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
to answer the first question we use a

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
strategy which we refer to

150
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
as quantification

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,199
in here we conducted measurements to

152
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,000
test

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
the network accessibility of set of

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
sites

155
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,120
we found that the most blocked category

156
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
is adult

157
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,479
and we also found evidence that the

158
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,520
filtering

159
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,319
has been decreased by 3.4 percent

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,080
showing that there is a progress

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
towards opening the digital borders in

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
saudi arabia

163
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,039
following the same strategy we also

164
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,120
conducted a systematic study

165
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
to check the accessibility of 18 mobile

166
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,199
applications

167
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,840
including whatsapp skype facetime and

168
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,400
many others

169
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,199
we found that our mobile apps group was

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,240
completely blocked

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
in 2017 and all apps are turned to be

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,000
accessible in 2020 except wechat

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,199
next to answer the second question we

174
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,000
try to

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,520
understand the filtering implementation

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
our results show that the filtering is

177
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,360
based on

178
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,479
http and tls filtering and we believe

179
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,000
that this work is the first

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,440
to identify this type of filtering

181
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,400
lastly to answer the third question we

182
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
interpreted the results

183
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
to see if there is any connection with

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
the geopolitical events

185
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
and interestingly we found that

186
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
isis-friendly sites are blocked

187
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,680
since isis is considered to be a radical

188
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,960
group and supports terrorism

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
we also found that some qatari iranian

190
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
and turkish sites

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
are blocked due to political tensions

192
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
with these countries

193
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,360
to identify the scope of internet

194
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
filtering inside saudi arabia

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
we tested the reachability of the most

196
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
popular websites

197
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,599
in 18 different categories based on

198
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
alexa ranking which is a service

199
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,479
provided by amazon

200
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,639
for our measurements we developed a new

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
tool that was inspired by significantly

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,319
expanding

203
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,720
an earlier tool named samisdat

204
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,960
and specifically in our tool we take a

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,479
site as an input

206
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,960
then perform a set of tests to determine

207
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
the blocking level

208
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,199
so the output of this tool is going to

209
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,840
be

210
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000
the classification of the filtering

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
whether it's based on dns

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,039
ib http and rtls

213
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,840
we evaluated internet filtering from

214
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,199
four vantage points

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
inside saudi arabia which are riyadh

216
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,520
which is the capital city of saudi

217
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,319
arabia

218
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,120
judda makkah which is the most important

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
holy city in islam

220
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,440
and al-khobar

221
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
as shown here in the table we found that

222
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,720
sites are

223
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,519
filtered based on http and tls filtering

224
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,839
the most blocked category is adults

225
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,640
which contain

226
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,120
sites related to drug gambling and

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,839
pornography

228
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
unlike previous work we also conducted

229
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
systematic measurements on mobile

230
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,240
applications

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,839
to test their accessibility inside saudi

232
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,160
arabia

233
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,640
our study involved a total of 18 mobile

234
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,680
apps including

235
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,800
whatsapp facetime skype line

236
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,479
telegram and many others

237
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
prior to our study we found that all

238
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
voice over

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
ip protocol call services were blocked

240
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
by the communications and information

241
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
technology commission

242
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
citc however

243
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
back in 2017 citcc

244
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
announced an official statement to lift

245
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
the ban on all applications

246
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
that meet the regularity requirements of

247
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,760
the country

248
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
over the three-year period of our study

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
we evaluated the connectivity of the

250
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,720
apps

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
by installing them on two iphones one in

252
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
saudi arabia and the other in

253
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
the united states

254
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
in our study we were interested in chart

255
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
services which are text

256
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,360
audio and video calls

257
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
here we show the results for the app's

258
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,800
measurements

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,839
so based on our measurement study on the

260
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,200
18 messaging apps

261
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
we found that audio and video calls were

262
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,240
heavily blocked from 2013 to 2017.

263
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,279
however in 2018 we see that the

264
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
filtering has been lifted

265
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,519
on all applications except for viper

266
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
whatsapp telegram and amo

267
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,720
as we move to 2019 almost all

268
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
applications were open

269
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
except for the audio and video calls in

270
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
whatsapp and wechat

271
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
however this year specifically on april

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,120
we conducted the same study and found

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,600
that

274
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
the ban on whatsapp has been lifted and

275
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,320
that the only blocked app is

276
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
is still wechat interestingly

277
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,640
we have exhibited a uniquely different

278
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
behavior when testing wechat

279
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
which is the most popular mobile

280
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,160
application

281
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
in china we couldn't even install the

282
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
app since the installation required us

283
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
to pass a security check

284
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
which insisted that we should have a

285
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
wechat friend to help us

286
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
in the registration unsurprisingly

287
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
this security check insisted that this

288
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
sweetheart friend

289
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
herself must meet certain requirements

290
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,480
as shown here in the figure

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
over the past years the middle east

292
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
experienced several major political

293
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,279
events

294
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,680
that affected societies internally and

295
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,519
externally

296
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
consequently these events affected saudi

297
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,279
arabian policies

298
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,240
regarding access to information and to

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,560
the internet

300
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,320
in our study we were interested in

301
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,079
finding these connections

302
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,640
between geopolitical events and digital

303
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
filtering

304
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,880
based on our measurements a prominent

305
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,680
event

306
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,839
is the rise of the so-called the islamic

307
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,120
state in iraq

308
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
and syria known as isis

309
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,560
without the reasonability of a number of

310
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,720
isis websites

311
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
that we don't disclose for ethical

312
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,399
reasons and we found that

313
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,639
isis-friendly sites are blocked since

314
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,480
saudi arabia considers them

315
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,320
to advocate terrorism and

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,600
destabilization to the region

317
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,079
also during our study we found that some

318
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,720
qatari

319
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,279
iranian and turkish news sites were

320
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,079
blocked

321
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
due to the increased diplomatic tensions

322
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,560
with these countries in the recent

323
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,199
past years

324
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
so in this talk i presented our

325
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
lunchtime study

326
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,399
of digital filtering in saudi arabia

327
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,800
the results show that saudi arabia has

328
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,639
made progress towards opening its

329
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,639
digital borders

330
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,000
the tool we developed for our

331
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
measurements is an open source and

332
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,079
please don't hesitate to contact me by

333
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,160
email to request it for now

334
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,680
eventually we will have it downloadable

335
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,160
in addition the three-year span of our

336
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,880
study

337
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
enables us to observe changes in the

338
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,160
filtering policy

339
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
and view these changes in the wider

340
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
geopolitical context

341
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
experienced by the kingdom and the

342
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
region

343
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,000
for future work in the short term we are

344
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,839
considering studying server-side

345
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
filtering

346
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:21,600
i hope you enjoyed the talk thank you

347
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
you
