1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,760
hey everyone

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,519
my name is arya nyaki and today i'm

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,200
going to be presenting our work triplet

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,920
sensors

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,679
demystifying great firewalls dns

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,119
censorship behavior

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,880
this is a joint work with anonymous and

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,240
researchers at the university of

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
massachusetts amherst at stony brook

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
university

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
we know that the great firewall of china

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,439
is one of the more advanced internet

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,199
censorship mechanisms so we have the

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,640
following questions about how it

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,920
leverages dns

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,559
to do internet censorship specifically

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,760
what domains are blocked

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
what are the ips used in the forced dns

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,120
responses

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,559
how are the domains being blocked and

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,719
finally is a blocking consistent within

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,520
china

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
to answer these questions we designed

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
the following methodology

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,680
to find the domains that are censored or

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,440
poisoned by the great firewall

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
we send dns queries from a machine in

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,760
the u.s to a chinese vps under our

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,600
control which doesn't have any dns

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
resolving or forwarding functionality

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
so any replies you receive are going to

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,400
be from the great firewall itself

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
this way we can infer which websites are

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
in the blackness of the great firewall

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,000
we use this method to test the websites

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
on the alexa top million list every two

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
hours across nine months

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,040
and in total we sent 2.8 billion dns

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,520
queries and observed around 120 million

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,080
forged responses

41
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,840
our first question is about what domains

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
are blocked by the great firewall

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
in the beginning of our measurement we

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,159
observed that around 24 000 websites

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,439
from the alexa list

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,200
are censored by the great firewall using

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,799
dns injection

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,960
as shown in the figure this number

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,720
increases to 24

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
600 at the end of our measurement when

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
analyzing the number of censored

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
websites added and dropped on a daily

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,079
basis

54
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
we found one major drop on november 18th

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,960
and after further investigating this we

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
found that this drop is currently due

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
to a keyword rule change from

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,560
youtube.com to dot youtube.com

59
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,079
the last thing we want to cover on

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
characterizing the domains is which

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
categories of websites are mostly

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,880
censored

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,639
the top 10 categories with the highest

64
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
percentage of domain censored

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,400
are shown in this table we see that 46

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,160
of the domains in the proxy avoidance

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
category are censored by the great

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
firewall

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
and the next top category is personal

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,319
websites

71
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,319
the reason behind this is that there are

72
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,560
a lot of blogspot domains and the alexa

73
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,599
top million list

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
in the personal websites category and

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
apparently the great firewall has a cure

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
keyword rule for blogspot.com

77
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,640
we next discuss what ips are used in

78
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,680
these forged dns responses

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
we know that the great firewall injects

80
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
dns packets in response to sensitive

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,720
queries

82
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,120
we analyze these injected ip addresses

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
and specifically

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,519
wanted to answer the following two

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,239
questions how do these ips change

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,280
and where do these ips belong to this

87
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,720
figure shows the top five

88
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
top five asses that have the most number

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
of injected ips belonging to them

90
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
in the first two months we observed

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,239
around 1500 ips belonging to 41 ass

92
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
being used by the great firewall but

93
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
interestingly we saw a decrease in the

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
number of distinct ips injected

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,440
by the great firewall on november 23rd

96
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,000
after this

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,599
day the great firewall only uses 216 ips

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,400
belonging to

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
21as since the great firewall is using

100
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,840
publicly

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
rotable ip addresses we set up an

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
experiment to test the reachability of

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,319
these ip addresses over a week

104
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,000
it's important whether these ips are

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
reachable from china because

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
the clients will try to establish

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
connections to these ip addresses after

108
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
they receive the dns response

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
so for each ip address we tried to

110
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
establish tcp handshakes

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
on ports 80 and 443 from both u.s and

112
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
china

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
as specified in the figure there are

114
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
around 20 percent of the ipv4 pairs

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,519
that receive a response to our packets

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,200
when tested from the us

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
but not when tested from china this

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,599
confirms that the great firewall also

119
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,239
performs

120
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
some degree of ip blockings

121
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,760
finally we observed an interesting

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
finding about the relation between the

123
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,879
sensor domains

124
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,439
and the injected ips they receive we

125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
noticed that when aggregating our data

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,440
on a daily or weekly basis

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
there were some domains that always

128
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
received the same set of ip addresses

129
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,720
for example when sending queries for

130
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,040
hideip.co

131
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
we observe that the injected ips it

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
receives over time

133
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,160
were only three unique ips so with our

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
data set we were able to observe five

135
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,080
distinct ipm domain groups

136
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
and it's important to note that the

137
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
mains in each group always receive the

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
same ips

139
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
when aggregated these groups were

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
consistent across our measurements

141
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
for example we found that the great

142
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,240
firewall uses only three ip addresses

143
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
to censor a set of eight domains and

144
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,320
which mostly belong to the proxy

145
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
avoidance category

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
since this is an overview table group 6

147
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
actually contains the remaining domains

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
that receive from a set of 197 ids

149
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
we now focus on how these domains are

150
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
being blocked by the great firewall

151
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
as shown in the figure we observe an

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
interesting phenomenon that is

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
when sending one sensitive query we

154
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
sometimes get up to three forged

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,919
responses from the great firewall

156
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,680
but why are we getting multiple

157
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
responses

158
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,840
it turns out that there are multiple

159
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
injectors of a great firewall on the

160
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,880
same path

161
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
and we found that each injector

162
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
maintains a different block list so

163
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
queries for different domains can

164
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,280
trigger different number of responses

165
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
for example as shown in the figure only

166
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
queries for 55 domains can trigger

167
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,039
all three injectors we then try to

168
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,880
fingerprint the injectors by using

169
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,919
all fields in the ip udp and dns headers

170
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,680
and as summarized in the table we were

171
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
able to find

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,360
three fingerprints for the injectors

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
injector 1 always sets

174
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
its dns ttl to 60 and turns on the dns

175
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
authoritative answer slack

176
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
while the other two injectors don't set

177
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
that flag you can find more details

178
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
about these fingerprints in our paper

179
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,479
we also notice the relation between the

180
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,880
domain ip groups and the injectors for

181
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,919
example

182
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
group 4 which consists of 33 domains and

183
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,039
the

184
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
search engines category only gets

185
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
censored by injector 1.

186
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
you can also find more detail on this in

187
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,800
our paper

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
when sending queries rapidly towards our

189
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,039
host in china

190
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
we see that interestingly the three

191
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
injectors also behave slightly

192
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
differently in how they format their dns

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,400
responses

194
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
for example similar to what has been

195
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,240
reported in previous work

196
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
we find that the ipid and iptl of

197
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,080
injector 1 are associated

198
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,960
with its injection sequences however

199
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,080
those fields

200
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,919
seem to be completely random for

201
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,680
injector 2.

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
while it appears here that injector 3

203
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
has a fixed ttl value

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
we actually find that it mirrors the ttl

205
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
value of the pro packet

206
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,960
we'll talk more about this in the next

207
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,359
slides

208
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
next we try to locate the injection

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
points of the great firewall

210
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
using traceroute we found that our

211
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,759
machine in china is located 25 hops away

212
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,000
from

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,560
our machine in the u.s we tried to send

214
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,919
dns packets with incremented iptl values

215
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,080
to our control mission in china to see

216
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
at which iptl we actually receive a

217
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
response from the great firewall

218
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
we observed that when setting the iptl

219
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,759
from 1 to 15

220
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
we received no responses but when

221
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
setting the iptl from 16 to 24 meaning

222
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,639
that we don't even reach our machine in

223
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,440
china

224
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
we observe two responses from injector 1

225
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,039
and injector 2 from the great firewall

226
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,080
we continue to increase the iptl and

227
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,599
when the iptl value is between 25 and 28

228
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,840
we still receive two responses from

229
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
injector 1 and 2.

230
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
and strangely when setting the iptl

231
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
larger than 29

232
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,599
we get three responses back from the

233
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,759
three injectors we identify

234
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,440
this is actually weird since the number

235
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,160
of hops between our machine and the us

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,720
in the u.s and china is 25 hops but when

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,800
setting the iptl to 29

238
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,879
which is larger than the number of hops

239
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,080
between

240
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,759
our machine in the u.s and china we get

241
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,440
an extra response

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
we tested this using seven different

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
locations outside of china

244
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,759
and saw the same behavior i'll explain

245
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,360
the reason behind this in the next slide

246
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
after closely analyzing the results of

247
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,399
the ip

248
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,880
incremented iptl experiment and our

249
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,839
fingerprints

250
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,080
we observe that injector 3 has its

251
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,958
behavior of

252
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,120
mirroring the iptl of the packet it

253
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
observes

254
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
so the reason why we didn't observe

255
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,000
three responses when the ttl

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,720
was between 16 and 29 is this behavior

257
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
let's go through an example when we add

258
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
the center set the iptl value to 29 and

259
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
send it towards our host in china

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,680
when the packet reaches the great

261
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,600
firewall who is sitting 15 hops away

262
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,399
from us

263
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,440
the iptl value will be 14. what the

264
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,959
great firewall injector does

265
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,760
is that it creates a dns forge response

266
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,000
with iptl value

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
equal to 14 plus 2 and send this back to

268
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
us

269
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,959
and we receive the response however if

270
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,560
we initially set the iptl value to 16

271
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
when the packet reaches the great

272
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
firewall the iptl value will be one and

273
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
in result

274
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
the dns force packet it will create will

275
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
have iptl3 now this response will never

276
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,480
reach us

277
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,839
it's important to note that this

278
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,760
analysis is based on the assumption that

279
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,640
the rotating path

280
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
is symmetric

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,519
so finally when sending dns queries to

282
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
the ip of the rotor that appears to have

283
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,519
the great firewall injectors

284
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
we found that there is no difference in

285
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
the arrival time of the three forged

286
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,040
responses

287
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
this indicates that these injectors are

288
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
indeed sitting in the same location

289
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
finally we investigate whether our

290
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
observation was limited to our control

291
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
mission in china or consistent within

292
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
all china for this purpose we select

293
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,600
36 000 ip prefixes belonging to china

294
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,720
from keda

295
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,839
and we select a non-responding ip for

296
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,440
each proof fix

297
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
then we issue sensitive queries for a

298
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,680
single domain to all ips from a single

299
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,079
point outside of china

300
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
the results are that we see the three

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,120
injectors

302
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
in most ip prefixes but there are only

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
eight percent of the prefixes

304
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,200
registered to 114 ass where no dns

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,560
injector is triggered

306
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,959
furthermore we see that the three

307
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,839
fingerprints cover most of the ip

308
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,000
prefixes

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
and there are only four percent of the

310
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
prefixes that have an injector whose

311
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
fingerprint is different from the three

312
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,440
we identified

313
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
you can find more details about this in

314
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,120
our paper

315
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
in summary in this work we found that

316
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
the great firewall injects

317
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,200
different set of ips to censor different

318
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
groups of domains

319
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,079
we then fingerprinted the three

320
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,000
injectors of the great firewall

321
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
and found that they all appear to share

322
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,000
the same injection point

323
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
more specifically injectors 1 injector

324
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,839
1's ipid and iptl are associated with

325
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
its injection sequence

326
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,320
however injector 3's iptl equine

327
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,880
behavior

328
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,600
has some implications on using the ttl

329
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,480
limited pro

330
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,839
packets to localize injectors we also

331
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
observed that the dns injections can be

332
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,160
seen in 91 percent of the ipp fixes in

333
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,680
china

334
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
we have released all our code and data

335
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
set on the following website

336
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,839
and thank you for listening to our talk
