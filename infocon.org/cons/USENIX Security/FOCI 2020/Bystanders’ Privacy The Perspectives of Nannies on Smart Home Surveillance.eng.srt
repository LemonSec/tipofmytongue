00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,960
i am julia burned i am presenting

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
research with ruba abu salma and alyssa

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,519
ferc

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
on the perspectives of nannies on smart

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,640
home surveillance

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
as a case study of bystander privacy

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so to the extent that smart home devices

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
are designed for privacy at all

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,439
it's the privacy of the end user who

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,519
chose to install the device

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
but of course iot devices collect data

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,800
on a whole environment

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
including other people in the situation

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,640
and that can include people who may be

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,559
targeted for surveillance by the devices

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,000
such as children

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,360
and it can also include others who

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,719
aren't targeted but are simply

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,200
bystanders such as guests

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,800
taken together we'll call those two

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,920
groups non-primary users

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
it's well established in the literature

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
that new technologies affect

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,640
different people's privacy differently

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,120
depending on socioeconomic factors

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
and there's been a good bit of work on

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
that in the past decades specifically

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
with respect to the internet of things

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,680
and so what can we do about all that our

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,640
long-term goal

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
is to identify ways to empower

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,479
non-primary users to have better control

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
over their data

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
to reach that goal we need data and

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
stories from people who are likely to be

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,439
bystanders to

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,240
or targets of iot data collection and

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,880
we're focusing on smart homes

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,640
our first case study is with domestic

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
child care workers

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,080
and with parents who employ such workers

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
exploring their perspectives and

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
experiences

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
manny's are an interesting case in part

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,119
because they can either be targets of

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,400
intentional surveillance by their

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,119
employers

48
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,040
or they can be bystanders to devices

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,159
that happen to be there for other

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,079
reasons

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
for our research questions first of all

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,640
we want to explore nanny's experiences

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
with being observed and recorded by

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
smart home devices that they didn't

55
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,520
choose to deploy

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,960
and we want to see what their privacy

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
attitudes expectations and concerns are

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,600
about those devices

59
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
next care work in the home brings

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,119
together multiple contexts

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
for the parents it's their home where

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,079
they're used to having more control over

63
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,439
what happens

64
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,119
for the nanny it's their workplace so

65
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
there's financial considerations

66
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,639
but also certain expectations about

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
professional boundaries

68
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,319
on the other hand it's a care context

69
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,680
where they're caring for a vulnerable

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,319
child

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
that can affect the balance between

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,920
safety concerns and privacy rights

73
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,200
so we're interested in how the

74
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
potentially conflicting norms about data

75
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
collection and use for those three

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,360
contexts

77
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
affect each party's expectations and

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
attitudes and choices

79
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
next we're really interested in how

80
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
these type of technologies can interact

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
with power dynamics

82
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
how control of the technology might

83
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
reflect existing dynamics

84
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,080
and how the technology might reinforce

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
or change dynamics

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,599
so in any smart home situation there's

87
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,200
going to be asymmetries of knowledge and

88
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,959
control between the person who decides

89
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
to install the device and other people

90
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,040
but here they may align with a whole

91
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
different set of power ray symmetries

92
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,680
related to

93
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
socioeconomic positioning given all that

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
we want to know if there are privacy

95
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,720
related conflicts between nannies and

96
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,280
parents

97
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,640
how are those conflicts negotiated

98
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
and finally we want to look for

99
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
potential points of intervention for

100
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
representing manny's preferences about

101
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,360
data being collected and shared about

102
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,239
them

103
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,840
especially within interactions that

104
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
nannies and employers have about the

105
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,760
devices

106
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,680
this is a two-sided study between

107
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,599
october and december 2019

108
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,200
we interviewed nannies professional

109
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
babysitters and au pairs

110
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
we also interviewed parents who employ

111
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
nannies to get an idea of any potential

112
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
misalignments in their opinions

113
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
attitudes and preferences

114
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,280
to check some of the nanny's assumptions

115
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,879
we designed the interview guides by

116
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,879
reviewing academic literature on smart

117
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,400
homes these are primary perspective

118
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,159
primary user perspectives

119
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,720
um reading content for and from nannies

120
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
and other domestic workers

121
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
such as online forums and blogs and so

122
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
the interview topics included

123
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
experiences with smart home devices

124
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
in homes where nannies work employer

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
employee interactions about devices

126
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
general privacy expectations preferences

127
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,519
and concerns

128
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
and also legal and technical protections

129
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
but the bulk of the interview time was

130
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
usually given to cameras but we also

131
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
covered other devices

132
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,760
we are currently conducting thematic

133
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
analysis of the nanny interviews

134
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
using a code book that the three authors

135
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
developed collaboratively to code

136
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,920
transcripts

137
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,238
and identify common themes we haven't

138
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
started analyzing the parent interviews

139
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
yet so all the preliminary findings i'll

140
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,199
be describing are from the nanny

141
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,680
interviews

142
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,520
to obtain a more diverse set of opinions

143
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
we're also collaborating with colleagues

144
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
in the uk and germany to conduct studies

145
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
there in addition to the us

146
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
but i'll just talk about the us data

147
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
here

148
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
we recruited our participants by posting

149
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,440
and distributing flyers locally in the

150
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
bay area

151
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
posting online for example reddit and

152
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,639
facebook groups

153
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,720
uh using the research crowd searching

154
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
platform prolific

155
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
just for the parents side and via

156
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
referrals to other potential

157
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
participants

158
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
we interviewed 26 domestic child care

159
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
professionals mostly in nanny origami

160
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
plus household manager positions

161
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,320
all of them were female which reflects

162
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,400
the demographics field it's 97

163
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
female according to the bureau of labor

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
statistics

165
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,360
we also interviewed 16 parents who

166
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
employ nannies and have devices in their

167
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
homes that could potentially be used for

168
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
surveillance

169
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,639
a note on the limitations of the study

170
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
the main limitation is that recruitment

171
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
interviews being in english

172
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,160
which means that we may not have

173
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
captured issues particular to

174
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
say recent immigrants who aren't yet

175
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
comfortable enough in the dominant

176
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
language

177
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,840
so now i'll give a view over high-level

178
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,160
findings again note that these findings

179
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
are just preliminary based on initial

180
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
analysis

181
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
so the interview is focused mainly on

182
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
smart home devices that are designed and

183
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,759
marketed primarily for surveillance

184
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,000
usually involving cameras like home

185
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
security systems or internet enabled

186
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
baby monitors

187
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,400
so with regard to the cameras um some

188
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
nannies who had experience with cameras

189
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,520
believe that they themselves

190
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
or at least their interactions with the

191
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
children were the primary targets of the

192
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
data collection

193
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,080
um other nannies had more than

194
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,840
bystanders to cameras that they believed

195
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,240
were deployed for other purposes such as

196
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,160
security from intruders or monitoring

197
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
pets or feeling connected to the

198
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
children while the parents are away at

199
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
work

200
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,080
mostly i'm not going to talk about the

201
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,560
parents interviews but i will say that

202
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
indeed some said they had gotten cameras

203
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,319
specifically to observe their nannies

204
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,600
and some had them for other reasons

205
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
for other types of devices like smart

206
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,199
speakers and smart tvs

207
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,720
nannies generally viewed themselves as

208
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,319
bystanders

209
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,000
so you'll notice the implicit threat

210
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,680
model here is focused on whether the

211
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,120
employers are viewing or listening to

212
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,319
the data and how they use the

213
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,840
information

214
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,280
of course for many of the devices

215
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,800
service providers are also collecting

216
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
and monitoring data

217
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
but that data collection is a secondary

218
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
concern for most of our participants if

219
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
they even thought about it at all

220
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
overall nannies had fewer privacy

221
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
concerns about devices that their

222
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,919
employers weren't likely to use for

223
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,120
surveillance

224
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
employers reviewing the alexa queries is

225
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,120
relatively unlikely to impact nanny's

226
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,840
day-to-day

227
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
job experience or job security so i'm

228
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,680
not going to focus on those devices

229
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,560
today since

230
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,919
we aren't seeing as clear of patterns

231
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
yet until we've done more analysis

232
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
um with respect to the cameras most of

233
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,199
our nanny participants viewed in-home

234
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,800
cameras as relatively common

235
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
even to some degree expected but nearly

236
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,199
all the participants believe that

237
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,800
employers should inform nannies about

238
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,759
cameras

239
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,000
lack of disclosure could be viewed as a

240
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
breach of trust or signaling a lack of

241
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
respect

242
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
the nannies we interviewed had a broad

243
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
range of positive and negative attitudes

244
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
toward the use of cameras

245
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
but those attitudes were generally

246
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
pretty nuanced situationally dependent

247
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,160
for example many nannies expressed more

248
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,759
concern about devices capturing

249
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,360
information about their private lives or

250
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,400
behaviors

251
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
like changing clothes or talking on the

252
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
phone with friends

253
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
than to their professional child care

254
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
activities

255
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,039
some participants mentioned potential

256
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
benefits of cameras at least when we

257
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,199
asked whether cameras have benefits

258
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,800
such as protection against wrongful

259
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
accusations physical safety

260
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,639
facilitating communication with their

261
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
employers about child care and so forth

262
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
the purpose of the camera tends to be a

263
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
major factor in nanny's views

264
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
at a high level it could depend on

265
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
whether they believed that the primary

266
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
purpose of having the camera

267
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
was to monitor the nanny or whether it

268
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,160
was primarily for other purposes like

269
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
home security or feeling connected with

270
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
the kids

271
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
um but there's a lot of variation um

272
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
even for cameras that are there to check

273
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
on the nanny so for example

274
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,160
a number of participants drew

275
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
distinctions between

276
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,919
occasional spot checks for parental

277
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,440
peace of mind to make sure that the

278
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
nannies weren't abusing their charges

279
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,919
versus parents constantly watching and

280
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,519
critiquing small details of how the

281
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,399
nannies did their jobs

282
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
transparency about purposes of concern

283
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,680
for some nannies

284
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
especially in some cases where they

285
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,959
suspected that cameras that were

286
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
supposedly installed for home security

287
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,839
might actually

288
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,600
be being used to monitor and spy on them

289
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,000
participants often framed their concerns

290
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
about the purposes of cameras in terms

291
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
of the dynamics of their relationships

292
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
with their employers

293
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
so for example constantly checking

294
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,399
cameras and using the data to

295
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,519
micromanage care

296
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,360
could be seen as a sign of mistrust or

297
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
disrespect on the parent's part

298
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,920
but then on the other hand some

299
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
participants made assumptions about

300
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
purposes of cameras

301
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
and whether their employers had

302
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
basically good intentions about using

303
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,240
them

304
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,680
based on whether they otherwise had a

305
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
good relationship

306
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
although many nannies expressed privacy

307
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
concerns and feelings of discomfort

308
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
about surveillance

309
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
many said that they deferred to parents

310
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
decisions not only about installing

311
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,480
smart

312
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
smart home devices but about their

313
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
choices about where to put them

314
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
about data collection and processing

315
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
configuration of settings

316
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
the power dynamic was expressed in a few

317
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,720
different ways

318
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
that homeowners have a right or they

319
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,839
feel they have a right to choose what

320
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,959
devices to install

321
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,519
and how to use them the parents have a

322
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,959
right to protect their children's safety

323
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,320
or keep tabs on the children when

324
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
they're not at home

325
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
and that employers are free to set the

326
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
rules and conditions of employment

327
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,279
and employees might not be in a position

328
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
to negotiate about it for example due to

329
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,720
job security concerns

330
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
so once we've completed our analysis of

331
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
the interview data we plan to compare

332
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
the us data

333
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,440
with the data from the parallel uk and

334
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
germany studies

335
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
conduct surveys in multiple countries in

336
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
multiple languages

337
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
with both nannies and parents who employ

338
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,880
nannies to quantify the prevalence of

339
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,079
the themes we're observing in the

340
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,120
qualitative studies

341
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
and test the relationships between them

342
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
part as part of the broader research

343
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
program we hope to conduct additional

344
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,600
case studies with other groups of smart

345
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,959
home bystanders

346
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
um including caregivers for older adults

347
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,959
house cleaners or in-home maintenance

348
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,160
workers

349
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,839
groups organizations that hold in-home

350
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
meetings and residents of pre-equipped

351
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
smart housing

352
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
finally we hope to conduct research with

353
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,000
designers developers

354
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
and manufacturers of smart home devices

355
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
to understand their mental models and

356
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,519
expectations about

357
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,880
the non-primary users of the devices

358
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
if they consider non-primary users at

359
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
all

360
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
and then based on all those findings we

361
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,279
plan to develop conversation guides to

362
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,959
facilitate discussion of privacy and

363
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,279
data use between smart home device

364
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
owners and

365
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
surveillance targets and bystanders

366
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,360
to work with domestic employment

367
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
agencies and professional associations

368
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,560
to develop

369
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
disseminate informational materials and

370
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,000
recommendations for employers and

371
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
employees

372
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,279
develop guidelines and trainings for

373
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,040
smartphone product developers about the

374
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
needs and expectations of non-primary

375
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,000
users

376
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
and develop recommendations for

377
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
policymakers for including

378
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,480
considerations about

379
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
bystanders privacy concerns in consumer

380
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,079
privacy of consumer protection

381
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,079
regulations

382
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,920
so thank you very much if you want to

383
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,440
get in touch or get a copy of the full

384
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
paper once the analysis is complete
