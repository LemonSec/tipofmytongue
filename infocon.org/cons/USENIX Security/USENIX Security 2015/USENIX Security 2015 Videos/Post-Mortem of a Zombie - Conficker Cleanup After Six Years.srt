1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,480
so the main idea of this paper

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,340
what we looked at was what happens to
both infected machines has to the

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,770
command-and-control infrastructure
disrupted so as you well know partners

4
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,430
have been a major issue over the past
few years and there's been a lot of

5
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,760
interest and security community about
reverse engineering stopping them in

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,890
different ways on often the latest works
are presented also in USENIX where there

7
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:57,899
has been some really impressive reverse
engineering basically getting into some

8
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,489
kind of both net and eventually finding
a way to take over command and control

9
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:08,570
server or disrupted etcetera and this is
really great because it's kind of

10
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,419
removes it from the control of the
attackers but what actually happens to

11
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:25,390
deuce song machines so the idea from
this paper came from the data we cut

12
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,410
taxes to from the Conficker Working
Group where they have mean this to be

13
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:45,310
tracking Conficker botnet from the early
days around 2009 and we had we've

14
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,940
received taxes on record well it's
really interesting to look into this

15
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:58,350
question so as you can see on this line
that on this graph

16
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:07,570
this is the number of IP addresses scene
and the Conficker sinkhole per day from

17
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:18,250
February 2009 till now still and 2014
over a million IP addresses could be

18
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:25,090
seen each day and a conflict or single
which is quite a lot and seeming like

19
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:34,630
understanding that this pop it came out
in late 2008 it spread via Microsoft

20
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,459
Windows vulnerability and later versions
also available shares and USB devices so

21
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:47,069
the bucket was pretty good and how it
would propagate and it's also used

22
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:55,619
pretty novel way to communicate with its
basically controllers I'm the one that

23
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,230
grew up really fast pace or already in
the first few months and aliens of

24
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:07,119
machines were infected Internet
community was very worried so they set

25
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,959
up very quickly

26
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,420
working group which in many ways was
dreaming about this and there was a lot

27
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,619
of voluntary worked with a lot of
organizations and they managed to the

28
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,000
malware I also come up with these this
list of domains

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,120
actually take over to the means every
day in this way basically do what newt

30
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,620
was taken out of the control of the
attackers I can see from this graph the

31
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,079
number of infected machines remains
relatively high this is well known to

32
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,060
the working group themselves already

33
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,360
when they release a report in 2010 they
report to their number one failure

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,450
remediation so what can be done during
around the same time from 2010 onwards

35
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:10,170
and mother it's a major discussion and
push more responsibility on cleaning up

36
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,320
machines onto internet service providers
are a number of proposals by different

37
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,149
industry groups and between gate yes
markets a truck on this issue

38
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:28,469
there has been also support a number of
policy think tanks on this issue and the

39
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,979
new number of countries since early 2010
we've had these and he brought the

40
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:41,789
initiatives visit with these initiatives
do is through some kind of centers and

41
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:48,270
here's an example they monitor various
internet feeds for the presence of

42
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:57,039
infected machines where they find an
infected machine into the icy denote I B

43
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:03,060
notify the customer the customer is then
send to a website here you see the

44
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:12,020
website for the German antibody advisory
center and basically will get help in

45
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,150
cleaning up their machine etc so the
question we were interested in

46
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,450
were weird these countries with these
national anthem about that centers doing

47
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:32,490
a better job in cleaning up thoughts or
not so the question itself is relatively

48
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,449
easy question the point was we wanted to
answer well in

49
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:49,099
valid and reliable way idea is to use
data from congress and cold which logs

50
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:57,058
every machine infected with Conficker
trying to connect to the these demands

51
00:05:57,059 --> 00:06:02,199
to get commands and it locks the IP
addresses of these machines on these

52
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:09,249
machines connect multiple times a day so
these logs are under huge by doing

53
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:15,930
historical GeoIP and is something up on
these loans can actually see where he's

54
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:24,509
infected machines were then I can get
these two countries levels we can then

55
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,469
compare countries with these empty
bucket initiatives versus those without

56
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:34,240
so that's the idea in a nutshell but
there are still a bunch of measurement

57
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,930
issues the old one of the most famous
one perhaps is the problems caused by

58
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,939
dynamic IP addresses Internet service
providers in some countries have called

59
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:54,719
this is where data signed a new IP
address to customer perhaps on Saturday

60
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,529
or might be multiple times a day and
what that means is that the same

61
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:04,659
infected machine which

62
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,930
different IP addresses and we will have
some kind of our accounting these grants

63
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:17,180
saudis so on the top is great for that
never goes beyond his reach Germany and

64
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:26,350
on the left side we have the number of
unique IP addresses we see in the

65
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,880
sinkhole in that particular country per
day

66
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:38,110
i dont the right we show the same number
of IP addresses but I cumulated per hour

67
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,730
for the course of the week and as you
can see all the number of infected

68
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:51,510
machines are more or less stable this
second number really can grow high we

69
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,980
decided to correct for it was to use the
shortest time window possible we use our

70
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,090
early this will under talent a bit but
that is fine because we want to actually

71
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:10,919
compare numbers so under town centre
lead and its other kinds of issues

72
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:18,210
include missing measure runs you to sink
hole down times way to solve that is we

73
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,969
filter about 10 percent of the points
there with regards to the effects of

74
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,590
that on these kind of measure mins major
problems are caused by carrier-grade not

75
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,718
so we do take to tease for a number of
countries like India remove them from

76
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:43,160
the dataset and another issue is well
countries have different sizes so

77
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,650
obviously the number of infected
machines with Conficker and aus is going

78
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,569
to be much higher than the Netherlands
and that in itself is not

79
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,550
interesting point of comparison what is
actually interesting would be kind of

80
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:05,020
infection rate so for this reason we
divide the counts by the number of

81
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:15,540
subscribers in countries now this is
what we have as you can see in this

82
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,189
truck

83
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:26,990
basically plotted for Germany France USA
Russia trends you can see that the

84
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,950
country's move with similar trends or as
a growth plan to indicate their

85
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,940
systematic differences of the peak
levels and it's rather interesting what

86
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,710
we see here we actually went to news
media etc and you can't directly

87
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:50,750
pinpoint what's causing these down
slopes at set we thought of modeling is

88
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,620
using various ways we looked at the
epidemic model Armada regressive moving

89
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:04,130
average models hazard models etc in the
end we actually opted for a rather

90
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:10,510
simple model that uses

91
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:18,390
basically two seasons the first base is
the largest growth and the second is the

92
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:26,319
exponential decay this model captures
the curves or transferred different

93
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,450
countries in a number of parameters that
represent what can be observed in the

94
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:41,240
DataDirect I just took questions from
our viewers white model explains I'm

95
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,410
doing with those models have assumptions
of for instance what is rates infections

96
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,150
per cycle or cleanups recycle etc and or
as some of the more advanced models

97
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:01,319
include a number of latent variables
which we cannot saudis would add extra

98
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,330
complications on it would be further
from our goal which was to come heritage

99
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:17,780
countries so these are the results 46
countries they lose Germany USA Ireland

100
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:24,500
France and South Korea these plots the
blue lines are single day to learn to

101
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,830
read our values based on d'amato as you
can see the numbers for instance are

102
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:42,140
here for Germany to growth rate is your
point one and the decay rate 2001 and

103
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,920
just our stories $20.99

104
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:57,060
the paper contains the results for sixty
countries that we used in the study

105
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,219
dislike what we have is the conflict
growth rate for the various countries

106
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:12,640
each point is one of the sixty countries
and to study the great lines are

107
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:23,000
basically errors with regards to the
optimization techniques used the red

108
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:34,570
points or red cross the countries with
the ante by blood centers and countries

109
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:46,010
with garden centers they do a bit better
I'm a few of them actually Australia

110
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:53,220
career they're doing a bit worse the
media in terms of the growth rate of

111
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,080
America so basically they are all over
the place and we can do the same

112
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:08,750
producer partners basically at the peak
what percentage of

113
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,650
machines or Internet subscribers were
infected with Conficker and here you can

114
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:21,720
see the most of the countries with the
idea about them centers actually did

115
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:33,410
that the media with for instance finding
the Netherlands doing very well but that

116
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,329
does not tell anything directly about
the effects of these and development

117
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:45,380
centers because no way or Denmark
withheld EastEnders they also did really

118
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:56,920
well finally the period so basically how
to clean up went and here again

119
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,260
countries with young development centers
are all over the place perhaps strange

120
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:12,900
the few of these countries did worse
than the media meaning that teamed up

121
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:21,140
with even slower in these countries and
so basically we observed no evidence of

122
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,420
countries with mass or anti botnet
initiatives doing a better job at

123
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,329
cleaning up Conficker we thought perhaps
the bots are actually located outside

124
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,400
retailer is these

125
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,260
that's why these initiatives don't have
an effect on them what you see in this

126
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,590
table is we looked at what percentage of
computer parts were in the diocese in

127
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:57,940
the different countries and as you can
see the averages of 75% so that couldn't

128
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,230
explain that the other thing was perhaps
ok computers are still not that it has

129
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:09,060
no priorities so these important
initiatives they ignore Conficker what

130
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:19,520
looked out was the overlap between
another botnet which we have for

131
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,829
specific period last year game over
confident we found that if you look at

132
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:32,350
the IP addresses daily there was a 6%
over 96 percent of the thoughts that

133
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:38,770
appeared in the game resumed they also
had company which is surprisingly high

134
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,780
number because we also only compared it
with wondered about that kind of makes

135
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,870
sense because these machines how bad
hygiene in some ways it should be a

136
00:15:49,870 --> 00:16:00,680
priority so what else can explain he
speaks these differences what percentage

137
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,900
of computers in different countries

138
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,650
experience of this stuff because these
were basically the versions of Windows

139
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,640
that would be affected by Conficker

140
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:18,600
as you can see there is actually a
relationship and this growth on the

141
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,660
x-axis we have a number of boats forces
further on underway access we have a

142
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,680
market share of Windows XP in with but
the relationship so there is some kind

143
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,810
of relationship here but actually if you
run the relation to defy so it doesn't

144
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,380
explain everything there is a big
variants I came up with a new mystery

145
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:51,060
which is infections per vulnerable user
tested against two factors one of them

146
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:58,000
was unlicensed software it's so or also
known as piracy rate is bigger likely to

147
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,619
buy the business software Alliance and
here perhaps unsurprisingly we see again

148
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:12,139
strong correlation and this kind of
tells us the important role automatic

149
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,689
updates plea in keeping machines can
because

150
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,850
often people with pirated versions of
Windows my turn off all to myself this

151
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:31,480
metric we checked against was the ICT
development today this is a figure

152
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,519
that's generated by ITU and it contains
a number of things like Internet

153
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,700
broadband speeds and countries level of
education and said you can think of it

154
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:55,720
to handle the ICT incidents in some ways
I hear interestingly enough countries

155
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:03,639
with higher prices Development Index had
a lower complete copy basically meaning

156
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:11,789
that these countries had the knowledge
companies or people countries are more

157
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:22,970
skills on how to deal with infections or
on how to pasture systems etc how K rate

158
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:32,649
compared with actually change of dollars
or upgrade rid of Windows because if you

159
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:38,018
change your machine or if you upgrade
your windows to induce 718 kind of

160
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:44,220
atlantic gets rid of conflict and what
you see on this crop is each point

161
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:51,049
represents the country's on the x-axis
that decay rate of Windows XP and Vista

162
00:18:51,049 --> 00:19:00,370
and access and all the countries behind
his thoughts below this stuff to try the

163
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,479
decay rate of Conficker is even slower
than the typical rate or machines get

164
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,340
change their upgrade and this is sad in
some ways but it also makes sense

165
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,090
because it tells you something about who
is this group of people who still

166
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,139
remained infected with a virus in this
world after so many years and the same

167
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:33,169
group is probably also the group that
changes their machines

168
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:39,830
so in summary the antibiotic that
initiatives had no observable impact on

169
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,949
the growth he kind of Conficker on the
other hand a number of institutional

170
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,100
factors did

171
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:57,399
regression they can explain about 80% of
the peak so what does this mean one

172
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,580
question again term was perhaps as I
said he came with the does it mean that

173
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,409
I just got a part of these antibiotics
initiative we're not taking conflict

174
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,309
with seriously or perhaps the Centers
for not taking comfort or seriously we

175
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:17,289
presented their results actually a few
months ago to terms with members of a

176
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:27,610
number of different antibody working to
ISPs that what they told us was rather

177
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:34,809
interesting they told us that they were
doing something about Conficker they had

178
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,070
been doing yet and this accident celinda
date because both high speeds rank

179
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:46,720
better with regard to conflict peak than
their peers in their countries but they

180
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,500
said that for instance one of the
challenges were sometimes they have to

181
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,159
notify Customer many many times before
they could take action and sometimes

182
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,980
consumers would just repeat infections
so these are interesting challenges

183
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,980
though that basically we can please call
if we want to recycle improved these

184
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,549
initiatives and make them more effective
in the long run I know another issue

185
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:20,240
they pointed out was because of
licensing issues with minibar injuries

186
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,049
they couldn't often points customer its
towards the simple tool where the

187
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:34,168
customer just click and that would clean
up their machine this brings us to last

188
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,620
light which is

189
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,739
bit more thinking about the policy
implications of the findings we just

190
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,850
described so they can be managed that is
good news

191
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:55,209
the correlation with ICT development
tells us that but the cleanup goes hand

192
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:04,050
in hand with also capacity building so
programs targets developing ICT skills

193
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:11,590
at large are also helpful for what is
clean up being a sense and in a broader

194
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:18,178
picture correlation with software piracy
also tells us not automatically maps are

195
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:24,929
strongest too so perhaps an idea would
be for instance to give I speeds simple

196
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:30,820
tools they can distribute to customers
are easily that will basically reenable

197
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,928
tonight a couple dates for this group of
customers that have had their automatic

198
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:49,470
updates disabled by malware like I think
interesting issue is when such reports

199
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:58,380
these kind of data sets this indicates
ISPs should be taking action against all

200
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,190
these parts are in countries with these
aren't important initiative can actually

201
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:11,350
be used as some kind of metric or for
compliance weather actually all our

202
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:18,959
customers or dishes are maybe they are
with inclusions are not working so it

203
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,820
could be a way also to run experiments
for tweeting etc so in that sense it's

204
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:36,220
interesting that we have these long
before last but not least is I think we

205
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,610
need to also have the mindset of a
marathon runner when we deal with these

206
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:50,039
bottom section so the next what that's
going to be sinkhole already at the

207
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:55,530
start it's good to start you know
perhaps appropriating funds to be able

208
00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:02,049
to run these calls for relatively long
run and basically to have the patience

209
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:07,340
to deal with these in the long run and
we should just accept that as the

210
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:14,840
reality of how this works thank you very
much for your attention I'm sorry that I

211
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,809
couldn't be here to deliver it in person
and equality was not perhaps as good as

212
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:23,889
it could mean

213
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:39,210
some questions

214
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:48,770
can you use them

215
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:57,810
checker for Microsoft Research I could
quit talking the talk and whether these

216
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:06,110
ante by initiative predated or where
post configure and is this is this

217
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,219
something that it's possible they exist
because these countries have such a hard

218
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,380
time dealing with botnets so could there
be something causal here we're in the

219
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,760
same way as we don't really have good
Polio Eradication Initiative in the you

220
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,170
s right now because we don't see pulley
overseeing malaria that it's the

221
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,220
countries that have the biggest problem
getting rid of these things that are

222
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:45,440
most likely to create initiatives thanks
thank you basically it was unclear from

223
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,220
a few of these countries

224
00:25:49,220 --> 00:26:01,080
program as early as 2006 so countries
like Japan Australia Japan started in

225
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,639
2007

226
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,700
it's an interesting question to look at
actually which countries chose to start

227
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:16,110
these programs on it seems there in some
ways the country's take some forms of

228
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,740
social responsibility by the private
sector and public sector come together

229
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,770
and take on social responsibility in
some senses so there might be other

230
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,230
countries that will be added to this in
the future because there are now more

231
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:39,890
countries running these centers so the
EU has a CDC initiative that is

232
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,340
basically adding many more countries to
do list of countries with certain

233
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:51,340
centers but the countries we checked in
in this study all of them had the

234
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,939
center's running before contractor

235
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:07,480
think we have time for about one more
questions

236
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,480
from Rutgers University I'm wondering if
you looked at how the internet service

237
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,800
providers actually notified the infected
machines because there's tons of

238
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,340
research on the way

239
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,449
warnings and notifications can actually
influence the way people respond to it

240
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,800
so I'm just curious what they felt about
it

241
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,000
thank you thank you very much

242
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,890
great question we didn't specifically
look at that for to study here we're

243
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:48,050
kind of treating them as all equal in a
way it's this first country in countries

244
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:53,649
like Japan they actually even send by
post to people when an infection is

245
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:59,040
noticed because they found out that
people react to old-fashioned mail more

246
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,470
than they would react to email and in
countries like the Netherlands and

247
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:13,360
Germany to users internets would get cut
off by some of these ISPs under user

248
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:21,139
will be sent to some kind of quarantine
website so that's also guarantee to grab

249
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,430
the user's attention but you're
absolutely right that differs

250
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:30,960
ISP and it's one of the things we
actually are also very interested in how

251
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,410
proposed as area for future research
where they're actually looking into how

252
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:41,900
you can tweak these notifications will
have a response as one of the people in

253
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,170
these ISPs were telling me they said
they were even interested in france is

254
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:50,090
changing the color will make users react
more or less that senator so definitely

255
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,470
that's will play a role in future
research in this area
