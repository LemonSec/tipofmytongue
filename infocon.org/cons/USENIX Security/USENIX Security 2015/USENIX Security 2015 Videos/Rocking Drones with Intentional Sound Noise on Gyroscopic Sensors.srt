1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,870
hi everyone i am new marks on

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:23,890
this is a joint work with which are
seeing someone came and young soap opera

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,180
Turandot

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:34,090
chair and Professor and professor today
I'm going to talk about

5
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:41,550
especially taking drugs are widely used
for to leave early

6
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,519
search-and-rescue directory and private
having another interesting application

7
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:59,329
is the air terrorism using a weaponized
a few weeks ago on firing drawn was a

8
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:06,310
big issue in the us- I think it's
because he's drawn cannot take someone I

9
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:16,260
used also recently unauthorized drawn
approaches approach it was important

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:25,110
places or people very closely this
happens show their summer tech using

11
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,539
drones are possible and they are not
easy to detect or defense so these days

12
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:40,010
many governments are interested in
shutting down these terms until now

13
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:47,950
several attacks have been proposed the
first tony is physical such as should

14
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:55,990
check on capturing the net and
destroying them using high-powered laser

15
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:05,750
or pump and timing in smoking can cause
denial of service or taking taking

16
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:12,459
control of drones through the wireless
communication channel and software is

17
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:20,290
also possible because cronies are also
kind of embedded system and some rooms

18
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,510
are equipped with GPS receiver to know
their location

19
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,459
these drugs can be guided to the
attackers place or some other places by

20
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:40,940
GPs were speaking how about sensors
sensors are very important for operation

21
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:50,430
however things have not been
investigated yet as Unitech director so

22
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:58,069
we asked this question how secure is
drawn against intentional interference

23
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:06,578
on since this container this is a basic
block diagram of through system the most

24
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:17,709
important part is my concern this is the
brain of drone or user to estimate the

25
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,049
control signal to the flight controller
and then the flight controller decides

26
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:33,609
the speed of Reuters however it is
impossible for women to control drones

27
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:40,599
responding to every variation of
environment so to maintain the balance

28
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,660
of drawn national measurement unit is
required

29
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,430
measurement unit is all you need is a
set of sensor and it is

30
00:03:51,430 --> 00:04:00,310
of strong so using two input from user
and sensor the flight controller can

31
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,880
decide the control signal for all voters

32
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,460
national measurement unit is a set of
sensor which measures orientation or

33
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:24,010
rotation of Thrones body dimensions are
ministers Corp MEMS means a very small

34
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:31,750
machine or mechanical structure because
of MEMS technology challenged course our

35
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:40,270
integrity into a small chip so today
more and more popular this is a

36
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,900
conceptual structure of ministers go
there isn't anything met in the middle

37
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,900
of structure this message continuously
vibrating along to x axis when notation

38
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,969
occurs along to Chi axes of course also
covers in y direction we can measure

39
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,520
this forest and the amount of this force
means the amount of attention because of

40
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,719
this 518 mechanical structure then we
can collisions is considered as an

41
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,440
important factor for themselves

42
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,320
here is a short video about
international

43
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,650
in this video

44
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:41,719
collections can play a class using a
specific frequency ultrasound so high

45
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,530
power sound noise can cause the
Nationals in MEMS gyroscopes this

46
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,989
mechanical engineers to graze the
accuracy of ministers hope this effect

47
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:03,340
is already known in mental search
communities so to reduce this effect it

48
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:12,090
is recommended that transcripts should
have the legend frequencies higher than

49
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,840
20 different in other words higher than
other person during the problem is that

50
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:28,400
people have considered this legends
effect just as I just as performance

51
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,948
degradation however we thought you can
use this effect for taking turns this is

52
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:44,380
our test back to investigate the
gyroscopes output understand annoys the

53
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:51,340
Blue Bus is targeted to investigate and
the red boxes are for generating sound

54
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,919
noise we used a consumer-grade speaker
to generate single tone sound or noise

55
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:05,960
the distance between us and the
gyroscopes was 10 centimetre the sound

56
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,669
just and service is connected to the
audio amplifier to increase the power of

57
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:19,750
sound and then connected to the external
sound card to generate both sound and

58
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:30,700
green boxes are for measurement to to
read data from China

59
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:38,940
using these tests where we will scan the
frequency of 230 yards with a hundred

60
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:47,440
her job interview or experiments are
conducted in a room that has those sound

61
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,890
reflection this room is current anechoic
chamber this is a picture of our contest

62
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:02,599
in anechoic chamber the sound source in
the gyroscopes are fixed to separated

63
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,880
friends the sound pressure level
regenerated was around in nineteen

64
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:20,920
ninety days is considered as the Sun the
level of his victory or heavy truck we

65
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:27,460
tested fifteen different kind of
Ministers specially two of them are you

66
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,260
keep on our target drones are you
explain about them later

67
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,049
among 15 kind of MEMS gyroscopes we've
found the legend of frequencies from

68
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:47,459
seven of them the first three gyroscopes
are manufactured by St micro and their

69
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:55,790
frequencies are not open in public but
my hours can be found there legend

70
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:02,569
frequencies in other words and arranged
for all access order for transcripts are

71
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,210
manufactured by inventions and their
frequencies are described in in their

72
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:18,070
day but except the last one we found
their resonant frequencies only for

73
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,700
texts it is because we could not
generate efficiently designed the

74
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:31,490
frequency about 30 kilometres so this
leisure does not mean they don't have

75
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,930
the legend of frequencies for X&Y axes
for the last one we found each letter to

76
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,620
frequencies for former axis

77
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:49,110
and later on the frequencies of these
four gyroscopes and exist in this means

78
00:09:49,110 --> 00:10:00,170
we cannot hear the sound to show the
amount of noise effect we measured the

79
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,939
standard deviation

80
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:09,160
these figures are standard deviation of
the take the output from where

81
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:20,709
identical gyroscopes you can see that
the output of charter schools have high

82
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:32,680
standards division near year olds in
excesses and Y axis Jackson thrust

83
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,660
referees output from one gyroscopes
trend with eight-year-olds of Sundanese

84
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:48,079
in time domain without knowing the
output of times pope is like the red

85
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:59,360
line but I sound output of gyroscopes
highly flux it so this output has not

86
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:08,000
only high amplitude but also fast
changes so our next question was what is

87
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,300
the impact of this number I'll put to
the expiration of the current system to

88
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:22,819
answer this question we analyzed to open
source premier programs in those in

89
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:29,010
these programs we found the rotor
control over them as I mentioned before

90
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,980
the flight controller has to import the
transmitter data from user and the

91
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,950
gyroscopes data from sensor and one
output the rotor control it

92
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:50,410
this pseudo code describes the rotor
control briefly the first thing you

93
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:57,079
found in this code is that before
expiration the rotor control value is

94
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:05,220
bounded between redefined the meaning
Mesfin effects that continues to root

95
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,400
the gyroscopes output of facts to the
local control directly and there is no

96
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:21,439
filtering water education for sensor
output the last thing is that the rotor

97
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,530
control value can be abnormally
increased when the current value of

98
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:34,860
China's copper output is high with Chris
changes so based on this analysis we

99
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:46,150
tried to attack drones for forest to be
a period to DIY drugs using commercial I

100
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:52,939
am use the first one is equipped with
the gyroscopes made by St micro and its

101
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,770
relation to frequencies is in your truck
during the second one is equipped with a

102
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:09,079
gyroscope made about inventions and its
legend frequencies in which was drawn to

103
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,250
use different for me but the main
controller eyewitness are almost the

104
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:20,700
same for all you want to tack you touch
it

105
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,430
Bluetooth speaker on the target drone to
controlled sound remotely and you also

106
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,920
attention disorder in the wireless
motors to monitor the status of the

107
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:40,709
strong in our demo the sound of noise
you started after after 10 seconds of

108
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,930
normal normal flight and then you'll be
kept for another 10 seconds

109
00:13:45,930 --> 00:14:00,439
here is our time this is normal price
for 10 seconds

110
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:12,670
right after the target on fourth down
and cannot rise during hours after a

111
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:23,689
fair it is controllable again

112
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:33,760
this is the captured data during
previous previous demo the first graph

113
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:41,480
is the output of gyroscopes 43 access
using this data is an improved the

114
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:52,790
flight controller decide the rotor
controlled it the second because our

115
00:14:52,790 --> 00:15:03,880
target on his captors so there are no
terrorists in the region ANC has no

116
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,150
sound noise which means

117
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:14,439
duration of our attack in region B of
the first draft the gyroscopes output is

118
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:22,560
disturbed by our attack due to this
disturbance the rotor control it also

119
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,060
floated almost between meaning extra
news because of this unexpected

120
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:38,099
fractionation the target closed its
control to the last refuge attitude data

121
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,890
from sooner you can see here a sudden
drop in altitude at the beginning of

122
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:58,010
explorer negative but not for trying to
be the main difference is affected

123
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:07,620
excess return is effective for or exists
but target to impede effective we think

124
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:14,680
the region of this failure is that X and
Y axis are more critical for drones

125
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:23,469
stability because you're drawn txs means
horizontal orientation on the other hand

126
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,390
X&Y axis

127
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,819
politicians

128
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:39,760
because we used a smaller consumer grade
speaker is ours and we want to know what

129
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,640
do you happen if we can use more
powerful than answers you know

130
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,449
experiment the minimum some depression
11 attack was about a hundred and eight

131
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:58,080
ten centimeters of distance by the
relationship relationship between sound

132
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,880
pressure level in the distance

133
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:08,160
theoretical in the attack distance can
be increased to thirty seven metre using

134
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:17,079
our service they can generate a hundred
and fourteen that's about one meter for

135
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:28,379
example using this kind of Sun shone in
the slide we think our our attacking be

136
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:37,820
applied to several race it is possible
to attack using another phone with

137
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,020
answers so need weapons in so many words
are also has to be like these pictures

138
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:56,100
we also tried to test long-range attack
and but they were still not easy

139
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:07,370
the regions are here first we tried to
attack using three by three way that he

140
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,559
made

141
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,610
great experiment

142
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:32,379
really hard to aim at the movie in the
area we also borrowed a room range

143
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:39,820
acoustic device that can generate a
hundred and forty days but this device

144
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,559
is optimized for human force so it
cannot generate buzz on the frequency we

145
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:59,230
want all over it is really happy we also
built simpler Sony world using 25 small

146
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:08,650
speakers

147
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:17,050
in this regard the target and just
passed through without any response we

148
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,020
think it's because ours only work is too
thin

149
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,480
actually this only worry is almost
certainly curtain not even when we were

150
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:41,000
so we need we need only were there are
several contributions but we tested for

151
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,950
us improve on physical isolation
isolation is shielding from some so you

152
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:56,640
put forty front of materials between
sound source in the service group is

153
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:05,400
only journal of physical isolation can
reduce the effect of noise to 20% for

154
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:15,810
X&Y axes and the to 60% texts on every
so this means that Casey can be a good

155
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:24,909
defense this kind of attack so in
summary our walks our work is a case

156
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:31,640
study for the threat posed by malicious
since since we found the legend

157
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,610
frequencies from 7 kind of Ministers and
we figured out the fact of Legends in

158
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:46,570
transformer and demonstrated our attack
against room in the more you also

159
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:55,010
suggested several scenarios in the
defense's because most of most of

160
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:02,030
existing defenses did some modification
in how do so now we are in turn

161
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:10,030
interested in developing software best
defense against Shenzhen China I want to

162
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,590
end

163
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:17,740
my my presentation by saying this since
the report should not be fully trusted

164
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,320
because there are always bad guys like
us

165
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:33,220
prison

166
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:47,750
the great work

167
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,650
parts briefly but look like when those
variants it was both up and down on the

168
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,330
plots such as I'm taking moving averages
or something like that towards reducing

169
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,439
the variance even know it would
introduce a lag recently seen the

170
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:09,789
measurement do you mean that the
activity of gyroscopes yes so moving

171
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:13,650
average over the gyroscopic samples in
order to reduce some of the very

172
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,890
experienced

173
00:22:19,890 --> 00:23:12,390
work so the gyroscope is just a blip us
we just know important Alka okay because

174
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:58,350
you know the biracial may have
orientation

175
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:49,199
other response from different
frequencies and because you're drawn the

176
00:24:49,200 --> 00:25:01,890
main sensor is so

177
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:24,590
operators

178
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:37,449
so so we borrow did the shoot from
police and it was like a $20,000 and it

179
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:45,039
was playing the conduit I think 250 GB
and I mean you cannot you cannot do any

180
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,150
kind of experiment instead of kind of
gym and you it's gonna be a killer years

181
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:59,570
so this way the use of those things I
mean frankly speaking I think everything

182
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,100
was the most difficult one for this
paper was actually would experiments

183
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,408
because whenever it breaks me whenever
we are successful it's gonna break the

184
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:16,899
popular and all those things I think all
those like I mean I've been doing some

185
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:22,250
other work but I mean this kind of
mechanical

186
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,380
experience I've ever before
