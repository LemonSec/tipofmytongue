1
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,209
and you shoot someone from Princeton
University and today I will talk

2
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:20,810
wrapped or rocky attacks on privacy
toward and this is a joint working

3
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,840
between researchers at princeton
university as well as ETH zürich and I

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,230
would also like to thank my co-author
morrow member area for contributing this

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,230
light we are anonymous

6
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,269
I'm sure everyone here is familiar with
this logo as well as to senate empowered

7
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:47,839
by the famous hacker today I will show
you that it's actually quite hard to

8
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:52,929
stay anonymous for long on the internet
even when using at best

9
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:59,600
anonymity systems such as tour because
of routing protocol we all love to hate

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,190
border gateway protocol BGP the problem
of anonymity on the internet

11
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,110
roots back to the design of the Internet
Protocol itself

12
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,450
indeed I P does not provide a non-empty
at all and anyone that's able to

13
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,110
eavesdrop on the Internet communication
can identify who is talking to whom

14
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:30,090
simply by looking at the IP has also
seems an IP address serves both for

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,680
identifying and locating an interface
eavesdroppers can also infer the

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,100
physical locations of the communication
entities from there it is easy to track

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,630
user behavior and interests this problem
remains even if the communication is

18
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,070
encrypted

19
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:58,210
the problem anonymity systems such as
toria have been designed for provides

20
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,469
anonymity by hiding IP header and
prevents attacker from associating a

21
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:10,160
source with a destination for the stop
by bouncing your traffic on top of an

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,840
overlay network composed of three types
of release first one entry really

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,380
constitute the entry points to the tour
now Rick Lee receive traffic from the

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,100
Klein and balance it to the middle
really really the ambassador to the exit

25
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,579
plan which finally fence the traffic to
the destination server to initiate

26
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:41,410
communication but cork line whereas the
lacZ 3 release one of each type then

27
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,570
encrypted palos

28
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:52,600
once the Thomas have been Butte
anonymous communication can happen by

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:00,410
forwarding and routing traffic across
the tunnels the reason why this scheme

30
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,660
provides an awesome he is that not a
single tourist entity can map the client

31
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,478
to the server for instance the entry
rellenos thesaurus for not that that's

32
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:18,199
in the middle really knows neither the
source not the destination while the AXA

33
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:26,250
rellenos the destination another source
even though note or entity can directly

34
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,299
knows both the source and the
destination the traffic entering and

35
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,699
leaving tori is actually highly
correlated and by correlating such

36
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:42,359
trying to entry and exit to server
traffic flows one can effectively the

37
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:48,380
anonymized or users you are there to
perform such choppered correlation that

38
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,448
tax the adversary's need to see both
climbed entry and exit to server traffic

39
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:02,609
and the question is how can the first
review that their first win

40
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,829
manipulate inquiry by running malicious
Relais or a compromising on earth were

41
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,709
really see other to observe the tour
traffic or instead of controlling a

42
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,959
related adversaries can manipulate
internet to pull itself onto the path at

43
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,760
both ends of the communication which
will be the focus of the stock

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,920
here's a simple apology

45
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,730
decline is uploading some file to the
web server connection according to BGP

46
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:47,210
and they the packets start to flow
through the esses the traffic collision

47
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,960
at PAX require the anniversary to see
also climbed to entry and exit will

48
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,960
serve a traffic so he needs to be on
both past and hear a yes five is only

49
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,200
passable fans so they can perform their
traffic correlation analysis and such

50
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:15,530
numbers are not based on previous work
however all this previous works assume

51
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,169
that the Internet is that the BGP
routing does not change which window is

52
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:28,600
not the case and the question we asked
and the study was the impact on poor

53
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:38,050
that the Internet is dynamic short
answer is user a non-empty decreases and

54
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,130
will show it by introducing three new
attacks are trapped or attacks the

55
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,640
following you three aspects of BGP
routing dynamics first asymmetric value

56
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:58,010
that the path from A to B is often
different from the path of natural

57
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,250
beauty become free agents should be
running could be changing all the time

58
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,900
your policy changes link failures and
Exeter and lastly active

59
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:16,250
manipulation by launching a BGP prefix
hijacking or intersection I was started

60
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,009
by showing up the peace three attacks

61
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:26,689
attack number one it's a matter of
rallying it increases the number of BS

62
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:35,819
level it so far we have only considered
the one side of the tour traffic

63
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:45,879
entry and exit 27 however because of
policies rather he is often a symmetric

64
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,229
the path from the entry back to the
client will be different as shown here

65
00:06:51,229 --> 00:07:01,020
while a is for those not declined entry
traffic now is seized entry per client

66
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:10,378
traffic on the river scalp and the same
applies to server to exit traffic in

67
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,639
terms of timing properties both sides of
a TCP connection are highly correlated

68
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,899
traditional traffic correlation only
uses the actual data packets to perform

69
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:28,699
the correlation say a client is
uploading a file to a web server only

70
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:37,789
bas that's on the client entry and exit
to server power pack however the reverse

71
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:43,878
direction of the traffic which is TCP
acts is equivalent to see that they are

72
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,339
traffic as we can retrive packet size
information from the Act fields in the

73
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:56,499
TCP header therefore if it yes it's on
the rivers have that cannot be served

74
00:07:56,499 --> 00:08:04,610
the TCP ACK traffic it is also a
compromising position so considering

75
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,249
only one direction only s5 is
potentially compromise but after

76
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:18,039
considering both directions now airs
three and four are also potentially

77
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:25,769
compromising therefore by exploiting
such a symmetric adversary's can

78
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:31,770
compromise store a lot more effectively
than previously thought

79
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:38,409
attack number and true natural BJP that
makes it increases the number of BS

80
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:47,160
level at the same exam hope initially
only s5 is compromising let's assume

81
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,500
that the link between a s4 and s5 fails
so is five cannot go to ask for the

82
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,810
record anymore and traffic

83
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:06,550
bas now both AF three and five are
seeing both ends of the traffic where

84
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,660
they're both at the compromising
position in addition to only s5 at the

85
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,420
beginning and therefore its level at
four surgeries can leverage such a

86
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,089
rocking chair in BGP protocol to
compromise the security of tour over

87
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:31,300
time a tax number three BJP hijacked so
far the first two wrapped or attacks

88
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,439
have only looked at passive attacks now
we will consider the case of an active

89
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,620
a/s level of Packer which can launch a
BGP prefix hijacking attack again the

90
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:51,300
same example initially only s5 is
compromised assume that a yes three is a

91
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,920
malicious a/s and wants to observe
toward traffic now when he needs to do

92
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:05,240
is to put itself onto the path from exit
to server access it has IP 1000 that one

93
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:14,760
and if I S A S six is announcing the
covering prefix / 1683 can launch a more

94
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:22,439
specific a prefix hijacking attack by
announcing a longer prefix / 24 here and

95
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,820
the scenes BGP always prefers longer
prefix is so the traffic now that's

96
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,339
destined for a yes

97
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,630
weeks will go to a S three steps

98
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,510
therefore by actively launching an
attack a malicious a/s like a estar here

99
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:47,650
can put itself on to the position of
compromising tour and such BJP hijacks

100
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:56,010
happening reward this is in Assad's EGP
hijack that happening April 1914 elite

101
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:04,500
more than 320 kbp routes multiple times
over two hours and their immune attack

102
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,750
for the import war really affected which
include 30 a card and 17 excerpt

103
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:21,220
released eleven of them were both garden
exit now we will demonstrate the attacks

104
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,290
by performing them in real-world
experiments there is a symmetric traffic

105
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:34,760
analysis is highly efficient we set up
to 50 toward clients and fifty HTTP web

106
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,950
servers Manalapan machines each torrent
client will start downloading a hundred

107
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:48,380
megabytes of files at the same time or
from one of the 50 service we collected

108
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:56,850
both direction of the traffic at both
hands as pointed out on this craft after

109
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,730
five minutes we were able to the
anonymized about 95% of the peers with

110
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,570
no false positives and seen seeing
either direction at both ends would be

111
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,320
sufficient with other asymmetric traffic
analysis so therefore waste to come back

112
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,750
to correlate the traffic as shown here
that they do versus they had in the last

113
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:22,000
column is equivalent to your traditional
traffic analyses which use only the

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,250
packets well in the first column it only
uses Mac vs AK which is asked effect if

115
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,860
any others

116
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,970
the detection accuracy rate quickly
increases with time it reaches about 80%

117
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,580
with being only a minute and eventually
reaches about 95 percent in five minutes

118
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:58,860
next BGP trance significantly increases
the number of compromising Estes mejor

119
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:06,030
de facto BGP true by collecting pgp babe
it for a month in January this year we

120
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:15,170
collected 250 BGP sessions 550 K BJP
prefixes and 600 dpi updates including

121
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:23,160
announcement and withdraws we consider
each BGP session as a poor user or

122
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:31,520
destination we attend the list of core
entry and exit Relais and now each

123
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:41,520
session we computed the a sec used to
reach each entry and exit release here

124
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:51,250
for you es X mas y are both on path here

125
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,160
and the answer is compromising when it
ends up simultaneously on the source

126
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:05,290
entry and exit destination path so here
if x is compromising for the tourist

127
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:12,660
circuit g1 g2 which other card and exit
and also asked one st to which are the

128
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:21,170
source and destination we've been
compared the number of such compromising

129
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:30,579
a ESAs before and after considering pgp
trim adds access here is still racial

130
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,990
after number of compromise the torso
case when considering track over a way

131
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:43,800
without considering trend sixty percent
of the best source destination parents

132
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,969
to use an increase of compromise so case
which is the part to the right off the

133
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,230
one on the x axis and planning percent
off the period

134
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:04,000
increase of more than 50% so from the
real GDP and where they don't we show

135
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,540
that BGP true significance significant
increases in the number of compromising

136
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:21,530
a ESAs finally BJP hijack works in a
while we have successfully performed a

137
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:28,720
PGP attack on an existing door entry
really our experiments did not

138
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,310
compromise the privacy or safety of
realtor your service attack our own

139
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,270
traffic we attacked our own really and
we fire water our really not drop any

140
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:45,240
traffic not generated by US tour user
will not pick our religious their court

141
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:58,080
we hosted and truly impressed with the
IPO 184 at 161

142
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:06,070
and we advertise the covering IP prefix
Georgia yes / 23 prefix georgette

143
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,220
acrylate on prefix to the entire
internet and toward traffics rather to

144
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:20,860
blow after 20 seconds we announced a
more specific prefix BRB I sis which is

145
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,010
/ 24

146
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:30,160
BGP forwarding is based on the longest
match odds happy will soon start to

147
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,069
enter via ISI you said of george attack
and this whole convergence time was

148
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:43,040
about 35 seconds after I S I made the
announcement here see you let's

149
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,060
straighten up traffic flowed back so at
the beginning

150
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:53,569
traffic was flowing through the judge
attack BS on a pop and their twenty

151
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,280
seconds hijack begins so traffics switch
over to ISI and rent from georgette and

152
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,040
this is when hijack and so traffic goes
back to Georgia Tech again by

153
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,780
correlating TCP ACK traffic collected at
ISI which is the militias is here with

154
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,470
the TCP ACK traffic collected at the
HTTP web service we were able to

155
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:28,830
anonymous about 90% of the piers this is
an example of uncorrelated period of the

156
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,020
actress is a key analysis in the
hijacker experiment so the x axis of

157
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:43,040
their time and Y axis it's the traffic
flow and the life of a client who likes

158
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,720
the server and you can tell that they're
not correlate and on the contrary this

159
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:55,320
is an example of a correlated pair Egypt
interception that hacks are closer than

160
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,620
90% of the prefix is hosting relays are
shot / honey for many of their brother

161
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,020
about to such more specific prefix
attacks

162
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,160
known that tax they'd already intercept
or traffic for example in this Sept 24

163
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,220
team more than four relays were affected
during the hijacking attack seventy

164
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,700
prefix is host about 30% of all entries
and access and there are now about only

165
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:31,610
six AFIS so if any of those six AE says
he's hijacked a lot of correlation could

166
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:38,850
be potentially affected as well now
we're gonna talk about potential

167
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:46,300
countermeasures against such wrapped
worth's to protect myself or should

168
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:53,379
become more aware of the network
underlying for example Kinston natural

169
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,500
dynamic zoom in Bijapur we could
potentially prefer using stable release

170
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:08,990
and we can obtain that information by
using tools like BJP monetary my

171
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:16,100
computer got stuck

172
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,928
and I can keep going the second one you
can barely see very thrilled

173
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:28,700
manipulation active BJP attacks we can
potentially discards suspicious and

174
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,460
preferred using closer relations and we
can do that by utilizing tools like BJP

175
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,690
monetary as well and also using BGP sack
to validate prefix announcement by yeses

176
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,750
so you cannot announce a prefix that
does not belong to you

177
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:55,299
comes up here ok the last month
asymmetric analyses it'll be quite hard

178
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:01,139
to different against such attacks we can
encrypt PCP headers which will prevent

179
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,850
the jury from knowing any use for
information from it and we can do that

180
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,039
by using ice

181
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:15,908
however these kind of measures might
help but they also come with trails for

182
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:20,909
example the first two economist writers
they're putting more trust on the

183
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:25,159
smaller amount of release so they're
giving more power to fewer release which

184
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:31,000
could be potentially dangerous and the
last one crippling TCP header it's not

185
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,539
really a widely used now because of its
high cost so it's gonna be easy to

186
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:47,450
detect and BGP is not only a problem for
tour you see news article from last year

187
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:56,630
the hackers exploited pgp attacks to try
to steal bitcoins and here nineteen

188
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,140
internet service providers were
effective India pack and other hosting

189
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:10,240
services like Oviatt also affect only
future is actually that Hop Abs terms of

190
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,840
number of poor relation hosted in
summary

191
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,668
Internet routing matters when it comes
to use the Christmas user and on them

192
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:29,390
over time the threat is real apec's are
you fishin as we demonstrated our

193
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,460
real-world experiments and
countermeasures help but to an extent

194
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,809
it's not trivial to be on the counter
measure to against such attacks and

195
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:50,780
thank you again for coming to my talk I
will take questions

196
00:21:50,780 --> 00:22:08,639
great stuff it's interesting that the
first couple of attacks you point out

197
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,530
the defense seems to be reduce your
service area so against the the

198
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:20,010
asymmetric routing if only we have fewer
guard notes then we're exposing the

199
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,550
traffic to fewer places and against the
dynamic BGP issues if only we have fewer

200
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,720
guard nodes then we're exposing traffic
to fewer places where is the third

201
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,430
attack the having a more centralized
concentrated place where your traffic

202
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,800
goes makes it more dangerous because if
I only have one guard and that's the one

203
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,139
that I used for a long time then you
have a lot of chances to try to attack

204
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,650
traffic for that particular guard so it
seems like we've got a trade off your do

205
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,510
you have any intuition about how to get
away from that

206
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,980
yeah it's a hard crash there at that
point

207
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:07,010
prefer but on the other hand basket but
actually fixing relays for a certain

208
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,030
amount helps actually fix

209
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,240
south of the card release for a period
of nine months or so basically if

210
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,190
selects three-card really and pick one
of them were a period of nine months and

211
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,720
then after that he might change the
itself so by this way the risks of you

212
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,830
are picking like RAM relay switch
increase your chance of being exposed to

213
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,530
more yeses so and the period this month
by month because of the truth if you fix

214
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:47,820
it for everything not good so and there
are a lot of interesting research in the

215
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:54,060
path selection how can you optimize the
selection to minimize your risk of

216
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,360
anonymized

217
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:07,750
as well so you mentioned you so I can
deal with it

218
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:15,200
asymmetric my understanding is that
he'll get some timing information out of

219
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,990
the college credit it should be fairly
easy its just don't have the volume

220
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,520
information right looks at how much how
much traffic analysis you could do just

221
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:34,040
from the timing information we didn't
already do that all the previous traffic

222
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,399
regulation that is where it looks like
the Packers signs like you need to

223
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,059
retrieve anything from the TCP header
you're just look at the packet size

224
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:50,399
storage it's packaged in like a uniform
size of 512 bytes so I just looking at

225
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,720
the size of the package and how often
the package arrives you can kind of but

226
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:06,070
it's just we use a different way here
about looking up PCB header

227
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,129
ok if there's no other questions let's
think
