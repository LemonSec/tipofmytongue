1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,390
thank you thank you for introduction
hello everyone my name is young I'm a

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,710
graduate student

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,750
and this great honor for me to present a
paper here the topic is cloudy with a

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,429
chance of rage forecasting severs carry
instance this is John worries my

5
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:32,738
colleagues army gene karen is from
michigan militia magic's a call from you

6
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:39,399
are you see and my the wiser me from
Michigan so we were increasingly

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,300
frequent and high impact did bridges is
not so hard to name a few high-profile

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,319
his turn in the year 2000 4000 can save
big names here

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,219
target JPMorgan Home Depot to just name
for you and each other instance incurs

10
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,609
massive private mission stolen lakh such
as employees mission customer credit

11
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,619
card information cetera and August
numbers if he remembers me to encourage

12
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,850
give us very direct evidence that
appears increasingly social economic

13
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,759
impact from such instance so however
current approaches against such break a

14
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,440
mostly detection based and detection
based masur

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,229
attack on many times it's too late as
temperatures detective their phones and

16
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,140
no suitable for cost a damage control
and we do see it as Arjun need for more

17
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,270
practical matters so to put our
discussion on the difference between

18
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,869
detection and proactive measures of
production in contacts so detection

19
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:46,649
analogy is kevin is now just took that
goes in patients who may already be many

20
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,149
existing works for example the spam
detection fraud detection Mauritius

21
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:56,920
account attaching sector but prediction
is I'm predicting lazar a prison a

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,030
healthy person may become based on a
variety of factors and there are

23
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,209
relatively last works on this category
last year as Sebastian paper went to

24
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:14,420
Costco and Christian 40 quite work on
predicting whether or not the near

25
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,619
future and this type of work this paper
is interest and also we are really glad

26
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,299
to see this year as you say we are
witnessing you more people on this topic

27
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,680
especially since this session I very
much look forward to season

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,260
back to topic our goal is to understand
to what extent weekend forecast instance

29
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,409
on additional hour and to achieve this
goal objective is to develop the ability

30
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:47,370
to forecast security instance with the
following properties the first property

31
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,980
is applicability so we want to rely
solely I strongly absorb so that we do

32
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,119
not require any information on the
internal working in our work is host

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,329
organization of the company says that we
are not backing for admission from

34
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:08,609
organization to organization the second
wise robustness so we are reminded to

35
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,519
carry on this analysis but we do not
have any control over a direct knowledge

36
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,069
of the data we collected so awesome
message that a guest annie dookhan nice

37
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,790
so that key idea is tapping into them
were set of data capture different

38
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:29,319
aspects in our security posture ranging
from explains it to Layton why

39
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,879
prediction after all and if we ever
succeed what are the benefits we rented

40
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,069
committee so focus our prediction there
was entirely new classes applications

41
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,690
which are otherwise not feasible for
instance prediction of lost track

42
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,629
tomorrow policy on measures to be
adopted acting matters and focusing

43
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:55,888
their most effective recent measurements
games for instance as internal

44
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,349
transition from iphone this area or
resource allocation house to allocate

45
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:05,569
our resources on different security
issues and as extra not well as issue we

46
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:13,099
can develop incentive mechanism social
several tries to offer so here's all our

47
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:20,519
target has some preliminaries and our
target is focusing masur the last part

48
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,199
will be forecasting results as well as
analysis or certain observations we saw

49
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:32,509
them abused may be useful I T Y getting
to details we can t quick glance at this

50
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:38,260
hour me how this started rely mainly on
three categories of data the first is

51
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,820
missing measurements in terms of seconds
and malicious activity

52
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,060
to seller data are used to extract
features to describe now works posture

53
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:54,060
and also referred to as security posture
data asserted wise is a report they are

54
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,890
published reports summarizing that
happen to you last two years so we use

55
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,419
this data to try and test our classifier
to surrender labels so first I first

56
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,140
secured possibly the first set of secure
data is just miss manners and post them

57
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:15,260
see our intuitions from known best
practice on IP addresses and he's just

58
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:22,070
artist Rd if if I was him namely miss
customer issue TBS occasion mr. feared

59
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,080
an ass including of your cursor is over
and saw speranza Asian male soldiers and

60
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:34,140
BGP but notice that now this fisher's
ties directly to this vulnerability of

61
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,210
this bridge but they are indicators of a
policy of expertise for instance if

62
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,630
oxidation cannot you can see yourself a
pitch crack today we believe there's a

63
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,350
higher chance for them to be permission
to end this data are collected around me

64
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,820
though to some searching the reason is
we want them to be prior to any instance

65
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:03,330
we collected so we are using the pass
data to predict the future is these are

66
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,000
sooo 11 reputation blacklist dr Dale
attractions at the address engaging

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,070
activities and interests Rd in this
study we have three malicious activity

68
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,210
type numerous bombings Beijing us again
and we have it I'm serious correction

69
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,409
was made by searching after December 20
40 noticed that isn't much more dynamic

70
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,500
compared to previous data wish I'm gonna
show later so we can now utilize this

71
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,010
step dynamics and also noticed even
though we have four period time of

72
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:43,170
collection for a pretty sure we're all
done it before so current sources to do

73
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:50,419
production so we rely Austria public
sources artistry this are publicly

74
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,490
available they may have magadan website
isn't it

75
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,380
but they are overdue format and CRM
reporting emergency

76
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,099
isn't types report they are both very
different format and different Calgary's

77
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,349
like SQL injection including SQL
injection hijacking official Accenture

78
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:17,830
so as you may notice a verse on the
other hand are you married to former

79
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,190
even though we are desiring desire for
diversity in the data still there are

80
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,250
some troubles we gonna clean instance

81
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,659
reporting format so who r group spent
quite a bit actress are reading this

82
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,219
report

83
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,400
extracting key terms from the report and
put them into a uniform case so we can't

84
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,690
do analysis and second we want to remove
enrollment cases for example if only the

85
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,680
databases are some reports earlier store
so some other cases saying something

86
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,289
happen but we don't know what happen as
these cases are definitely relevant to

87
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:58,199
our study so we need to kick up my shirt
is almost RT secondly this diversity

88
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,460
prison challenging airlines I mean time
and space for instance posture record

89
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,479
record information as well as you can
imagine a report a source of his

90
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,090
organization without pointing out to a
specific Michelle IP address and two

91
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,179
alliances

92
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,240
sorry to analyze this data is not
trivial says just makes this boundary

93
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,729
between has issued a clear to us that we
were proposing menu mapping process we

94
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:37,240
first summarize or not I D from his five
yr originally tonight and for many

95
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,419
prefix is listed under 2.6 minute when I
D so that we are starting with three

96
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,640
many roughly three media organizations
can't care analysis over notices

97
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,250
offender degree compared to rot in table
and we simply IP address for use on a

98
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,190
query of man you search and the research
this IP address

99
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:06,920
be able to find a block action address
and showering Seimone I D ok so in this

100
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
way

101
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,250
organization to block IP addresses and
associated data all the features are

102
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,550
extracted from data to the organization
through this action boggs

103
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:26,370
messer quick look as it approached we
first started with a check more than 250

104
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,300
features some days that end we summarize
them as primary features a second

105
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,599
features

106
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,380
generate labels for this incident is
that and we trained classifier using

107
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,939
rainforest which is essentially an
extension to cut this entry measure just

108
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,310
looks pretty standard but most I first
saw action and generation and creamy so

109
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,550
first feature extraction so travelers
features supreme fisheries essentially

110
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,329
zero data the statistics we can
calculate directly from this road is we

111
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:01,200
conducted the first cell is a fight miss
measurements and podiums so far we have

112
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,140
five pitchers correspondingly issues
Fisher Marisa fraction fraction of

113
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:12,180
somatic I D with the organization for
instance was entrusted issue 2 vs Duke

114
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,010
asian shares fisher's Mary diffraction
web service that has an trusses that the

115
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:23,710
occasion of autos is total number of
serious response to our skin and

116
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,530
similarly we define special for other
other other symptoms which can do it

117
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:34,699
quick city after firing also features to
say whether they are in a great example

118
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,230
here so you could see the CDF and this
is just reactions of features is a

119
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,380
victimization victimization tend to have
a much larger fraction and chassis that

120
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,230
occasion compared to an amateur musician
and officials can very well tell us on

121
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:57,810
the other side features malicious
activity features so this time series

122
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,369
data we have straight time series data
corresponding to a three types of and

123
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:09,750
fishing us can we take to muster a time
for fish action to my spirit I'm August

124
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,360
six days is a is a tradeoff between
accuracy and computation complexity and

125
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,630
we found empirically sixty skewers very
good performance but later russia is

126
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,390
second feature we also can add

127
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,680
recent 2 weeks later because six is a
long period of time

128
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,770
most Alec descriptions now work but
recent recent and relevant evidence of

129
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,260
his recent training so I can see
examples you can say these are several

130
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,330
examples they have very different
dynamics and emerging artists so we

131
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,860
conjecture is this difference can be
patting in terms of separating these two

132
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,580
curves and the last two states is number
address so this number to some extent to

133
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,760
capture the likelihood and isolation
becomes a target of a report attacks so

134
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,510
as we look service database based on me
aside from Laura says companies tend to

135
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:09,200
suffer more from a precious and base
future I'm going to proceed to second

136
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,640
nature second official moderated by
exactly by capturing these shapes the

137
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,610
different shapes his attempts as data is
on the rise or drop made you to their

138
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:28,200
responsiveness as I B team I T A Team
the security organization so we want to

139
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,970
capture such behavior when we called it
an behavior so some way we have more and

140
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:41,730
to to simplify it is just a temporary
data just a number and address it first

141
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,760
khakis Irish which is right line and so
we specify to / Sara C above the upper /

142
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,700
lower as compared to Magna canta
compared to average because it by region

143
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,340
RI saudis just number money should
address it hired and some / would

144
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,700
otherwise here

145
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:06,960
region are seeing the normal case so we
can start how long does it take issue

146
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,480
region so this matters secure effort and
responsiveness photos is part matters

147
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,840
persistency how long does it take

148
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,160
we headed by region for you to come back
with him as a virgin territory sheriff

149
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,949
frequency frequency essentially how
often do you hate each region again it

150
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,590
quick before you could say just just
features to different degrees can

151
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,170
separate it to do to go from one another

152
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,949
and I'm not gonna go through all the
details you say it is pertinent part

153
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:43,019
this is a city providing for bad
duration and you say victimization has a

154
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,050
much longer duration the marriage which
might indicate a much slower response of

155
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:56,810
time so I after because it features we
can attract a classifier so you two

156
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,449
groups

157
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:04,189
victim group in order to decide which is
taken from his recent report on a

158
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,870
separate separate incident reporting for
training and testing the split is this

159
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,459
debate is corning 28 2010 original
number seventy percent to serve as

160
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,479
trainee sorry for testing offered 250
unnoticed

161
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,260
so I started we mostly use fifty 50 but
this is not an aggressive number most

162
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,850
cases people use Niceville the test for
Jesse Marsch higher rate and also notice

163
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,329
a kid you friends here we strictly
latest data according to Tampa so we are

164
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:39,660
only using the pass data to predict
future in machine learning many times

165
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,010
these spaces shuttling is random
generated so this is determinations but

166
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,290
also we need to we need to family
friends and we need to find a subset of

167
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,709
victimization to pair up with
politicians so we would do this with

168
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:58,819
random subsample it is a big table as I
mentioned earlier to find a group is

169
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,820
comparable size why we do that because
we only have three hundred thousand

170
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,240
victims group by the house remaining
sessions so adding them together you are

171
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,269
not so very random subsample comparable
size of group to war imbalance as it

172
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,959
costs money but we can repeat this
process among the types of generate

173
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:27,529
different versions of classifier to some
guys each trial so there is the first we

174
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,880
do prediction very simple it works as
follows

175
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,269
there's a temple I the rest are so
instance so first issue is extracted

176
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,980
features after the month before

177
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,750
happen in the next 12 extraction
features on it and keep doing this

178
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,540
because his shot and produced production
so we are only predicting weather for

179
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,990
next month's there's going to be in
Sanaa not update feature extraction so

180
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,620
shattered Memories out our secret so the
form out true positive and false

181
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,990
positive notices a true positive rate of
false-positive rate so anomalies number

182
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:13,810
is 202 I DR four career corresponding to
our experiment over three eastern India

183
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:23,079
SAT as a coalition service as a cross
but generally how well range operating

184
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,460
point so I each curve different point
corresponding to different so I should

185
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,000
remember as a classifier

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,030
probability indicating the chance risk
the chance for a short position which

187
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,699
has further specify / 02 generally
before it so different no corresponding

188
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,080
to different russia and issued note as a
mission earlier is average or among the

189
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:50,280
trials and in general we can say we have
outraged offering point and we can for

190
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,230
others for cases we can achieve ninety
per senator positive with 10 percent of

191
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:02,910
US policy in particular will check it in
person as 4% the first party to remember

192
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,220
next four percent are you in 10 percent
positive prediction is not as bad as

193
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,540
detection so we are not blocking all
we're not gonna see you are simply send

194
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:18,010
the early alarm money we just missed a
great and also attach this material are

195
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,650
in fact so you can see the drinker is
with Saudi hire training data

196
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,720
African ass a better performers as you
may expect and also we got us is

197
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,830
questionable if we do long-term
protection status with do not obtain

198
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,889
sufficient traction maritime four ish
instant fix this extraction tape

199
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,940
only gonna generate predictions for next
few months on next year so it's what we

200
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,480
do for sale on production again which
has this case against a long-term

201
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,880
prediction has aside a worse performance
is comparable and the difference in the

202
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,530
performance contracts due to the
temporal features are extracted outdated

203
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,010
right so we are not operating
temperatures

204
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,330
at a monthly basis so performance and
also as a by-product of his machine

205
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,240
learning process

206
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,650
importance of Fisher's operated along
with his labors so this feature sessions

207
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,590
various colors ranging from 0 to 12
higher than number is the better as more

208
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,459
important fisheries so it's a top-four
fisher's

209
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,080
say to miss measure officials wrecking
top four and high school wise and

210
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,850
trusted application just makes sense to
us as we look as inside managed

211
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:37,080
operations actually related to 20 web
servers as it entered point so powerful

212
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,860
indicator we can do other many other
observations for example we can

213
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,800
summarize important feature and we can
rank so we thought mismanagement either

214
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,300
so far is the most powerful descriptor
and more recently we found a second

215
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,669
procedure are almost as important as
this country since the second official

216
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,030
were extracted from time-series data
from more serious perspective you're not

217
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,920
any any commission but why it's so
significant

218
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,410
the reason is the classifier cannot read
the data is optimal way as you expect so

219
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,900
when you to manipulate the data manually
and push them into pacifier and also is

220
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,790
summarized it features the duration
frequency if they are much more

221
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,760
important Compostela features

222
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:33,180
since we thought many starting this area
is to capture the study data but this is

223
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,320
saying more attention to the dynamics
measures that may be more talent in

224
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:44,600
terms of these Terms different
objectives at all are not sharing

225
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,350
comparable results cannot rely on going
to erode their sauce to the prediction

226
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:55,360
when you combine all of them to utilize
its diversity alright so she started

227
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
back to original President Kennedy fuck
a security so this is a simple

228
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,800
realization was at one point on the
performance curve so it is a CDF

229
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:10,440
preparing for one particular classify
robert is performed kirk and his broker

230
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,910
is a profiling

231
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,340
number

232
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,439
station and factories for weeks
motivation right so you can easily see

233
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,240
your shoes defense took hers it's not so
surprising following our observations on

234
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,600
the successes classified as we can with
high probability you can tell when so

235
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,659
you can imagine her should be separate
from each other to kiss artists are

236
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,100
organizations on different regions of
the curb to say it will make his

237
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,090
organization state in different area
like true positive active researcher and

238
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,760
we also write down the high profile they
bridges on the record you can safely

239
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,950
capture song EP Home Depot target and
they are very high numbers and might

240
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,500
receive a refund on a tax on them with a
number being point 92 so you may not

241
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,830
attack was a wonder when there for
JPMorgan was really

242
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:13,870
responsibility for the liberation I
think I'm going to complement our data

243
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:21,379
show sirasa process is part of the other
but our premise to automate replication

244
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,040
come from the prediction accuracy as
long as as long as it stays decent

245
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,170
performance

246
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:34,110
individual error does not matter too
much second we test our measure against

247
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:41,050
Russia data observing the popularity of
the reason is if we can learn to be more

248
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:47,280
haters than $10 so they can inject
malicious data towards our new strategy

249
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,970
so it has a measure against against such
cases due to pressure the random

250
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,810
sampling and that run the trials of
training classify our second we had

251
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,629
never set of features so unless you have
a large amount of resources to attack

252
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:12,510
the emotions is cut if I share your big
picture of his prediction certainly so

253
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,240
far only talk about protection measures
year is going to be insane and not talk

254
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,330
too much about what

255
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,199
instances could be this is a minute due
to it don't have enough samples to trade

256
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,900
cars fire individual types of what we do

257
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,670
the best way to that one particular type
of appreciation by publication is on

258
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:38,260
more than 300 samples inspired fashion
show similar results this is reporting

259
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,030
out paper so you take a look but we also
found two recent papers are trying to

260
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:48,450
solve this problem with smoke aerosol
concentrations wise from systematic

261
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,840
are using sex information and business
mission a mission to try to predict some

262
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,760
targeted attacked and while I work
groups recent paper appeared couple

263
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,170
months ago a Weiss is talking about how
to use additional additional data such

264
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,030
as a business seller information data to
generate conditional probability

265
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,960
distribution over different types

266
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,150
this is a condition on production
conditions are a son is happening over

267
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,360
to victimize

268
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,560
either so sort of like a social this
paper so you may want to check out

269
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,409
merely

270
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:31,290
discussions with historically high
schools into a quality of data grossly

271
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:39,960
underreported and even within the report
are so many powers so we as we are

272
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,810
assuring the paper we already benefiting
by

273
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:49,389
with limited reporting so we're not
terribly report more and wish our case

274
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,360
as its web page so you can take a look
to use for our research verification

275
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:01,899
covers business I come from a talk I we
stand a chance for their tony thank you

276
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:12,780
for your attention at like to take any
questions their hero thank you

277
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:33,740
interesting has happened in the past
predictions for the next year and can we

278
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,340
see next year you guarantee what

279
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:45,520
so yeah we jump through some of the post
so if you can you can definitely some

280
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,870
profiles for for the future but we
really appears as we were in 2013

281
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,500
whatever we know is in 2013 so we we
were acting as we were into a certain

282
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:05,240
that is similar to we are now at 1560
but definitely we are generating

283
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,640
profiles for next year so you may come
back to me to realize is that on the

284
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,380
same page as we have contact information
direct knowledge on me because you're

285
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:31,350
shooting from the University of Maryland
so your profile these organizations say

286
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,570
with some of those certainly that they
are likely going to be breached in the

287
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:41,240
future there you know based on your
profiles are their recommendations that

288
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,260
you can issue those organizations to
prevent these bridges yes we can

289
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,790
generate especially the reason we are
doing this is to which feature matters

290
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:57,639
more towards its prediction and that we
have a funny recognition we would like

291
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,640
to make to the organization we can
further look at Sears feature set to say

292
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,730
which feature our profile in this
production process is both combining

293
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,590
sufficient policy in different ways to
generate number that's a big question is

294
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,270
you can see which he just turns out but
can you verify that this is the way they

295
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,490
were happy even if they fix their
certificates that prevent the hack

296
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:31,300
yes it's for example we observe some
cases we can taxes organizations you are

297
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:38,559
in the high risk to reply to us why we
look at your dick rutan higher fraction

298
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,740
of entrances at occasions so please fix
them are you have already higher number

299
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,809
of British try to fix them so we can
offer such a condition to go we can look

300
00:26:47,809 --> 00:27:07,620
at this number of features and I am so
impressed

301
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:17,989
Canada follow up when you're talking
about using management mismanagement

302
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:25,000
indicators to as a proxy for a general
organization that puts them at risk

303
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,490
why do you bother telling them that they
have misconfigured HCPs servers when you

304
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,440
better fix their general management
problem that has that is one of the

305
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:42,740
symptoms I think they are not definite
are not direct causal factors to any

306
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,500
particular bridge the crib you very
looks like you look at look just look as

307
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,350
officials agree very much irrelevant but
I think this up to some extent to

308
00:27:53,350 --> 00:28:00,770
indicate as a mission management
policies so as external factors may be

309
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:08,900
relevant licences are leading some
correlation factors factors assembly
